As the title suggests, I have never been an avid reader. I have read few books until now but I am willing to change that fact. However, I have come to realize that after finishing reading a certain book, I will usually forget most of the details about it. For instance, *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* is one of the latest novels I read last year. I vaguely remember the themes associated with the novel and one specific dinner table scene. Rest is pretty much history at this point. I do not even remember the plot to be honest.  


The reason why this bothers me is because it makes me feel like no matter how much I read, I will always internalize very little of it. I have always envied the university lecturers who would know the most interesting details about a book or ask the most intruguing questions, but I remember little to nothing a week after reading. Am I doomed to be a hopeless intellectual? Does this happen to anyone else?","I am not a bookworm at all and I want to change that, but there is one thing that bothers me a lot.",1610230021

I have made it my ambition to real as much of the world’s classic, influential, and infamous literature as I can in a lifetime. When I set out on this journey, I decided to start with the most difficult book I knew of, War and Peace (I didn’t know about Ulysses at the time…). I took myself to the local library and checked out a copy. The huge volume’s cover has been damaged and replaced by the library staff with a plain paper one with a hand written spine. Well, I didn’t need fancy cover art anyway. I made my way through the book and, nine hundred pages later, the story came to an abrupt end, followed by an afterword by the publisher reading something more or less like this:

“We hope you have enjoyed this short transcription of the recently discovered early manuscript version of Tolstoy’s magnum opus, and hope that it has granted the reader additional insight into the full, canonical version of the story, the one with the proper ending. Hahaha.”

I have since read the full version. Whenever I hear someone complain about WaP having two epilogues, I always think to myself, “it could be worse: you could have NO epilogues!”",War &amp; Peace &amp; a Horror Story,1610223132

On the other hand, it also adresses China in great lengths, particularly how China is using AI to create a totalitarian surveillence state, whose lenghts not even Orwell could imagine. 

The two parts above are absolutely not fiction, and ars based on numerous scientific books, papers and articles that the author lists in the end.

The glue to all of this is the fictional part, which I will not discuss here as to keep the book interesting and spoiler-free for those reading it.

books,"Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson 
(Stormlight Achieve #2)
RATING: 5/5

A phenomenal follow up to the Way of Kings. Words of Radiance made The Ways of Kings look like a prequel. TWoK set up all the pieces in the story, built the world and set the rules. Then WoR took it up a notch and got the story rolling. It's like leaving a cart near a cliff (book 1) and then pushing it off the cliff (book 2). Since Sanderson invested a lot into TWoK, WoR  was an enormous reward. Characters that were independently developing got to crossover and also the spotlight changed to another character. In WoK, Kaladin was the main focus of the story, but here the main focus was Shallan. I wasn't interested her plotline as much as Kaladin's in WoK, but Sanderson managed to turn that around here. A lot of gaps were filled and Shallan grew into a very complex character. My favorite character was Adolin tho; he's basically a side character to everyone's plotline, but he's SUCH an intriguing character! His influence on all the characters made everything so much more interesting. He stole the show for me in this book (unpopular opinion I know), despite the ""main"" characters being Dalinar, Kaladin and Shallan.",Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson,1610221297

And who can blame them? Those books are pretty much the only popular sci-fi comedies there are, I've seen some people lump Dirk Gently in there as well but I don't agree with that at all.

It's an extremely open, inspiring and creatively freeing genre that is rarely explored (in contrast to it's cousin genre, fantasy comedies).

I know a few published and writers and it was shocking to here their opinions on this genre's stagnation. Publishers said that sci-fi comedies ""rarely sell or advertise well"" while the writers thought that they were quite ""unintellectual"" when compared to what it's parodying.
Fantasy is inherently, well, fastastical so it's easier to adversite or write while sci-fi comedies are to much of a derivative of it's original work.

I enjoy reading in English (not my native language) and so one of the only options I have to buy books is through Book Depository. Amazon is quite expensive (due to shipping), it's hard to find English books in local bookstores (and they are usually more expensive), so Book Depository seems like a nice option. I've been buying Penguin paperback books (such as this one: [https://www.bookdepository.com/Jane-Eyre-Charlotte-Bronte/9780141198859?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1610213013426&amp;sr=1-3](https://www.bookdepository.com/Jane-Eyre-Charlotte-Bronte/9780141198859?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1610213013426&amp;sr=1-3)). The quality overall doesn't seem bad, but being mass marketed paperbacks, I do realize it's probably not the best.

Since I will be continue buying books for the foreseeable future, and thus start building my library, I'd like that my books to last more than a couple of years. And that's what I'm worried: that I'm buying a lot of books that will start to show signs of age early. 

I do buy hardcovers, but only for those books I really enjoy (think collector's editions and the like). Since many books I just read because I'm interested in the story, and not as much as having the book, I prefer a cheaper paperback. But I still want to be able to keep the book, and possibly pass onto my kids, when I eventually have some.

I wanted to ask the opinions of avid book collectors, and based in your experiences, should I just keep buying Penguin paperbacks, should I buy every book as a hardcover, should I look into another publisher? Maybe my opinion of Penguin paperbacks is unjust? Any tips?","General opinion on quality of books, and what should I buy?",1610214376
