books,"I've been a big fan of Paul Tremblay's past work, and the premise of Survivor Song was very interesting. However, I'm about 40% in and I'm really struggling to finish. It's not necessarily a bad book, but it highlighted a problem I have with horror books that seems very common-place.

That is, why do so many authors HAVE to write main characters that are seemingly witty, funny, non-chalant, yet also somehow totally unprepared to deal with some unbelievably horrid situation? Further, why is so much dialogue dedicated to this sort of banter/inside jokes/etc in the middle of unimaginable situations?

Without giving spoilers (I'll just discuss what can be gleamed from the story descriptions/first few pages) the story centers around a rabies like virus that spreads very fast - creating a zombie apocalypse like scenario. The two main characters are a young doctor and her pregnant best friend who are trying to figure out how to navigate being in ground zero of this disease while also dealing with their own personal crisis. 

Again, I'm about 40% in and so far it just feels like 1 giant trope. A young doctor who has little to know idea about the severity of what's going on and is anxious because it's obvious the medical system is not prepared or training staff properly then spends almost all of her dialogue cracking jokes, reminiscing on past escapades in her youth, etc. A pregnant woman in the middle of an apocalypse facing probably the most horrid thing that could ever happen an hour ago joking about having to pee.

I can understand this in your typical Kindle Unlimited 10 part zombie series, but it's seriously frustrating how often solid writers resort to this (especially since Paul has several great books that aren't like this). I get that people handle stress and trauma differently, but the fact that so many horror writers do this and that it is so cartoonishly off tells me that they either don't care or don't bother to learn about how people deal with stress/trauma/anxious situations. 

What do you guys think? Do horror book main characters need to act like Dead Pool-lites/Mary Sues to attract a more wide audience, or should writers actually give characters and their emotions/behaviors some depth?",Paul Tremblay's Survivor Song and my problem with the way many horror authors write characters and dialogue.,1598811624
books,"5. Love triangle - we’ve all seen this one a LOT, i feel like it’s a go to for many writers (the hunger games, twilight etc.) it’s essentially 3 characters that are competing for eachothers love. It’s so painful to watch because there’s always that clear couple (edward &amp; bella are an example) however sometimes it’s a little hard to tell but even then you have somewhat of an idea. I give it a 2.5/5 because although it may be sometimes entertaining it is usually overused and just drags the plot for an unnecessary amount of times 
-
4. Best/Childhood...Friends to lovers - very wholesome, it has that beautiful sense of history to go with it. There is just the perfect amount of tension paired with the years of yearning. I love this trope because at first you get to see them build a bond before moving things into a more serious relationship lane . It’s so beautiful to watch two characters grow together. This gets a 3 or 4/5 because it honestly warms my heart to watch 
-
3. Soulmates - This is usually two people who the universe has paired together and instantly have an undeniable chemistry and bond. Of course it would be absolutely boring if all they did was meet, fall in love instantly and just live happily ever after, which is why i like when writers usually throw a curveball or something of the sort that the pair have to work through which truly showcases how much they belong  together. this gets a 4/5 because i do enjoy a good soulmate au

2. Fake relationships: when two characters have to pretend like they’re in love to get out of an awkward social situation (to all the boys i’ve loved before) or better yet when they agree to a marriage of convenience in order to subvert the law (Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith) but usually, what began as a fake relationship quickly turns into true love, and i think their rivalry and they unexpected will they/ won’t they of it all is and the fear of sending mixed singles and not knowing what’s real or what’s fake is so exciting to watch. 5/5 it’s definitely one of my favourites 
-
1. ENEMIES TO LOVERS- my absolute favourite trope( example: pride &amp; prejudice) it is usually two people who hate each others’ guts (sometimes miscommunication or reasons unknown) end up overcoming their differences and angst and ending the story with a (spoiler!) declaration of love. Its so amazing to watch because it have the years of history that the friends to lovers has and also has the uncertainty of the fake relationship especially when they put their differences aside to work together. i am honestly not doing it justice but done write this trope is so beautiful. 10000000/5

Also do you have a favorite genre? I love fantasy and horror and I like Sci-fi, but sometimes it's just too dense for me.

I see people reading like 100 books, 200 books, 30k pages and I'm like ""HOW???"". 

My recent years:

* 2016: 2271 pages (5 books)
* 2017: 245 pages (2 books) - my worst year
* 2018: 882 pages (3 books)
* 2019: 7473 pages (14 books) - started reading in August and I broke my 2000-2500 pages lifetime record
* 2020: 7541 pages (21 books)

My story:

I'm working full time and I cook twice a day every single day. I also consider myself as a cinephile (love cinema) and I also like watching TV shows (haven't watched for a while). My biggest hobby is playing  games. I've had days with 24 hours of nonstop playing games, but for the last years my average is around 4 hours a day during weekdays and around 8-10 hours during the weekend. Last August I found that I really enjoy reading books (The Stand and KKC series had really huge impact), but I can't read during the day. There are way too many distractions and temptations during the day. So I read almost EVERY night between 3:30-4am and 5-6am since last August (12-13 months ago). And I'm having a blast. Now I can work, cook, watch movies and TV series, play games, watch Twitch, YouTube and read books in bed in complete darkness (tried to read with lights on, it did not work for me).

If you find yourself struggling to read, try my strategy for sure - **go to bed 1 hour earlier and read** (if you have an e-book reader try reading in darkness). Silence helps a lot... at least to me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm interested to hear your stories. How many pages do you read per day/month/year, or how many books, or how many hours per day? Everyone has their own way for reading amount estimation. How do you make time to read without quitting watching TV, playing games or other hobbies? It is not a solution for me to quit your other hobbies to make more time for reading. I don't know many people that can successfully combine working, playing games, watching movies/tv shows with reading. Interactive media is too tempting and consumes our time for other hobbies which I'm ok with. I don't want to stop playing games or to stop watching movies/tv series. I just feel lonely in this journey, but for the last 12-13 months I've become really good in reading. I haven't had any  reading slumps and I haven't had any ""bad books"". I find reading really fun for the first time in my life. I've read good books before which I really enjoyed, but it's always been like a chore. For the last year I've had a couple days where I went to bed at 2am instead of 4am to read 2 more hours (until 6am). In other words I've had days where I felt that reading is better than games or movies. I've felt this need of reading when I was reading Wise Man's Fear, Shadows of Self and Words of Radiance. I was so invested in these 3. I always love sequels more. I'm currently struggling a little with Oathbringer and started reading Relic by Preston&amp;Child and I'm having a blast. The writing style is not the best I've read, but the story is so cinematic-like. There are cheasy 1-2-page chapters of a random character being killed by the murderer like it is a movie. But I love the suspense and the mystery. I'm exactly at 50% of the book and I can't wait to finish Relic and get back to Oathbringer. I don't feel this like a reading slump, just a little burned out (I've been reading Cosmere since December 25 2019 until now without reading anything outside it), but I'm still really invested and I love it.

I'd love to read your stories, thoughts and experience with handling work, family, movies, tv, games and other hobbies while reading books.","How do you find time to read without quitting other hobbies? A story about how I did it, but what about you?",1598792966

books,"I’ve only read two Stephen King books so far, but if **11/22/63** isn’t considered one of his best, I don’t really know what else to say. I was immensely moved by this book, and would recommend it to almost anyone. 

The first thing that has to be mentioned is the setting. Even after only two books, I can tell you that King is an absolute master at building places that feel real and lived in. In the case of **11/22/63**, he takes it one step further by transporting us to a real place in history, and it absolutely works. I was not alive in 1963 (hell, my *parents* were only three), but I feel like I’ve been there. This clearly took an immense amount of research, and it shows. 

Realistic worlds are really not worth much, though, if they are not inhabited by interesting characters. I really thought King excelled, here, too. Jake is a likable and relatable protagonist facing multiple impossible scenarios. Sadie is a woman the reader can’t help but fall in love with (though I wasn’t crazy about the audiobook narrator’s voice for her), and of course we get so much insight into one of the most infamous villains in US History - Lee Harvey Oswald. There are many memorable side characters as well, both historical and fictional (including unforgettable cameos by a few King characters from other novels). 

The story is also gripping, aside from a few moments of poor pacing (the reason it took me two months to finish instead of two days). The ending* was so good, however, that I am willing to forgive a few moments of slowness. The book also has more than a few surprisingly beautiful turns of prose, and the time travel element was handled very well. 

Overall, I give **11/22/63** an easy 5 Stars, and recommend it to anyone that loves a great story.

books,"Last week, my father and I purchased Stephen King's IT so that we could read it at the same time and then discuss it afterwards.

For context, I am seventeen years old and I'm a big fan of the horror genre.

I have read countless horror stories – Lovecraft's work, nosleep stories, and creepypastas – and I seldom got scared.

After reading 400 pages, I officially declare that IT is my favorite book of all time.

My father, on the other hand, stopped reading after 200 pages as he personally found it ""too graphic"", and he didn't like the ""overly sexual"" scenes.

And then he came to me and told me to hand him my book. Now, I have a good relationship with him and while he never forbade me from continuing, he gave me the ""I trust that you'll listen to my word and not defy me"".

I told him that I didn't take the language seriously and I was content with the creepy atmosphere depicted in the book, but he refused to listen and told me that I'll understand (and thank him) someday in the future.

I don't want to defy my parents but how do I convince them that I'm no longer a child and horror novels – whether they're graphic or not – are my favorite novels to read. Well, maybe even convince them, at the very least, to just let me finish the novel, especially considering the fact that I reached an extremely engaging chapter.

books,"First of all, I'd just like to thank this community because I got some fantastic insights last time I was here. The views expressed played a major part in me amending how I approach my work as a video producer for the publishing industry.   
The general consensus was that everyone thought book trailers were dumb and pointless. It confirmed a lot of what I already thought to be true. It seems the general approach to book trailers is anti-marketing.   
I wish I could show you my work on commercials to give you a better context but I don't want this post to be mistaken as a sneaky marketing ploy and be pulled down so instead, I'm going to tell you my new approach to producing a commercial for fiction novels and hopefully gather your thoughts.   
\*\*\*  
1) Where I used to cast actors, I've opted not to portray any main characters in my commercials from now on because I feel that it destroys the world-building for readers.   
2) My commercial spots are now a lot shorter and digestible. When I first began, authors would request commercials that were 1-3 minutes long, and by virtue of this, the video would end up giving away too much of the story.   
3) The style of my adverts is now more abstract and I no longer make commercial spots that depict literal scenes from the book. Again, I feel it destroys world-building for the reader.  
And finally, a question about something I still do:  While I've eliminated the use of actors portraying main characters on screen, I still hire voice actors to narrate the spots, usually an extract from the book. I have them read in character if the story is told in first-person. My logic for this is that generally, people don't seem to mind audiobooks, but as readers, would you find this element distracting? Would you carry the voice you heard in the commercial into your own reading of the book, and would this bother you?

It's either young adult or middle grade. Two kids, friends or siblings (probably friends). It involved Norse runes, but could be druid or just runes in general. There were portals drawn by runes to create the door to somewhere. Parts of it takes place at a school.

books,"Did this back when i was in 8th grade, while someone kept me cover at the door of an empty class room.. All computers shut down, even teachers, office computers, EVERY COMPUTER.. I was like oh shit it worked &amp; I looked at my friend and gave him a thumbs up.. Afterwords we ran from the scene &amp; I shit you not, 2 minutes into walking away and laughing, over on the loud speaker was our principal claiming a lockdown &amp; that it was not a test.. My heart went straight down to my ass.. We managed to walk into a class of different student we didn’t know. While waiting, everyone was scared &amp; curious on wtf was going on. We heard sirens of cops just outside the window of the class room.. That’s when i literally knew, they’re here for me lol. They go searching the school with K9 DOGS ! And about 10-15 officers. School was on lockdown for about almost 2 hours. The only thing that made me feel good was that I had lunch during the time I committed my experiment, and there is no attendance to lunch. They called off the lockdown &amp; I felt relieved ! But there was still cops posted in front of my school and some inside our main office.. Come last period, the cops were still here &amp; I couldn’t wait to run and hop on my bus to leave home. As soon as I look at my phone to see what time it was, I heard my name and my friends name called upon over the loud speaker by our principal.. There goes that heart leaving my ass feeling again.. I get to the office &amp; about 4 cops were just standing there with our principal, they told us to sit inside the principals office &amp; wait there. Me and my friend, literally scared &amp; knew it was only a matter of time until they fuck us over lol. Our principal enters his office with about 4 cops. He cleared his throat and got straight to it.. He knew we were up to no good &amp; he stated he saw us inside a class room through security cameras... I totally forgot about the fucking cameras lmao. He asked what we were doing &amp; as soon as I was going to admit to hacking all the computers, my friend bursts out saying, we were trying to enter a porn website &amp; got afraid we’d get caught so we ran.. 1 week suspension for inappropriate behavior. My friend literally saved our asses, we could’ve been in deeper shit, since our school was surrounded with cops and K9s.. Til this day they still don’t know who did it.. 3 years later, after I graduated from middle school, my little brother goes there now and he always tells me a story that rumored around that school &amp; he explains, one day a demon came into the school and shut down all the computers.... &amp; I laughed silently.. Knowing it was just me and my dumbass friend :)",? How I got suspended for hacking my school computers,1598775879
books,"Basically I've postponed starting reading Pratchett for a while now and it's kind of time to do so.

The question is where do I start and what would be a recommended order to read his stuff?

Obviously I've heard about Discworld but it's my understanding that it's a bit similar to Asimov's Foundation i.e. a LOT of books that were written in a different order than the action happened chronologically - I am a bit unsure I'm making sense here, English isn't my first language.
