I am currently in the process of writing my Diploma thesis (or at least coming up with a topic). I happen to have a chance of getting data (what exactly has not been specified yet, I need to have a good business case to receive anything) from a network of medical clinics that specialize in biological therapy (think multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.). I believe this could be an opportunity to use my obtained skills for something that is actually good and might have some impact. I am majoring in Economics but I specialize in Econometrics and Data Science. 

Now, I do have some ideas of what to do but I would like to ask whether anyone here has any tips on what kind of data I can utilize and what are my possibilities regarding the research focus.

datascience,"I've gone through several iterations of writing a blog focused on data science and could use some feedback on an approach that fits my needs. I've seen very little resources out there that focus on this workflow so I hope it's useful for others here. 

TLDR existing workflow: 

- Plumber API (R backend) hosted on Heroku for free and serves summary data for different articles
- Works but not scalable, will re-run analysis code whenever data is requested by frontend
- Frontend built with React and hosted for free on Netlify that fetches from Plumber API

TLDR requirements in new workflow: 

- Ideally any analysis code written in R to serve dynamic output data to frontend
- Frontend built with no restrictions on layout (React / Vue)
- Scalable backend analysis that can quickly transfer data to frontend  

I'm most comfortable using R (especially for data processing/analysis) so I started with a Blogdown website but it wouldn't be uncommon for some articles I wrote to take ~1 minute to load because of the charts and maps I would use. I did what I could to optimize this but ultimately accepted there are better solutions out there. I now have any analysis underlying a blog post hosted as a Plumber API. This usually involves requesting data from a third party API, processing, and then serving summary output that is then charted on the frontend. This is not ideal because of how long some processes can take to run (especially if multiple users are requesting at once since R is single-threaded). I've built the backend to be wrapped in a Docker container so it could technically be hosted as multiple instances with Kubernetes but this seems like overengineering.

Ultimately what I think is missing is a hosted database that output data is stored in to be served to the frontend. I've toyed with the idea of a serverless architecture to run my analysis code (once a week, month, etc.)  and then store the output to a Db. I have no experience with serverless so I don't know whether this is overengineering as well. I know it is technically possible to write serverless Lambda functions in R but don't know if there are any disadvantages to this approach.

We get open ended responses to several questions on every survey and I'd like to categorize individual responses into themes and pull out 3 or 4 representative quotes for the top few themes. With average around 5 open end questions per survey and \~2500 respondents I'm looking at maybe 10,000 individual responses a month. This is still in development so is currently being done by hand (!!!) every month (not by me thank god).

I have a shell of a program built that pulls word frequencies across each response set, then uses some human input and intuition to develop a code frame, and then pulls a random set of the top 20 longest quotes from my specified code frames. Obviously the problem is using just words, or even bigrams, the longest quotes are going to end up with several categorizations and it still takes reading through to accurately put them into their correct bucket.

What I think I'm leaning towards is building a training set with all these labeled instances and specifying a set code frame that's used over and over. I lose some of the nuisance associated with specific trends in the responses but that's the only way I can see to fully automate this.

datascience,"Let me elaborate. 

I want to take a time step (containing amplitudes of various frequencies at each time step) and feed it into a feed forward network. Then i want to reconvert it into audio.

I took a .wav audio file and made it into a spectrogram S[T][f] where there are T (5511)  time steps. Each time step comtains a vector of 101 elements i am using. The order of elements are te order of frequencies i am using and the value of each element is its amplitude.

How can i use this data (data: the amplitudes of each frequency at each time step with 44000 sampling rate) into audio data (.wav or any other format)?

If it is not possible to do this, please suggest how can i process audio data and write audio data into a file. What is the format to be used?","How to convert spectrogram into audio data, or how to write audio data?",1586346847

datascience,"I am a data scientist/ML engineer trying to get to know different  angles for looking at my profession, especially how it may affect people  with other background.

In the last years I read some books, but probably they're biased  (being written by people who did it professionally, at least at some  point)  


* *Master Algorithm* by Domingos (good book, but it's sort of popular science on ML and the social aspect part is very weak IMO, because it is full of hype and reads more like a sales pitch than result of some analysis) 
* *Weapons of Math Destruction* by O'Neill - it touches some relevant points. I'm not sure about the validity given O'Neill's track record though - she once lamented how no one does research on AI fairness (this was in a newspaper article, it was not long ago, when there were established programs and research groups on that). Also book is very political and might sometimes be annoying if you don't exactly lean left 
* *Outnumbered* by David Sumpter - this is by far the best book I've read, it's well balanced, like for example the author mentions different metrics that were used to assume whether algorithms made racist predictions or not. Also he doesn't push any ML hype, and actually finds there is no proof for some results that got huge media coverage.
* *Architects of Intelligence* \- it's a set of interviews with ML people. What is great about it is that you can see that there is no consensus on the future of the field, and that people who actually have impact have divergent opinions on some topics (like for example on regulation)

I'm looking for books preferably written by specialists (as opposed to journalists), also maybe if this becomes a big list someone will find it helpful.

datascience,"Hello everybody,

I am thinking about getting a Smartwatch or Fitness Tracker and the corresponding app. But I have two requirement this device should fulfill (which is why I am asking in this subreddit):

1. All recorded data can easily be exported to a format I can analyse myself (e.g. CSV)
2. The app and connected are provided by a ""trusted"" provider having high privacy standards

It would obviously also be nice if the data presentation and analysis provided by the app itself is already as neat as possible.

Do you guys have any suggestions? What is your personal experience? I am an iPhone User by the way, so the Apple Watch is an option.

Hi there,

I'm doing a research paper in the area of behavioural economics with the title 'The Relationship between Conscientiousness and Individual Level of Loss Aversion moderated by Emotional Regulation'. It consist of 3 questionnaires a) IPIP Conscientiousness Scale, b) Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and c) A lottery Choice Task. This questionnaire will take approximately 7-10 minutes.

datascience,"Hey together,

I studied a technical specialization of psychology and always loved the planning, conducting and analyzing of psychological studies. I loved working with the data and loved applying them to current questions. That's why I focused on User Experience.

Currently almost every job I see in this field is either strong in programming or design. Pure research positions are fairly rare. I looked into further trainings to go more into data science and maybe work self employed at some point. In that direction I mostly find Big Data and very technical sources. I came to the conclusion that I should learn Python but \~120 pages into ""Automate The Boring Stuff With Python"" I don't really see the big picture.

Do you have any recommendations on what I could get into to prepare me for a job that analyzes customer data and make implications for others? Will that always bring me to ""big data"" and makes Python necessary for it?

I have the following questions:

1. Do you think that attending in my university a course in ""Information Theory"" could be a great idea? Or is it a course far from my personal goals?

2)What are your opinions about the following Stanford course related to Statistical Learning: [https://online.stanford.edu/courses/sohs-ystatslearning-statistical-learning](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/sohs-ystatslearning-statistical-learning)
