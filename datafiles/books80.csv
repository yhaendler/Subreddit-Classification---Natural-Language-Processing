books,"This was the first of Richard Matheson's novels that I have read. I was mostly drawn to it for it's unique concept and I was not disappointed in the unusual story of Scott Carey. I usually search reddit to read discussions others have had about books whether it's about the ending or the content as a whole, but didn't find anything for this title. I mostly wanted to discuss the underlying plot about Scott's struggle with masculinity. That to me was a clear metaphor for the story but I'd love to hear others thoughts on the subject, and also the ending!

books,"It comes as no surprise that Agatha Christie has yet again managed to make a reader's jaw drop to the ground with her endless well of cleverness and ingenuity. I mean this novel is nothing short of brilliant! 

This novel follows our favourite French (ahem Belgian) detective Monsieur Hercule Poirot who along with Arthur Hastings (our narrator) and others must deal with a serial killer murdering according to alphabet. 

This novel has this unique narrative style which combines first person and third person, which helps give the story a lot more layers and depth as we see the perspective of several people. 

Hercule Poirot is alot more unsettled in the book, which is something I haven't really seen before in the other books i have read  with his character. This is because of the letters (I won't go any further to avoid spoiling anyone.) In addition to that the murders themselves are complicated and much more convoluted which justifies our ever-confident detective's unnerving manner in this particular story. 

The final few pages are page-turners as one would expect from a Christie novel. I cannot for the life of me see anyone guessing correctly on who the murderer is. If you do, *mon ami*, you have exercised your little grey cells well. The ending is superb as always and am left shocked by the ingenuity of it all! 

Final thoughts: this book wowed me and I cannot be any gladder for picking it up. Its one of Christie's more complex novels (out of the five I've read so far) with its psychological themes and sombre tone. I highly recommend. 


And if you're curious here are the five books I've read by Christie so far:

- Death on the Nile

- I prefer Campbell as ""key"" book for FW to Bishop Book of Darkness. I don't like many of Skeleton Keys thoughts but still in many places I thought it was nearly great.  
- Use finwake.com  
- Oxfords edition is the perfect one for reading, Vikings Hardback (with all authors notes embodied) is the perfect one for collection.  
- It has plot and there is no gibberish at all in it.  
- Just tackle through first 4 chapters.  
-  Don't try translated variants (Eng is not my 1st language but still DON'T). As an example- Joyce was controling french translation of FW and he really prefered books sense being totally changed in favor of keeping its flow musical.

books,"Hey all, I just started a new job in which I am able to listen to a lot of books and I have been going through books left and right. I try to save these audiobooks for on my commute and for my breaks and they offer great relief from the ten-hour night shifts (well sort of night shift it's from 16:00-02:30). I thought it would be a good idea to catalog the works I read each month and if anyone has read these books and wants to discuss them that would be pretty cool too.

&amp;#x200B;

For the month of January, I read (listened) to:

""The Ball and the Cross"" by G.K. Chesterton-a zealous Catholic and a zealous Athiest decide to have a duel to the death while the rest of the world tries to stop them and an issuing friendship occurs. A really funny and witty book that gets a little weird towards the end, I think it's a great example of the journey being better than the destination. It also shows that people with two very different worldviews can still be friends, something I think is much needed in today's political climate (if you are from the USA).

&amp;#x200B;

""The Moviegoer"" by Walker Percy-a fascinating read about a man trying to find meaning in life and confronted with two paths, his mother's Catholic life and his Aunt's understanding of Southern principles. Being dissatisfied with both he sets out to find his own meaning. This book gave me a lot to think about and was pretty entertaining. Percy is an interesting author who gives his reader a lot to chew on. 

&amp;#x200B;

""The Hobbit"" by J.R.R. Tolkein- what more can I say, it's Tolkein, and reading ""The Hobbit"" for the first time was a lot of fun. Though the audiobook that I got was one that was adapted for radio so the voice acting was okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Love in the Ruins"" by Walker Percy-Another Percy book and this one was really funny and had some interesting insights into the world we live in today. He paints a dystopian world in which everyone is sharply divided and in the middle of things lays our protagonist who is developing a machine that measures the soul of an individual all while trying to maintain two relationships with two different women. 

&amp;#x200B;

""The Pearl"" by John Steinbeck-Like many on this sub, ""East of Eden"" changed my life, and I thoroughly enjoy his other works, this is no exception. I quaint folktale is elevated with the imagery of music and the various types of song that surrounds the family. A quick read and an enjoyable one as well with a great climax. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Frankenstein"" by Mary Shelley-this was a book that I ""read"" in high school, and while I remembered a lot of the parts in the book, I gained a new appreciation for the story and got very invested in the two main characters and their struggles. I thought the ending left a lot to think about but I won't spoil anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Say Nothing"" by  Patrick Radden Keefe -This was recommended by a coworker of mine and oh my gosh was this fascinating. A mixture of history, investigative journalism, and mystery, Patrick Radden Keefe takes the reader on an incredible journey to the not so distant past and explores life in Northern Ireland and the conflict between the IRA and the Loyalists and centers on the disappearance of a middle-aged widow of ten children. I want to talk more about this as this might be the best book I've read all year, and I might make another post here discussing this book. I highly recommend picking it up!

books,"First off, apologies for that awful title, I really couldn't think of anything better. Also, major spoiler warning for the novel *1984* by George Orwell.

In the book, it's said multiple times that Newspeak is expected to be the sole language in use in Oceania by Party members. Proles, as seen in the conversation between Syme and Winston Smith, are of course exempt from this expectation.

The whole point of employing Newspeak as a language is to make *crimethink* (Or thoughtcrime in Oldspeak) nearly impossible, except for in vague ways such as the sentence, ""BB is ungood.""

**-- --**

If we're to assume that Winston Smith's memory serves, Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were arrested in 1965, some of the few (temporary) survivors of the middle Sixties, during the ""great purges in which the original leaders of the Revolution were wiped out once and for all.""

A passage from pages 66 - 67 in one of my copies reads, ""As often happened, they had vanished for a year or more, so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way. They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various trusted Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother which had started long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people."" 

It then goes on to say, ""All three had written long, abject articles in the *Times* analyzing the reasons for their defection and promising to makes amends.""

This made me wonder, **after the year 2050, how would this be possible?**

The words *crimethink, oldthink* and perhaps an adjective like *doubleplusungood* could be used. Since we know the words *goodthink, goodthinking, goodthinker,* and *goodthinkwise* exist, it's reasonable to assume that their counterparts, *ungoodthink, ungoodthinking, ungoodthinker, ungoodthinkwise* would exist as well. Words like that could be applied to this situation. 

However, in the appendix of the novel, there is a passage that reads, ""Countless other words such as *honor, justice, morality, internationalism, democracy, science* and *religion* had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket words covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. All words grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for instance, were contained in the single word *crimethink,* while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word *oldthink*. Greater precision would have been dangerous.""

The sentences, ""We supported equality."" or ""We didn't support Big Brother."" are pretty simple in Oldspeak. In Newspeak, it would be possible to say. You would have to instead render the entire thing into the word *crimethink* or something similar.

Depending on whether or not the Party decides to keep in words such as ""embezzlement"" or ""sabotage"" or even the word ""murder"" - (because murder is typically used to have a more emotional and negative connotation, almost solely in use in reference to the purposeful killing of a human being, and it's also a synonym for *kill,* and the Party is cutting down on synonyms for Newspeak. Maybe they wouldn't even keep in the word *kill*, and instead opt for something like *unlife*.) - **would the detailed confession of crimes and analysis of it being committed be something that could happen in Newspeak?**",How would a public execution/prosecution work in the 1984 universe after the year 2050?,1612452221

It's a dark, mature fantasy story with fantastic world building and exposition, with a hard-ish magic system. Pacing is very good, characters are pretty consistents and the plot makes me wainting new chapters like a starving man, which are luckily pretty beefy and currently published every weeks.

It's violent, original, and underrated. It's terrific.

I found this book to be average. The story was let's say too plain and linear.
