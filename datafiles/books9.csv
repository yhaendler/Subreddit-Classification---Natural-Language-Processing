&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for books of fiction (novels or short stories) with a very small sized binding that will literally fit in my pocket.

&amp;#x200B;

It is okay if it is leather bound or a very old print but it should be readable. My goal is NOT to collect it but to actually read it.

A good example would be something that is about 5 inches long and 3.5 inches wide. It's okay if the text is very small and the pages thin (think Bible).

Are there any books today that are published this way? Or is there a marketplace that sells books in this size? What are my options, Reddit?

I went into this trying to put aside any of my preconceived notions about Dan Brown and his writing. You guys... I really wanted to like this book. 

First, what I liked: the story was entertaining! The action was exciting, and the fast pace of it really kept my attention on what was happening.

Now, what I didn't like: most everything else.

The writing left a lot to be desired; a more notable quote being ""Houdini did yoga""... this was said by the female character, Vittoria, after what could've been an impressive feat. But, having her say that after what doing something impressive made it seem really trivial and silly. Speaking of Vittoria, I don't think Dan Brown has ever met or spoken to a woman. She was written so badly. Everything she did was amazing, for a woman. She's supposed to be this really smart scientist, yet for some reason Robert Langdon is always completely surprised when she comes up with a good idea. 

Another thing that got to me, and I'm not sure if it's due to the book being 20 years old or if it's just me, but the Illuminati was a major thing in the book and I just could not take it seriously. The Illuminati is just sort of a joke for me, and it was just very odd seeing these people's reactions to it in the book. They had either never heard of it somehow, or they only knew if it from a popular video game. On a similar note, it was also odd to me that no one had heard of anti-matter either. Like I can understand not knowing exactly what it is, but these educated people had never even heard of it. How?? 

My last gripe is the whole thing with the ambigrams. An ambigram is a word, art form or other symbolic representation whose elements retain meaning when viewed or interpreted from a different direction, perspective, or orientation. This book made it seem like making an ambigram out of the world ""Illuminati"", and a few other words is like humanly impossible. If you went to pretty much any tattoo shop they could probably make one for you in like an hour... they're not that hard Robert Langdon.

So yeah... overall enjoyed the story but had a lot of issues with the writing. I'm still going to try to read The Davinci Code, we'll see if that goes any better for me!",Angels and Demons... my review,1581284578

books,"Hello everyone,

I feel myself inclined to share this with you due to the extremely positive experience I've had with the Tolino Shine 3, which is a german version of the Kobo Clara HD, sporting exactly the same specs, hardware and features, their difference being more on the stores they're connected with. 

I've had a kindle ever since they came out. I remember my big ass keyboard kindle with fondness. I learned to love ereaders with it, and I stuck to kindles all the way up to the paperwhite 4. In between, I tried other ereaders and found them lacking mostly due to the frontlight issues they had and the slowness, but it seems those times are now past and we have proper contenders in the ereaders market.

The best ereader I've had before the Tolino Shine 3 was the paperwhite 2. I liked it because it had a good light for its time, was snappy, easy to use, and the bezzles didn't reflect. I upgraded to the paperwhite 4 thinking what's good can only get better, and gifted my PW2 to my daughter.

Oh, how I missed the PW2... 

The paperwhite 4 is a great ereader, but I found myself dealing with some annoyances that put me off of it.

1. The bezzles reflect light, making it very uncomfortable to read in the train or daylight. Having to turn the reader in this or that angle in order to avoid the light being annoying made me eventually just leave it at home and read paperbacks instead.

2. The bezzles were huge yet uncomfortable. It's a tall reader but I don't grab it by the top or buttom, rather by the side, where it's thinnest.

3. The power on/off button sticks out a bit, enough so that if I mistakenly hold the reader from the bottom or let it rest on my stomach while laying down reading, it turns off... That was annoying and made me paranoid of how I was holding it.

4. It is heavy. Heavy enough that I have to switch hands while reading.

5. It is big, it doesn't fit in my pocket and I can't sneak off to the bathroom to read 2-3 pages without it being obvious.

6. It doesn't have a warmlight feature. For that I'd have to get the Oasis 3, which is even bigger. The thought of such a simple feature not being available in this most standards of amazon readers made me feel forced to unnecessarily upgrade in order to get the feature if I wanted to stay within the ecosystem.

7. The screen is at the same level of the bezzles, which makes it feel like a tablet.

Now, after some research, I decided to give the Kobo a try, but I live in Austria so getting a Kobo felt shady since I had to order and wait a few weeks ever since it pulled off the german market. I researched why this was so hard and found out that the company is somewhat merged with the Tolino company, and these are the equivalent readers for the german market. I compared specs and saw they were basically clones off each other. Perfect. 

I had the chance to go to the bookstore and play with it for a while, and before even buying it I noticed:

1. It was lighter.
2. It had a warmlight feature.
3. It felt snappy and fast.
4. It read epubs.
5. It can connect to my local library and dozens of other stores in a sort of a german alliance.
6. The power button is wider, but its a bit sunken in so you have to use a nail to press it, which is perfect for me because I won't accidentally turn it off.
7. The screen was a bit deeper than the bezzles, creating a more classic ereader device than a tablet.

I took it home confidently and played with it. 

At home, I set it up and made a list of the authors and books I wanted to read. I organized all the ebooks in folders locally and then connected the ereader, transfered the folders, and turned on my ereader.

My first surprise: all the folders are configured as collections within my ereader, which makes that much less of a hassle to organize.

My second surprise: I had dictionaries to define and translate to, from, and in 8 different languages, which is fantastic for me since I read in four different ones.

My third surprise: it fits into my pocket

My fourth surprise: the bezzles do not reflect light. It is VERY comfortable to read. 

My fifth surprise: the sensor that adapts the warmth and brightness of the light to my atmosphere works fantastically. 

I am incredibly pleased with this device and just had to share my experience because it's been quite a long time since I've been so pleased with something beyond kindles. We've come a long way in the topic of options for the public and I think that's a good thing. In terms of limitations, I can think of none beyond being able to read samples immediately on the kindle since it has 3g, but that's something I can live without and is far outweighted by the benefits of this little beauty.

Anyhow, I'm sure I've missed some things but these are the points that come to mind at the time of writing. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

So if you are on the fence about buying an ereader, or wanting to try something other than kindles, please consider either the Tolino Shine 3 in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland, or go for the Kobo Clara HD in other parts of the world if you're anywhere else. 

They are truly a beautiful, comfortable, and immersive experience in reading! I can literally forget WHERE I'm reading the book in and focus more on the reading itself.

I'm thinking about just taking a break whenever there's a natural pause in the scene or whenever there is a change of pace in the chapter. For example, sometimes a new paragraph will change the scene without providing a break in the chapter, so I might stop there and take a break then continue reading later.

books,"In many ways, Doug Brunell's book is a character study. Although the narrator makes it clear at the outset that he is unreliable because the written word itself is a lie, he promises that his third or fourth version of the story is accurate, self-incriminating and brutal. Written from the perspective of Dan, a true crime author who rescued a 15 year old from a child sex trafficking ring and profited off of her story and his heroism, the novel follows his attempts to write the second of three books under the contract with his publisher. At the outset, he promises that there will not be a third book. And by the end, you know why.

I read this book in less than a day. It is compelling, in the way any downward spiral or accident can be compelling. What sets it apart from a run of the mill effort at a suspenseful thriller, however, is the character study of Dan. Dan's journey into the sex trafficking/child pornography world that inspired his first book has left him divorced, single and potentially unstable. Early on in the story, after he meets and integrates his life with Martin's, we learn that his act of heroism had a very dark side that culminated in sexual violence. Dan's exterior self is a facade, and he has not used therapy or personal disclosure to reveal what he did to any others, to seek help. Maybe because he likes it, and is thrilled by it.

Brunell has raised some interesting questions about male sexuality here. Whether the result of biological, psychological or social forces, or some mix of all of them, male sexuality, in its own way, has been as feared and repressed as the female variety. The quip that rape, sexual harassment or other forms of sexual violence are about power ignores the very potent way that power dynamics have been part of sexual expression for all of human history. Martin's brutal takedown of fetish BDSM culture also reveals the inherent problem behind our attempts to sublimate these sexually violent urges in various directions: BDSM is performative. The participants use ""toys"" to ""play"" with one another, complete with magic words that operate to ensure the safety of the game. But how do you ensure a sexually egalitarian world if male sexuality has an inherently brutal edge? Rape ""fantasies"" abound in men and women, according to available psychological studies and literature. And increasingly, neurological studies reveal that sex and violence share some of the same circuits.

The story of Dan and Martin is an extreme case, although there are plenty of non-fictional parallel stories. But Dan's dark descent raises some disturbing questions about our failure to confront the link between human arousal and human brutality. And also, implicitly, to confront the link between our lurid fascination with true crime depictions of sexual violence and the possibility of some deeper desire to have insight into it on a more visceral level. Some of the writing here is as dark as anything that Peter Sotos has written. That's an accomplishment in and of itself.

You will feel things reading this novel. Many of them will be unpleasant feelings. And I can think of no higher compliment for a writer.

books,"I don't know how many of you read French literature (in the original or otherwise), but I find Anglophone literature way ahead of French, like by 100 years. Modern and postmodern lit really took off in America and Britain, but this hasn't really been the case for French literature as far as I'm aware. On the whole, it seems stuck in realism and littérature engagée, wherein some essay-length (or shorter) political message has been fluffed up to book length, without any regard for the aesthetics of the text, literary device, or deeper meaning. Granted, there are some exceptions, notably Boris Vian and Samuel Beckett (an Irishman), but there's no equivalent to English-speaking postmodern authors. Nor is there a literary equivalent to Jean-Luc Goddard, though that comparison is unfair as he was a film genius, and avant-garde kinda died out anyway.

This isn't a new trend either. Marlowe and Shakespeare were ignoring unity of time well before French playwrights would dare do the same, and English authors arguably developed the novel earlier, or at least the popular one with Pilgrim's Progress.

I would love to be proven wrong of course, but that's what I've observed. Now of course, French realism is only outdone by Russian realism in my opinion, Balzac, Zola, and the numerous other namesakes of French streets were masters of their art. It's just that I am completely ignorant of any significant (post)modernist movements thereafter.",English literature more advanced than French,1581256676

books,My first time reading her. A Better Man is great winter reading.,Louise Penny,1581255929
books,"He was accused of murdering 4 of his close friends in a makeshift basement recording studio of a home belonging to the parents of one of the victims.  It was an old, well-to-do neighborhood in Dorchester, Massachusetts.  In fact, it was about 2 blocks away from the Dorchester Division of the Boston Municipal Court – where I would later sit as a judge.  A grand, colonial style house with a front and back yard, corner lot.  Looking at it, you would never imagine the horror that eventually took place within it.  From the street, you can see the steps that lead to the small, cramped, cluttered and filthy basement. By the time I first saw it, the home had already been sold.  It was after the murders.  A beautiful, well-kept, tree-lined Boston neighborhood.  

     I lived in Dorchester too at that time.  No more than 2 miles from the scene.  It shook the city.  People did not want to admit it, but part of the reason that their murders had such an effect on Boston was that they were not gang members, not drug dealers, not stick-up kids.  It shouldn’t have, but it hurt differently than the thousands of shootings that had become all too commonplace in this city.  And I passed by that house every time I handled a case at the Dorchester courthouse.  I knew it well.  Never once did I think that so close the center of justice for this neighborhood would such a vile act take place.

   The basement was dirty and smelled. For 19-21 year-old young aspiring hip hop artists though, it was a perfect hang out spot...

There were no eyewitnesses who testified. There were, however 60 odd witnesses willing to lend their part of the Commonwealth’s story to condemn my client. 

Every time I went to visit him at the jail, I ran across this foul odor at the facility. It hits you as you approach the building. Coming from the vents on the outside of the place. And it stays with you as you enter and sign in as a visitor. It stays with you when you are escorted to the elevator and to the room where you will eventually spend hours talking Tom your client. It stays with you until you walk out and away from the entire building. It is not a food smell. It is not body odor from those being detained. It smells like institution. It smells like building. It smells like institutionalized food. It smells like poverty. If each of those words had a smell and you combined them. That’s what Nashua Street Jail smells like. It is nauseating. And depressing.

So that is what I dealt with every time I went to visit this young man accused of four heinous murders. At no juncture was I ever bringing him good news. So, the entire experience was sad. It saddened me to no. end. But I went there more times than I can count to see him, to counsel him, to learn about the facts from him.",My Last Murder Trial,1581255412

books,"Both of these graphic novels surround a notable political conflict and bring to light a perspective that is difficult to thoroughly understand through the media. Persepolis (surrounding the Iranian revolution) and Maus (the Holocaust) both tell stories from the mouths of survivors/ victims of some of the most horrific moments in human history. Persepolis narrates the story of the author as she navigates an increasingly conservative society and authoritarian government with a mindset that is too progressive for its geography. It's an incredible exploration of young identity, revolution, feminism, and the middle east. Maus - which is brilliantly allegorical - tells the store of a Holocaust survivor, from pre-Nazi Germany to right before the book is published. When we read of these things, these events that shook the world and rocked us to our cores, we hear what we're supposed to. What we're allowed to. These books retell a chapter in history from different eyes; a POV that is so valuable but so underrepresented. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in books with historical backgrounds.

Turns out, not so harmless as his secret to staying youthful is taking photos of women and burying them around his property.

Seems like most books that I see in recommended lists are part of a large saga, and I don't want to get invested on something that will take many years to actually reach an ending (if it does). And the ones that did get to an ending eventually all seem to have lost steam by that point.

This happens a bit in Sci-fi as well (I'm curious about Dune but good God is that series intimidating) but I feel like that genre is more okay with simply doing a single one-off book.

So I come here to ask: Which sagas actually managed to stick the ending? And which ones were actually good all the way through and didn't have a couple of bad books along the way? Are you okay with reading just one or two books from a series and ignoring the rest?
