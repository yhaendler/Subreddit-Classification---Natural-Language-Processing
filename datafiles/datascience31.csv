datascience,"As we know, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is a very common procedure in the field. We use it mainly to find inconsistencies in the data, to uncover simple patterns that could alter our perceptions of what we are dealing with and to build insightful visualizations. I think we can all agree how this type of information can be critical. What I would like to do here, and I hope you bear with me, is to question what seems to me a overly optimistic application of this technique.

So, a little context. I've been working on a small consultant startup that leverage data science techniques to serve our costumers. As you can probably guess, most of our services involve helping our clients make sense of their data and extract useful information that can maximize their profits. 

In the project I'm in, for 3 months we have been doing EDA and communicating our results through Power Point presentations. Although sometimes we could find something that was potentially interesting, this experience left me questioning the value of EDA when applied in isolation. 

To explicit my argument, let's go through an example: suppose I have a database with 20 variables and my goal is to find ""something interesting"". What we usually do is trying to find correlations between these variables (be it in form of graphs of statistical tests). Suppose that I find a positive correlation between X and Y, though. What is this really saying to me? How is this accounting for confounding variables and how much variance is it capturing? My bosses don't seem to me very concerned with these questions and usually think the finding of a correlation is already an insightful thing to communicate. 

I have been trying to argument with them that no analysis could be detached from previsibility. If this variable is correlated with the outcome, but it isn't helping to predict it, then why are we so focused on it? My concerns are usually met with the same answers: ""it is important to visualize what is happening"", ""we are still exploring our data"". 

This makes me think that my approach (predictability in the first place) is kind of unusual in the field? It appears to me that EDA has became a branch of data science that is not connecting very well with everything and is becoming embedded in some other kind of rules? 

I would love to hear your opinions about it.",EDA revisited,1590864173

I posted this in /r/machinelearning as well, but I figured I'd post it here too because it appears to be more active. I am looking for advice in detecting manipulation in real time trading data in an online game.

Consider my hypothetical scenario:

- There exists an online hub where people can post the price they paid for items in a video game

- The vast majority of trades posted are legitimate; however there is a financial incentive for people to post fake data for the sake of manipulating the market. Let's assume that this is very rare.

- For the sake of simplicity, a trade consists of the following data:


  {
 
    ""time"": timestamp

    ""itemId"": number

    ""quantity"": number

    ""price"": number

    // was the trade a market buy or a market sell?

    ""buy"": boolean

  }


- Some items receive a lot of volume (thousands of trades per day) while others don't receive much volume at all (one or two trades per day, if any)

- There are varying degrees of manipulation, and obviously there is some tolerance for minor manipulation slipping through the cracks

Which made me come prideful and condescendent , which made me stay in a place where there is not math related careers. The closest I came is computer systems and even then the math there is...not that great (I have classmates that do not know how to use fractions) so I was really depressed because I really wanted a math related career.

So... uhm I was really depressed because I really love math and I read that data analyst is a career that requires high-level of math.

I work in a role that somewhat resembles data-scientist along-side many other disciplines and I almost exclusively use python.  
I'm writing a dashboard app in plotly-dash with the hopes of deploying to a client.  
It has lots of multi-select dropdown menus for filtering the data and displays graphs which update when the selections are changed.   


My issue is that the data-set the app is dealing with is roughly 25 columns, 12 filters and 1.5milion rows.  
The app is slow to say the least...  


Does anyone here know of a suitable framework for the development of webapps in python that can handle very large data-sets with some sort of ""speed""?

Will share my story but heavily changed to protect the guilty.  

I work(ed) in a safety field where people die based on decisions. We risk rate things, and use our limited resources to prioritise what we need to fix. For arguments sake, I have put this in the context of safety of vehicles.

Someone in another department came up with a subjective but otherwise understandable way of risk rating. Things  like 

* if there are seatbelts, subtract 1
* add the number of accidents in the last year
* if there is speed monitoring, subtract 1
* if no licence is required, add 2
* subtract 1 for every time they have been inspected  


As you can see, some of these were real numbers, some ordinal, some categorical and so on.

These numbers are added to give a final ""risk"" score for a vehicle. So far, so dodgy.

However, this total ""number"" was then ranked, and then multiplied by the number of passengers to give an overall value, which was then multiplied by the amount of safety dollars we had to spend to work out what we should do.

Needless to say, my mood quickly went from appalled to ""holy shit we need to never let anyone outside the organisation see how we do this...""",Worst example of data stupidity you have seen?,1590749773

datascience,"I work as an Analytics Manager and normally I don't really share with my colleagues the in depth details of my work because nobody is technical. They just know I use SQL and Python to spit out a report and that's all they really understand.

Recently I had an opportunity to do something interesting where I had a very skewed data set and was asked to make sense of it. I thought applying a log transformation to normalize the data as the distribution was extremely skewed and thought it would make the data easier to interpret and I was happy with the results.

My colleagues wanted to know how I arrived at my conclusion for my recommendation so I walked them through the process. I provided a high level overview, but they really wanted to get into the nitty gritty of exactly HOW I got to where I got. Again, I normally don't like to do this because they tend ask very detailed questions like ""Can you explain exactly how this works so I can understand?"" and it gets tough to explain certain things (e.g., I would say something like ""I got this raw data from the API"" but then it's followed up by a question like ""What is an API and why didn't you just use the vendor's dashboard? Why doesn't the vendor's interface provide the data? Why do you have to go through this step?"").

Well anyway I was explaining my logic and really tip toed around the stats by really trying to say essentially that I applied some logic that would more even distribute the data. I stupidly said the word ""log"" and it was over. Their faces froze for a good 10 seconds before someone spoke.

""I'm sorry..but what? What is log? Why do you need this log? I'm really confused. How am I suppose to explain this to the SVP? Can you just change it so you're indexing off the median or mean? This doesn't make any sense.""

I'm dead.

So guys, how do you avoid getting away with having to explain things by  not using technical jargon? I mean like I said, I normally just show people the output of my report and I don't get too many in depth questions about it, but when people really pry, it gets tough. I don't know how to avoid saying ""I ran a regression model"" because it freaks people out and they get upset because they don't understand it and want me to do something that is easier to interpret.

This feature has about a r=0.077 correlation with the outcome (measured from observed data in the training set).

I'm looking to do Multiple Imputation on the missing values and I gather that I basically need to do the following:

1. Choose a single imputation method with a random component (regression with random error term, regression with bootstrap samples, etc.), impute missing values x times to get x separate datasets
2. Do my analysis (build an ML model) x times to get x different sets of results (model parameters)
3. Average the results to get 1 set of model parameters

I was wondering if it would be okay if I just did step 1 and averaged the missing values into 1 complete dataset? I ask because this seems like it may not be worth the hassle for something with only a r=0.077 with the outcome, and coupled with missing values in other features I would end up with a lot of models if I chose this approach.

datascience,"Hi,  


New user here, but long time lurker. Long story short:  


I studied civil engineering and worked in construction abroad for about 4 years. I realized that this career path was not for me due to the lack of work/life balance but also because of moving every 2-3 years for new projects. I left my work and did a MSc in Logistics in the UK and ended up specializing in Business Analytics as I found the field quite interesting. Soon after I found work in a software company (logistics) and it is essentially glorified tech support and frontline testing. Tedious work, but the organisation has lots of potential and within a year or so I'll be in a consultant role due to my previous experience. I am currently learning python in my spare time and have developed a further interest in Data Science. Since it seems like a good field to get into I did some research and found a part-time MSc in Data Science that I could do while working full time. I already inquired and I meed the admission requirements even though I do not come from a computer science background. It will be tough, but I'm willing to grind it out if it will pay off later on.  


So, my question to those who are already in the field of data science is the following:

  
Do you think this would be a good move on my behalf? I have read a lot of mixed opinions where some stress that academic qualifications are important to get into the field while others suggest that experience in programming is more important. Since my math is already decent due to my undergrad studies, should I pursue this degree or should I just learn the programming part and tools in my own time and try to look for work/transition to such a role in my current company later on?  


Due to the career switch, I need to get on this new path sooner rather than later and so if the studies help me to finally transition in this career quicker, I'm happy to go through with it.

I'm looking for some advice on how to approach a project I'm working on. 

I have cell network/traffic data. The goal is to assess the quality of the cellphone traffic after cell towers have been upgraded. 

The data look something like this (I simplified it):



device_id | device_location | cell_tower_id | cell_tower_location | signal_strength | signal_quality | time | zip_code
---------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|----|--------
int | lat/lon | int | lat/lon | float | float | timestamp | int


Imagine I have five months of data: 

* January - data collection
* February - data collection
* March - **cell tower upgrades**
* April - data collection
* May - data collection

My objectives:

* Determine whether `signal_strength` and `signal_quality` improved on average after the upgrades
* Build a model that predicts `signal_strength` and `signal_quality` after cell tower upgrades in one zip code
* Extend the model to zip codes that do not have the cell tower upgrades yet, in order to predict how a potential upgrade would improve `signal_strength` and `signal_quality` in that zip code

My plan is to use Jan and Feb as training data, and then use April/May as test/validation (I know it's only a few months but due to the nature of cell phone data it's hundreds of millions of observations). 

My main questions are:

1. What type of model(s)are appropriate for this kind of problem? 
2. How do I incorporate location (I'm thinking device distant from cell tower?)
3. Are there any resources for approaching this kind of problem?
