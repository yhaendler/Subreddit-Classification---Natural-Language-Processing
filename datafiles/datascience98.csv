datascience,"1) often we are told that linear regression models with many beta coefficients are ""undesirable"" (e.g. 100 beta coefficients, 100 predictors) - in general, these models are said to be unstable, high variance and likely to perform poorly. Does anyone know why this is?

2) this is a common sense question: suppose you have 3 variables (1 response, 2 predictors). You make a plot of these 3 variables and you notice that the plot of this data is clearly NOT linear. Therefore, you would decide NOT to use a linear regression model. Is there any mathematical logic that shows why a linear regression model is unable to well represent non-linear data? For 3 variables, i guess you could show this visually - but for higher dimensional data, what is the mathematical justification used to understand why a linear model can not capture non linear data?

3) in the previous question, i asked if linear models are ""too rigid"" to capture non linear patterns. But what about the opposite? Suppose you take the same example with the 3 variables : 2 predictors and 1 response. This time you have new data and make a plot, and the data appears to have a strong linear patterns. In this example, if you had still chosen to use a non-linear model : has their been any mathematical research that examines the ability of a non-linear model to capture linear patterns? In this example, would a linear model have some advantage at recognizing and capturing linear patterns compared to a non-linear model? Or in general, are linear patterns completely within the domain of non-linear patterns and as such, non-linear models are not expected to have any disadvantages at recognizing linear patterns (compared to linear models)?

4) Are non-linear patterns more likely to occur in bigger datasets (more columns and more rows)? Could we not say that if there are more data points, there exist more geometric configurations that these data points can be arranged in -  making non-linear arrangements more probable?",Basic questions about linear regression,1620167182

I found this interesting paper over here, where the author argues that more complex algorithms (e.g. deep neural networks) do not always have significant advantages over simpler algorithms in the real world (hence the illusion). The author brings up many reasons as to why this can happen - some of the reasons are related to mathematics, others are related to experimental design. 

(Note: the author brings up a point here that I am not sure why this is true: ""Conversely, in
the two-class case, although few real data sets have
exactly linear decision surfaces, it is common to find
that the centroids of the predictor variable distributions
of the classes are different, so that a simple linear surface can do surprisingly well as an estimate of the true decision surface"" ...  

Why is it common  to find that the centroids of the predictor variable distributions are different? Why does this allow for a linear surface to estimate the true surface well?)

Here were the thoughts I had after reading this paper: This was paper was published in 2006, before the ""deep learning revolution"" (e.g. in 2012 when Convolution Neural Networks clearly outperformed humans at the imagenet competition). Is it possible that the results from this paper are somewhat irrelevant and outdated? Researchers, universities and companies (e.g. google, Facebook, Microsoft) have probably spent a billion dollars since 2006 on developing more and more complex machine learning models. Using common sense, many of these models have performed well enough so that more research will be done in the future. I agree that for certain problems, perhaps simpler models (e.g. linear regression, decision trees) can perform just as well as deep learning models ... but surely, there are many problems in the real world which require more complex models? Can an argument made as to why complex models are required, using concepts such as the VC Dimension (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_dimension)? Relating to problems such as the initial ""x-or perceptron"" problem - could we not say that big data (data with many columns and many rows) is less likely to be linearly sepperable (i.e. harder to ""shatter"" - shatter =  classify perfectly) compared to smaller datasets? Could we not say that if there are more data points, there exist more configurations that these data points can be arranged in -  making it less probable for them to be analyzed using a simpler model (the VC dimension of a simpler model is lower than the
VC dimension of a complex model) ? Does this fact alone somewhat justify the need to develop complex models?","[D] ""Classifier Technology and the Illusion of Progress"" (2006, Hand)",1620156790

datascience,"I have some college education but it’s very minimal. I’m 21 and dropped out at 19 due do health reasons— which fortunately have gotten better. I want to focus on education and getting a career again, and I am interested in learning data science. I have unlimited time to work on it since I’m not employed or attending school. Right now I have a path in mind but I want to know if I’m being realistic, and also what I can do to improve. 

I started wanting to learn programming/software development but I became interested in data science as I was learning. I have completed a Python 3 course and one called “Analyzing Financial Data with Python” after that. Now I’m working on a 35-week data science course on codecademy that claims it will prepare you for a job (which I am doubtful of). I also got a certificate for learning The Command Line/Bash Scripting and did a few other introductory courses for things like web scraping, data visualization, natural language processing, and blockchain w/ python. 

My resources have been codecademy courses, data camp, coding challenges with edabit and hackaday, khan academy (for math practice), and O’REILLY textbooks. 

I plan on learning SQL and I’m learning the basics of C++ currently but I might switch to something else that’s more relevant to data science (possibly R?) 

I want to build a portfolio. My first major project was writing a program for stock portfolio optimization but I haven’t done much else. I am particularly interested in machine learning/AI, so my next project goal is to build a simple chatbot on my own (and showcase some other nlp stuff as well). 

Right now I’m just learning and practicing and I realize that none of my certificates or scores mean anything, but I’d like to get to the point where I’m competent. In all honestly, I’m terrible at it right now, but I think I’m doing pretty well for a beginner at least (I started only about a month ago with very minimal previous programming knowledge...only a very basic understanding of JavaScript from khan academy lessons when I was 13/14 and a Visual Basic class from high school that I actually ended up dropping partway through since I already had more than enough credits to graduate— I couldn’t do anything with that so-called knowledge now). I have put in about 5-6 hours a day every day since... and plan on continuing to do so). 

I created a LinkedIn profile and took the skill assessment tests for python and and machine learning and scored in the top 15% on both, which felt good. 

Once I complete my current goals I want to do something more intensive so I can actually land a job in data science or something similar. If it’s absolutely necessary, I can get a traditional degree but I have also been looking into things like the lambda school data science bootcamp or IBM’s data science professional certification course. 

I’d like some advice... is there anything I should be doing that I haven’t mentioned? Or anything that I should be doing instead? Are my goals achievable— or am I being unrealistic? How long will it take me to learn enough to land an entry level position or internship? I am hoping I can do it by the end of the year if I continue to work at the same pace or higher. 

Also, another question I have (somewhat unrelated): I’ve heard that many positions are more inclined to hire female candidates to increase diversity (which could benefit me since I am a woman). Would you say there’s any truth to that?

Hi all,

I am the CMO of an ecommerce company and have a Shopify store. I have been working towards improving the way I go about presenting in our weekly advertising meetings. In the past I've listed out campaigns, the performance of key metrics, sales attributed from each platforms and then discussed budget based on the performance.

Recently, I have been trying to correlate our advertising campaigns with the percentage of sales related to specific advertising objectives. For instance, if we're spending 50% of our ad dollars promoting wedding products, what percentage of our products sold are wedding related?

This has been helpful but I want to take it a few steps further. I'd like to chart product sales week over week but I am struggling to figure out the best way to go about it. We have a handful of products which each have different designs / customization options. More specifically if one of our wedding products sold 30 times last week and only 12 times this week. I would like it to say the Product Name, the units sold, and then the percentage change from the previous week. The goal will be to use this data to monitor how certain products are selling and then make changes or not based on the data. For instance if a product is not selling and we think it could be due to visibility, we could test highlighting it on the homepage or other landing pages and see week over week if it preforms better. Does that make sense?

Does anyone have a better way that they track and analyze sales and marketing dollars?

datascience,"I have feeling that not many people are willing to admit - but ultimately, is a significant part of many data mining projects (e.g. checking data quality, parsing through data, etc.) still done manually? 

For example here is an example I just made up relating to Supervised NLP (Natural Language Processing) Classification : Suppose I have 1000 medical reports of patients, containing unstructured text made by a doctor during a hospital visit. For a given patient, each report contains all the text notes that the doctor made for that patient, for visits between 2010 and 2020. These reports make mention of the patients bio data (e.g. age, gender, medical history, etc.) and the details of the symptoms that the patient is experiencing over a long period of time (e.g. let's say that these reports are 2000 words on average). The problem is, different doctors have different styles of writing - each of these 1000 reports is different from another. If a human were to read the report, the human could figure out what happened to the patient - did the patient have a serious condition (let's call this ""class 1"") or a non-serious condition (let's call this ""class 0""). This is what we are interested in predicting for future patients based on the limited medical notes made by doctors for these future patients. 

The problem is - there is no clear and fast way (not that I know of) to take the 1000 medical reports that are available, and label each report as ""class 1"" or ""class 0"". For example, for ""class 0"" : one of the doctors could clearly write at the end of a report ""all medical tests were conducted and the results and were all negative"", and another doctor could end the report by saying ""the patient should seriously consider changing their lifestyle and eat healthier food. benign."" . 

In this example, how would someone assign labels to all these 1000 cases, without manually reading them and deciding if the information in the report corresponds to a ""serious condition"" or a ""non-serious condition""? I was thinking of using something like ""sentiment analysis"" to capture the ""mood"" of these reports, and use sentiment analysis a method to informally gauge if the tone of the report is ""dark"" (serious condition) or ""light"" (non serious condition). But I am not sure if this is the best way to approach this problem. Is there a way to do this without reading all the reports and manually deciding labels?

In the end - this is what I am interested in doing : suppose a new patient comes in and on the first visit, the doctor makes some quick notes (e.g. patient is male, 30 years old, 180 cm, 100 kg, non-smoker, frequently complains of chest pains, no high blood pressure, works a construction worker and takes daily medicine for acid reflex). Just based on these quick notes and the 1000 reports available (NOTE: I am trying to illustrate a point here, that the medical notes for the new patient and the 1000 reports DO NOT have the same format), can a researcher predict (supervised classification, e.g. decision tree) if this patient will have a ""serious"" or a ""non-serious"" condition?

PS: suppose the doctors have a very detailed medical encyclopedia on their computers - can this medical encyclopedia be used alongside the 1000 medical reports to improve the prediction results?",Inevitable Manual Work Required in Data Science Projects,1620111263

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, everyone!

I'm trying to gain a good bearing on what I can do to improve the scope on how to approach my project for the data mining final I have. My wife, who is fantastic at pointing out my flawed, can't really keep up with the coding aspects and finds it intimidating, but is telling me I have a hard time conceptually understanding what I need to do and while I've definitely made some improvements, I still have a way to go.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is transcript from the first part of my project, where it states our overall goal:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It is now time to start using everything you have learned in the first half of this class. The project for this course is to develop your own original analysis case study, and you will be working through and updating this project for the remainder of the term. The work you are doing on the Titanic case study in parallel is a guide for your original project, but you will need to adapt the analysis for your data/project.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first step is coming up with an idea – arguably one of the hardest steps! Identify an original business problem for your project. There are lots of ideas available online through Kaggle and other sources, but your idea should have a unique spin on it. The second step is locating your data. This can come from a variety of sources, e.g., Kaggle, your job, a website, API, etc. Feel free to reach out to your instructor if you are not sure if your idea and data are suitable.  
&gt;  
&gt;Begin Milestone 1 with a 250-500-word narrative describing an original idea for an analysis/model building business problem. Then, do a graphical analysis creating a minimum of four graphs. Label your graphs appropriately and explain/analyze the information provided by each graph. Keep in mind that your analysis may look very different from the Titanic tutorial graphical analysis. Write a short overview/conclusion of the insights gained from your graphical analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

The project I've been able to start was essentially pretending that I'm an Apple data scientist and we are looking at a dataset where reviews from Amazon are analyzed. I've been able to properly format it so I could do some sentiment analysis, which I also did. I've split it up into different keywords, such as those that talk about the battery, the screen, the audio, etc. and did a lot of time series, histograms, r-squared and similar things to describe how things are, how they have been, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I have another four weeks of this class and I feel antsy waiting until mid-week to know how to proceed, especially since another bit of work is expected to be submitted tonight.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts? Everything is appreciated. I really want to do well in this class and with this final. I also want to be able to, when I'm ready to start applying for positions to break into this field, that I could point to this assignment and feel proud about it. I'd like to be able to impress potential employers.","Data Mining Final, thoughts on how to expand my project.",1620094488

datascience,"So I’m looking for some friendly, constructive advice if anyone is willing to help!

I am currently an undergrad in the UK in my final year studying Economics at a top 5 university (if the latter even matters at all).

As life has went on, I have regretted my 17 year old decision more and more to pursue Economics over Computer Science.

Blinded by the finance industry, I have come to realise (at a worryingly late time) that my real interest lies in tech. I’m fascinated by data, and learning about new and innovative things happening within that space.

That has led me to looking into careers such as Data Science and Software Engineering more. 

As a grad, it seems as though most of these ‘Technology’ jobs require a CS degree, unfortunately. 

From my degree, I believe I have a fairly comprehensive understanding of mathematics and statistics which I understand is useful, but lack the actual ability to programme. 


[TL-DR]:

My questions to people are:

- Have any of you broken into DS and related fields from non-related degrees? If so, how? What advice would you have 

- Would I need to do a master’s and PhD in a related field to even be considered? 

- Frankly, am I out of luck at this point? I understand the industry is increasingly more competitive every year and naturally there’s an inclination to take people with CS degrees.

- Side question: do people think of exit strategies in tech? The same way many people do in finance? 
I.e: work a tough stint for a couple years before [ideally] joining a smaller investment vehicle for work/lifestyle balance etc etc.

datascience,"Has anyone ever come across the ""stochastic block model"" (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_block_model)? All in all, this seems like a community detection algorithm for graphs (i.e. network clustering). 

Does anyone know in which circumstances it would make more sense to use ""stochastic block models"" compared to community detection algorithms such as ""louvain clustering""?

Until now, I had only approached this problem from a classical ""community detection"" approach (e.g. Louvain Clustering, Newman-Girvan, etc.). I had a question - suppose you have a network graph (let's say our knowledge of the graph is purely unsupervised - all nodes are of the same ""type"", and edges are only of one type) : in what circumstances would it make more sense to perform classical community detection algorithms on this graph (e.g. Louvain) vs considering a stochastic block model? 

I was slightly confused by the idea of ""recovery"" - in the context of stochastic block models, ""recovery"" refers to the ability of the model to recover all true communities with high probability? If we don't know the true labels, is there a way to ""assess"" the quality of the recovery? 

is a ""block"" similar to a ""community""? Do stochastic block models provide higher interpertability than deep learning techniques? Is this because stochastic block models are able to provide measures of ""stability"" and ""uncertainty""?

We are doing a student project as part of our biology bachelor, collecting data about hand features and collecting additional data about other traits/factors which may or may not be correlate with those hand features. Now, the question is how to process that data. Are there some (free) genius programs which may do the work? Also are there ways to put in the data and get out usable graphs/charts/diagrams?

I could imagine something like: ""deviation of the norm (reg: hand features) correlated to traits/factor w, x, y and z"" Where you see a larger corelation between the deviation of the norm and, lets say, trait w and x which belong to the category of disease. And less correlation between deviation of the norm and trait y and z which belong to the category of character traits. 

In one I'd like to depict the correlation between the single factors (w,x,y,z) and in a second graph the correlation between the categories (disease, character traits).

This is just an example. In reality there will be much much more traits and categories to connect. Also using different groups: male, female and male+female. So, this is going to be a huge mess. That's why I'm looking for a program and/or some advice.

datascience,"Hi everyone! I'm new to this group and am looking for some advice on data science masters programs. 

I majored in Neuroscience for undergrad and took the basic math/stats classes required for med school but have never taken a cs/data sci course or linear alegbra. I really want to pursue a masters degree in data science now because currently my new research position revolves around clinical projects that are more data/bio-statics driven which I found much more interesting and after working in a hospital environment (and a lot of hours doing premed stuff \]: ) I've realized that I don't want to be a physician. 

My most important question is that I know the top **ds master programs all have some type of programming experience requirement for applicants**. To make up for this, I was wondering if I should enroll in a ds bootcamp or should I just take some classes online? I graduated from UC Berkeley and I know that they have a ds bootcamp and cs extension classes so I trying to see what is a good way to knock out those prerequisites.  I hope to be a competitive candidate for the top ms programs and as for research I currently have published a few papers as a contributing author but all in basic life science/clinical (no ds related projects), gpa around 3.4-5.

Also, if you can recommend what are some **top data science MS programs that you had good experiences** with that would be wonderful. I know a lot of premed students in my shoes right now so your advice would be very helpful to us!

I recently interviewed for a Credit risk analyst post and they offered me a paid intern position, if they liked my performance they said they'd make it permanent, and I have accepted it.

I'd like to know what my work usually is going to be, and  what's it like to work in a financial institution. And what my future is going to be

Has anyone ever made a serious mistake and submitted a model that performed very poorly? Or submitted a model that did good on test data, but when actually deployed produced very bad results?",Real modeling projects,1620016594
