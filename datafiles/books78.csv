books,"Sometimes there's books that I think about often and remember very fondly, and then it's always a shock to think back and remember that I didn't actually like the book that much while I was reading it.

The main book that hits this conundrum for me is The Walking Drum by Louis L'amour. It tells a winding story set during the BC era when the Middle East was the cultural capitol of the world. I feel more cultured knowing this history and feel like a much more informed person in general after reading this book. I've been thinking lately how cool that setting is and how much I loved reading this, until I stood back and remembered that I didn't actually like the story of this book! I thought that the story moved in random directions quite often and it was really a set of completely different moments that were strangely tied together. I think my joy at having learned about this era is what's causing me to misremember my sentiments of the story at the time.

Anyone else have books that they were glad to have read and have false nostalgic memories of?","Books that you didn't enjoy while reading, but still think about years later and remember fondly, even falsely remember loving them",1611531612

The protagonist, a lapsed Catholic, is out walking (in the woods?) after the incident, and has a vision, or witnesses a miracle (The Virgin Mary?, Angels), don't recall the details now, but she is overwhelmed by the events of the day and returns to her hotel room to find her husband there, with a toe tag still on, and with the use of the mirror in her compact, she determines that he is in fact still breathing, and has somehow made his way back to their hotel.  

The rest of the book is basically her trying to figure out what God wants her to do.  Whenever she does what God wants her to do, her husband's health improves, and when she doesn't, his health declines. She wants to divorce him, but doesn't want him dead, and guilt is a very powerful tool, so she tries to take steps to find out what she is supposed to do, and what it all means.

books,"""And the Lord said unto Cain, 'Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and **thou shalt** rule over him.'""

 The bold words are the ones in question in the story and as Samuel and Lee concede, the story of Cain and Able takes on a different meaning depending on which you use. ""Do thou"" is an order to rise above sin, ""thou shalt"" is an inevitability of sin's conquering, but ""thou mayest"" the most dynamic of the three leaves Cain with a choice to live an honest life or one of sin.  This is interpreted through the inverse of ""thou mayest"", ""thou mayest not"". It's a two sided coin.

Samuel's subsequent internalization of a ""thou mayest"" world gives him a justification to inform Adam of Cathy's location in the Salinas. Samuel provides his justification to Lee by saying, ""'Thou mayest rule over sin,' Lee. That's it. I do not believe all men are destroyed. I can name you a dozen who were not, and they are the ones the world lives by... do you see now why I told Adam tonight? I exercised the choice. Maybe I was wrong, but by telling him I also forced him to live or get off the pot.'"" **What I don't understand is why is this a sound justification, where ""do thou"" and ""thou shalt"" are not? Indeed ""thou mayest"" offers a choice, but how does it apply to Adam's situation? Lee and Samuel do not know if it was a good idea to tell Adam this so they cannot identify it's unveiling as a sin or not. Samuel says, ""That't it. I do not believe all men are destroyed..."" But the way I see it, the ""thou shall"" and ""do thou"" interpretations do not portray that all men are destroyed- it is actually the opposite.**  

To me, the replacement of ""thou shalt"" in Cain and Able's tale with ""thou mayest"" only serves to add more suspense to the human experience.  The ability for man to rise above sin in not guaranteed in this interpretation. It is an incentive and a warning to man that to rise above sin is not a guarantee.","""East of Eden"" Distinction Between ""thou mayest"", ""do thou"" and ""thou shalt"" and How They Play a Role in Samuel's Decision to Inform Adam of Cathy's Whereabouts in the Salinas.",1611523083

He's alive and well now and, for the second time in my life, helped me fall in love with reading.

books,"I'm almost a quarter of the way through book four of the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. A lot of the character development so far has been pretty good and kept me reading, but I'm slowly losing motivation to keep going. The way he writes women and gender relations is really outdated, and the way some of the female characters fawn over the main character reminds me of a harem anime. And the plot seems like it isn't going anywhere interesting - it's just main characters being pulled around by fate in between clashes with one of the one-dimensional bad guys. The penultimate straw for me is that the magic system is really lacking. There seem to be principles buried in there somewhere, but nothing is ever explained so there's no consistency or sense of what we can expect.

books,"This book is crushingly good. Kazuo's narrative feels like a shell game as he shows the readers all of Stevens regrets and insecurities while keeping Stevens totally in the dark.


Starting out I was sure this was going to be a light hearted comedy. It is hard to picture taking Stevens seriously when we meet him. He's a straight laced butler overthinking every conversation he has ever had. He is gripped by panic over the idea of being offered vacation time. 


The book remains fairly comedic, Stevens is constantly misunderstanding his own thoughts and feelings in a way that seems so obvious from the outside. It slowly gets more tragic as we are given all the pieces to put together. He spent his whole life serving Lord Darlington in the hopes that he'll be able to make some minor impact on important events, that he'll enable Darlington to reach greatness. He trusts someone else to give his life value and Darlington entirely fails. 


Now he is in a crisis that he doesn't even recognize. His work for Mr. Farraday is suffering because he doesn't have anything left to give. He wants to continue believing that his value comes from being a great butler, but by his own standard he is not one of the greats and he doesn't believe he has the opportunity to become one.


Meanwhile we're shown all the opportunities he missed with Miss Kenton to have a real life outside of his work.


The final scene is presented so well. I really believed he was finally going to catch on and realize that the way he measured his own value was making him miserable. It only makes the moment more tragic as he decides to double down on everything that makes him miserable. His decision to ”practice banter” in the hopes that it makes him a better butler is way too real, it does seem like the sort of thing you'd come across in a linkedin article.


Kazuo Ishiguro does such a great job balancing the absurd comedy with the very real tragedy here. It's hard to believe that a book where absolutely nothing happens could be so engrossing. I can't think of many other books that have had me so tense over minute changes in characters emotional states. I think I'll want to re-read it some day now that I know how it ends, although I think it might be a bit of a bummer the second time. Listening to him talk about what it takes to be a great butler knowing that he sees himself as a failure will put a damper on some of the comedic value.


What did everyone think? 


I'm sure there was lots I missed. I feel like there is more to Mr. Cardinal that I really didn't pick up on.

No spoilers but its about a woman named Mags whose father wrote a Billy and the Cloneasaurus-esque book about him and his family having to abandon their new home after a series of incidents caused by ghosts. You get segments of his book intercut with adult Mags returning to the house (which her deceased dad kept without telling her) to try and prove to herself the book was false. I don't think everything holds up by the end (which turns into a clown fiesta of reveals that started to lose me) but I was really engaged through the whole thing and the book does a good job of having some actually scary moments even though I wouldn't call it horror. There was also a plot point I'm glad they didn't go with related to Mags and her neighbor, glad Sager showed some restraint with that.

books," I started reading *Cloud Atlas* by *David Mitchell* (2004) and *Girl Woman Other* by *Bernardine Evaristo* (2019) the other day.

As I started Mitchell book, that is partly set in the past, I  felt uncomfortable about the depictions of B/POC characters and the use of racist terms. Clearly, it is describing the characters world view.  Nevertheless, it is written by a White author and is perpetuating racial stereotypes. (I now feel a bit angry at myself that I bought the hardcover book.)  

Evaristo is also using the racist terms, but in a different context and obviously much more critical.

I was now wondering how I should evaluate/ read Mitchell's book. Should I give it a second try and read it critical? Should I not read it? Should I at least cross out certain racist words? Initially, I  also wanted to donate it to the local library, but now I don't know if I really want to do that.

What is your stance of contemporary literature using insensitive/racist language? Also, how about reading literary classics that use racial stereotypes, such as in *The Merchant of Venice*?

The author world view is clearly linked to their writing's, so the author is an important factor for me how to read and understand a book.

So, I read this book an round a year ago, I was either 13 or 14. 
It was a book about a girl who discovered that she is half vampire. She also discovers that there is a community in her town that kills vampires. I think they were called warrior angels or something. 
Anyway, as far as I remember, the girls mother’s was killed by her father’s (the vampire) cronies. But then the angels came in and saved her. She trained with them and became an angel herself. 
I remember one thing was that she had a pink gun. She had a group of friends who she went out and killed the vampires with. Some of them where called Dean, Alice and Bruno or something like that. She also discovers she had a half brother who transforms into an angel, like a literal one, with wings. Then there’s another girl who turns into a vampire accidentally. And one who’s a witch. And one who can control water, and another who can control air. 
Anyway. I think the genre is action and adventure and romance. 
I got it on Kindle, it’s a series, one of the covers I remember was a guy’s face with a guitar. It was called Syrain’s song or something. 
It’s set somewhere around 2013 I think.

~Sorry for this long text, im feeling very elaborative lmao 

Tldr ;- looking for encyclopedia about drugs with brief information about each drug respectively 

Im not talking about drugs you can get over the counter, antibiotics, painkillers like ibuprofen and such. 
Im talk about a book specific on drugs that have an effect on the brain - benzos, opioids, hallucinogens, stimulants, amphetamines, mdma, ket, cannabis, alcahol... you know the deal. 

I have been obsessed on learning about drugs since forever, but i never bothered to experiment them nor do i want to. Im only addicted to nicotine haha, i guess the most normalized addiction nowadays, i smoke weed for medical reasons ( i have permission now but i used to smoke illegally frequently). Occasionally drank alcohol, and also take methylphenidate Ritalin 40mg a day for my adhd. 
But never in my life did i ever touch drugs, like you know hard HARD drugs ( yet alcohol is a hard drug .. but its treated like its not ?? Weird
 now that i think abt it) 
Anyway.. im just really fascinated in learning about them and researching on them.

Im looking for a book that has 


*every thing i listed is for each drug respectively;

•brief history about  each drug : the creation, the discovery. 
•its use throughout time : purpose, products and consumption.

• its effects on humans physically and psychologically : addiction, malnutrition, mental disorders, 

• the drug experience ; what you usually feel, euphoric, hallucinations, positive side effects, negative side effects ecc.

• how it came to be illegal : the decision, the cause, the process 

• what are they still currently used for ; medical marijuana- pain relief and is now being given to aid mental health problems / psychedelics - therapies / opioids - pain relief / amphetamines - adhd so on ..

• current studies that are being conducted , studies that are still being questioned, studies that have been faulty and also studied that have been debunked ( positive and negative)

In conclusion im kind of searching for a drug encyclopedia 

Thanks for the time hhahaha stay safe x",Anyone know about books that are dedicated to drugs ?,1611494811
books,"I finished The Winter of the Witch, the third book in the Winternight Trilogy by Katherine Arden today and it left me so sad. This series was new to me and I fell absolutely head over heels. I want more!

books,"It's as the title says. A long while ago my aunt gave me some books from her own personal shelf (not new ones) because she knows I like reading. Earlier today I was paging through one of them to find a singular page was half torn off. I assume her daughter's dog may have gotten to it and that she'd forgotten or was otherwise unaware. 
Now I am not sure what to do with it. I intended on selling it to second hand book shop since it's the second book in a series I wasn't really too interested in, but now that I've found this damage, there is no way I could sell it, nor pass it on to anyone else. I feel iffy about just throwing it away and I'm not the type to tear up books for crafting purposes. On top of that, I feel like it's been too long since she gave me the books, to point it out to my aunt. 
Anyone got any ideas?","Received a book from my aunt, turns out one of the pages is torn :/ Not sure what to do with it",1611492909

The thing is I really wanna read percy jackson because I love fantasy and harry potter etc but I also wanna read the new hunger games book but I kinda want to read through the first 3 books before I do that even though I've watched the movies...

books,"So there was this book I read when I was a kid. It was about personified whales and their journey through the ocean. One of the whales was named Melody and another was named Cacophony. The book centered around musical terms and the whales' personalities reflected their names. For example,  Cacophony caused a lot of fights.

books,"Almost $50 for a hard cover!? This is news to me!

I have a degenerative eye disease so I don't read my books, I listen to audio books.

I've had surgery on both eyes so I could read books fairly comfortable at this point but I've just been in to the audio books for so long, I've continued to be audio only.

Recently I set up a book shelf in my office. It has a bunch of bibles, video game strategy guides, archie comics, D&amp;D books, etc... Stuff that I can't really get on audio. Well, I do have an audio bible but it's always nice ot have some hard copies of the good news.

Anyway, the point is I thought that maybe I'd start buying hard cover editions of some of my favourite books to put on my shelves. I was thinking they'd be $20 each. Maybe I could buy one or two every paychequeue and eventually fill up my shelves.

And I'm not talking my favourite six books or something. I was thinking about getting all 15 Wheel of Time books. The 20+ Brandon Sanderson books I've read.

I guess if I was buying these as they released, maybe a couple every year, it'd seem less daunting. Oh well, it might just be a paperback kind of bookshelf.",I'm not sure if any of you are aware.... But hard cover books are expensive!,1611487841

books,"As I neared the end of this tome, I had decided if the book went on forever I would probably never stop reading. I am distraught it is over. I wouldn't say it is my all time favorite, but there is something about it that I could live in that world forever.

As the booked neared its end I started to get nervous. There aren't many pages left and we aren't at the battle yet. We have been building up over a half million words to this epic battle scene. The muskets ruining Ishido's army.

But then to hear Toranaga speak with everyone one by one, explain the intricacies of all his schemes. But his final monolog when he admits his ultimate ambition to be Shogun and the plans and his foresight. I accepted we would not be getting the epic battle scene. 

Then the concise summery of the following events as a cherry on top. Wow.
