Each row of my dataset is an individual post. Some users have up to 500 posts, some have as low as 10.

allows them to easily set up an environment and copy in the necessary data files from our server.

The problem with including the source data files in the Makefile is that the company server uses 
spaces in the drive name, which make doesn't like very much, so I can list those files as dependencies
for the target output file.

My current Makefile basically does only the following:

```
.PHONY : all
all : output.csv

.PHONY : copy_data_to_local_folder
copy_data_to_local_folder :
	python copyfile.py ""V:\\Server Path\\With Spaces\\Inputs 1.csv"" local/inputs1.csv
	python copyfile.py ""V:\\Server Path\\With Spaces\\Inputs 2.csv"" local/inputs2.csv

output.csv : combine_data.R local/inputs1.csv local/inputs2.csv
	Rscript $^ $@
```

The `copy_data_to_local_folder` part is just to get the data to the local directory, but it isn't included 
in the DAG leading to the production of `output.csv` (i.e. `all : output.csv copy_data_to_local_folder`) or else
the target would need to run everytime.

My solution ideas are the following, but I'm not sure what's best practice:

1. **Use a different make tool.** I could use `Luigi` in Python or `Drake` in R, but I would prefer to keep 
the tool somewhat more generalized.

2. **Run a setup script to copy in files.** I assume there would be a way to run the file copying scripts
as part of the environment setup, but I am unfamiliar with how to do this.

I'm a graduate student studying data science. For my elective next quarter, I'm deciding between Image Recognition and Reinforcement Learning. Since it's the last quarter before my full-time job search in September, it'd be fantastic if I could get some advice from you guys.

My goal is to land a data science position in a tech company, preferably e-commerce and ride sharing, but would also like to explore a bit while I'm in grad school. 

I think reinforcement learning is more linear to my goal since it could be applied to recommendation systems and route planning. However, I heard that this field is somewhat bloated with bubble--a great proportion of academic researches can't be replicated. A DS friend of mine said that RL didn't outperform ML models for her tasks at work.

Image recognition, in contrast, has wider application as of now and more academic researches to study from. Nevertheless, 2 counter points: 1) image recognition could be learned with lower efforts than RL so taking a course might not be worthwhile, 2) image recognition is more common on resumes than RL

datascience,"Hi,  
i was learning python for 3-4 last months and i have stalled.  But today I came across this subforum and I was dazzled. All these tutorials and textbooks excite me unhealthy, I'm just starting Data Science from Scratch, thank you!  

I'm 31 years old and I finished economics, but I regretted my whole life that I didn't go to mathematics. Is there still a chance for me? I would add that ultimately I would like to work remotely, even for much less money, because I love warmth and humidity, but data science seems to me an extremely group story, is this possible to achieve?",did I just find my life goal?,1584495176

datascience,"So I got into my company’s internal data science development program. Just wanted to see if y’all could share some handy resources and suggestions for books to get. I have some basic coding experience and some data visualization experience with Spotfire and Power BI. 

Topics include data cleaning, basic statistics, regression, trees, time series analysis, text analytics, story boarding, framing, cleaning and modeling just to name a few. 

We are also expected to work on a capstone project, utilize R and Python and do homework. 

It’s 7 months long and is expected to take up to 30% of my week. So any suggestions for classes, websites, or books would be appreciated!",Data Science Questions!,1584485242
