datascience,"Briefly, I have three sets of data from three different pools of participants and used the most recently collected larger set of data explicitly for a training set and used hierarchical clustering to identify cluster groups and then used the clustering results and that data to train a classifier to identify clusters in a test set (2 different sets) of data.

Question 1: What is the best statistical test to look for associations between the cluster assignments and external variables like reaction time, or other participant test features? 

I was considering multinomial logistic regression as it seems that research using clustering followed up the clustering with cross tabulation or logistic regression and reported odds ratios.  

Question 2: Can I run two different multinomial logistic regression tests for the different test sets? One group has additional external variables that were not collected in the other group that was collected a few years prior.

I recently had an idea to build a very simple ML model to predict one of the important Metrics in an eCommernce company: \`% Fail-rate\` ( \`# Fail Orders\`/\`# Orders\` \* 100%). The idea of the metric is to measure the reliability of the whole ecosystem of the order flow. And the data is time-series data, and I would like to predict the evolution of the metrics for, say, the next 4 weeks.

As a BI with limited hands-on experience with ML, I am thinking of building a prototype model with XGBoost. Yet, the labeled data we would like to predict here is a rate instead of an absolute number, so it may get a bit tricky.

I've made my first attempt with directly predicting the \`% Fail-rate\` with Dec 2020 data. Yet, I ain't sure if it would be a better practice to predict \`# Fail-Orders\` and \`# Orders\` and derived  \`% Fail-rate\` from the prediction result of these 2 absolute numbers.

datascience,"Problem

You don’t know how to make better decisions.

Solution

Data as a Service (DaaS) bridges the gap between your predictions and reality. The lower your spread, the better your decisions.

Data is a means to an end, if consumed as a product. However, insights are closer to the ""job to be done"", if consumed as a service. In this article I'll cover aspects of both.

In competitive environments, the more data is shared, the less valuable it becomes. For example, shared lead lists for marketers have low close rates, publicly shared transactions are already priced in to the value of stocks. However, in cooperative environments, like public health, data sharing is extremely valuable. Consider the case of covid at the moment. Keep this distinction in mind for the rest of the article.

Motivation

So what is powering DaaS? Very few companies had the ability to make use of raw data in the past. An order of magnitude more companies are buying data today than did 5 years ago. That's because a good engineer with a tool like Snowflake can be as productive as a great engineer 5 years ago.

We are seeing a commoditisation of data-warehousing with Snowflake, data lakes with AWS S3, and even Lakehouses with Databricks. The end user has ease of data ingestion with Fivetran, aggregation and monitoring with dbt.

These solutions are driving a rise to the market of alternative data, where companies are not only interested in internal (private) data sources but also external (public) data sources.

One example is hedge funds. Less than 3 years ago, just ten hedge funds were buying alternative data. Today there are 500-700 funds currently making investments to ingest large amounts of data.

Data as a Product (DaaP) vs Data as a Service (DaaS)

It is the difference between providing ""data"" and providing ""insights""

There are two broad mandates (I'm being overly simplistic on purpose) that data teams are formed with:

Provide data to a company
Provide insights to a company

In a DaaS model, the data team partners with stakeholder groups to tackle specific problems using data. Team members have more functional experience, and are responsible for providing insights as opposed to raw data.

Challenge

There are hundreds of companies that sell software and tools (traditional SaaS) to data scientists and machine learning teams. But there aren't many that specialise in selling data to teams that require it, in whatever shape or form (DaaP or DaaS).

Being a data-only business is less exciting because data is a supporting role.

Data companies support the true innovators.

It's like selling high quality butter to pastry chefs. The end consumer of the pastry may not even know there is butter in it, but the chef knows how important the ingredient was. Of course, the most important player in making a tasty pastry is the chef. A data company is just one of the important ingredients that goes into its creation.

Prediction

The last 15 years have been about how companies get insights from their own data -- Tableau, PowerBI, Snowflake, Palantir have played into that trend.

Companies that are far along the curve of getting insights from their own data need external data if they want to continue getting value from their data teams. Because even the largest companies only knows about 0.1% of the world from their internal data alone.

Nonetheless, there are still very few data buyers today. Most companies want applications (answers), not data (collection of facts). The only reason to start a data business today is if you believe the number of data buyers will go up an order of magnitude in the next five to ten years.

It's a great time to build a pure-play DaaS business if you’re bullish on this trend.

I think that a better way to ask this question might also be: what skills are essential for a data scientist to posses that isn't inclusive to a data analyst role?

Within the broader DS community, is there general acceptance for peers that don't have the strict academic background but still have the same KSAs, demonstrable proficiencies, and similar qualifications? Or is it like other graduate level careers, such as physicians, where lacking a particular degree is a deal-breaker?

datascience,"I am trying to teach myself about the multivariate normal distribution and I am struggling to understand some basic things about it.

To show my confusion, I use the famous Iris Flower dataset (I will use the R programming language for some basic scripts). The Iris Flower dataset has 5 columns and 150 rows. Each row contains the measurements for an individual flower (i.e. there are 150 flowers). The columns contain the measurements of the ""Petal Width"", the ""Petal Length"", the ""Sepal Length"" , the ""Sepal Width"" and the ""Type of Flower"" (three types of flowers, categorical variable).

Suppose I Just take the Petal Length variable. I want to see if the Petal Length follows a (univariate) normal distribution. I think this can be easily done using different strategies (R code below):

    #load the iris data and isolate the petal length  data(iris)  
    var1 = iris$Petal.Length  
    
      #visually check if the distribution of the petal length looks like a ""bell curve"" plot(density(var1))  
    
      #look at the quantile-quantile  
    plot qqnorm(var1)   
    
     #use statistics (e.g. the shapiro-wilks test) to check for normality 
      shapiro.test(var1) 
    
     #if the data is normally distributed, we can find out the mean and the variance
         mean(var1) 
    var(var1) 

Similarly, I can repeat this for the remaining variables in the iris data. However, this task becomes a lot more complicated when you consider the multivariate distribution of the iris data : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate\_normal\_distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) . When dealing with the multivariate distribution, there is now a ""vector of means"" and a ""variance-covariance matrix"". This means that there are more complex relationships within the data - some parts of the data might have a normal distribution whereas some parts of the data might not be normally distributed.

After spending some time researching how to determine if a dataset follows a multivariate distribution , I found out about something called the Mardia test, which apparently uses the ""skewness"" and the ""kurtosis"" to determine if the data is normally distributed (high skewness and high kurtosis means the data is not normally distributed). I tried running the following code in R to perform the Marida test on the iris data:

    library(MVN) 
     data(iris) 
     data = iris[,-5] 
     result = mvn(data)  result 

The results of this are confusing. I am not sure if I am approaching this problem in the right way. My question: How do you determine if the data you are dealing with has a multivariate normal distribution?

My ultimate goal is to determine if the data follows a multivariate normal distribution for the purpose of outlier detection. I found out about something called the Mahalanobis Distance : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis\_distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance)

If my data does follow a multivariate normal distribution, i.e. suppose (given the data) I evaluate the mean vector and the variance-covariance matrix of the data - I can use the Mahalanobis distance to find out which data points are situated further away from the center of the multivariate-normal distribution. The further the point is, the more of an outlier the point is.

Another idea I had - perhaps the distribution of more complicated data can be approximated by ""combining"" several (multivariate) normal distributions together ([https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html#:\~:text=A%20Gaussian%20mixture%20model%20is,Gaussian%20distributions%20with%20unknown%20parameters](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html#:~:text=A%20Gaussian%20mixture%20model%20is,Gaussian%20distributions%20with%20unknown%20parameters).) . Therefore, I could try to determine the irregular distribution of my data by combining (i.e. ""mixing"") several different normal distributions together (note: I am not sure if the resulting combination of these mixtures will necessarily have to be normally distributed?). Then, I could use the Mahalanobis distance to measure how far each point is situated from the center of the combined distribution - again, points that are further away from the center of the combined distribution are more likely to be outliers. Is this approach mathematically correct?

Can someone please help me in clarifying these details about finding out the distribution of multivariate data?

datascience,"**TL;WR** I created a [template repository](https://github.com/xhlulu/react-pyodide-template) to quickly get started with pyodide inside React, which lets you run data science libraries directly in the browser through [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/).

React is great for building neat UIs quickly, and you can build pretty advanced stuff without being required to communicate with a server. However, to use a Python library like `pandas`, `numpy` or `scikit-learn`, you would usually need to host a Python server (e.g. with flask) and connect it to your React app, which means the bulk of the computation will happen on your server instead of the user's computer.

Many projects try to address that by allowing you to Python code inside JavaScript. This [table from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58684358/13837091) summarizes the difference between the various projects (Brython, Skulpt, Transcrypt, Pyodide, etc.)

One notable difference is that [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) supports packages like `pandas`, `numpy` and `scikit-learn` thanks to it's Wasm-based compilation (much better explained [here](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/pyodide-bringing-the-scientific-python-stack-to-the-browser/)). The excellent [pyodide docs](https://pyodide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provide examples on using `pyodide` inside your html or JavaScript files.

However, I had trouble finding a template to get started with pyodide inside React. Others have proposed great approaches involving web workers in this [issue](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/issues/552), but I wanted to start from [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which is the most popular way to create a single-page react app boilerplate, and change as little as possible from the boilerplate.

I posted the resulting [template app](https://github.com/xhlulu/react-pyodide-template) on GitHub as a way to easily get started. The template shows you how to load a simple python script (which just defines a simple function and runs it), run the script with `pyodide`, and output the result to your `React` app.

I included the step-by-step process as a [comment to the aforementioned issue](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/issues/552#issuecomment-765167808), but in summary, I just changed the following files:

* `public/index.html`: Added scripts to load `pyodide.js`
* `src/python/script.py`: The python script we want to run inside React
* `src/App.js`: Added hooks and code to load the python file and run it

To give an overview of the problem, I have data collected every couple of seconds from a sensor. It's a little random but on average it's almost every 2 seconds.

|Timestamp|Output|
|:-|:-|

Our data is housed in a dinosaur of a software that is impossible to analyze with so I pull it out into excel to do things semi-manually to get my calculations. Most of our data points cannot even be accurately calculated because we are not reporting the data in the correct way. 

My job would include cleaning those processes up BUT instead we are switching to Salesforce to house our data. I think this is awesome! Except that I’m the one that has to pull and clean years of data for our contractors to insert into ECM. And because salesforce is so advanced, a lot of our current fields and data do not line up accurately for our new house. So I am spending my entire work week cleaning and organizing and doing lookup formulas to insert massive amounts of data into correct alignment on the contractors excel sheets. There is so much data I haven’t even touched yet, and my boss is mad we won’t be done this month. It may take probably 3 months for us to do just one program. And I don’t think it’s me being new or slow, I’m pretty sure this is just how long it takes to migrate softwares? 

I imagine after this migration is over (likely next year), I will finally be able to create live dashboards that run themselves so that I won’t have to do so much by hand every 4 weeks. But I am drowning. I am so behind. The data is so ugly. I’m not happy with it. My boss isn’t very happy with it. The program staff really like me and they are happy to see the small changes I’m making to make their data more enjoyable.

And I cannot just wait until we are live in salesforce to start program reviews because, well that’s nearly a year of no reports.
