datascience,"Hello, I’m a currently a sophomore undergrad majoring in statistics. I’ve only really done “statistical” programming in python and R, mainly done data analysis/cleaning and sklearn/tidymodels model fitting in a notebook or rmarkdown. And some basic dashboarding in streamlit. My plan is to get a MS in applied statistics and then work in Data Science. My major kind of aligns along the classical statistician type of background, which I’m okay with because I wanted a strong math background for a career in DS cause that’s what I THOUGHT was important. But I’ve come to realize that it’s a lot less important than software dev/cs skills. 

, I said to myself that I wasn’t going to complain about this because I thought that I would just try and learn data structures/algs and relevant cs topics to at least have some sort of software skills. But in doing so I’ve realized that I’m going to end up wasting my stats degree and never going to use it in industry.

Everywhere I’ve read about jobs in DS it’s that you need 75% software skills related to productionising and maybe 25% of statistical knowledge. These aren’t hard facts but basically from what I’ve read stats and math knowledge is not as useful as cs/software dev skills.

I’m just worried I’m going to go through all this schooling only to compete with software developers, and then learn all these various software tools only to become a software dev with a rigorous stats background and a “Data scientist” title when I’m not even doing any sort of statistical work, and my stats background will be a waste of money/time.

I want to be close to Machine Learning/statistical learning and building models, but it just seems like these software skills related to data eng/production tools are going to overshadow any statistical knowledge I have gained through my degree, thus making my degree a waste since I will be using maybe 5% of it.

I’m rambling here, but could any data scientists in industry here with an applied stats/stats background shed light on if their degree is really used in data science industry. And really how much statistical knowledge u actually get to apply relative to software dev knowledge? And if u felt like the degree was a waste compared to if you got a CS degree? 

It just seems like industry doesn’t actually care if you have stat/ML knowledge but more so if you can use software skills.",Worried that my degree will be useless,1612460076

datascience,"Hello,

A new project has started at my job that requires me and 2 other data scientist to work together. We are working more in parallel because a lot needs to get done in a short period of time. I want to use this opportunity to make sure we work cohesively for two reasons. One, make sure we deliver the best possible project given the time constraint and Two to get some managing experience. I hope one day to become a technical lead. All this being said what has worked for you guys in the past? Right now I have all the high level steps written down in a Onenote, essentially it can be split in to 3 parts and then substeps in each part. I plan on adding our code there, as I have gotten lost with my own code in the past and not been able to replicate results. Each high level step has a date for accomplishment and an assignee, I'm planning on adding more of my procedure as I go along ( adding substeps) but I'm not sure if my collaborators will want to do that, so I might have to do it for them.

datascience,"I was chatting with someone here in the sub about LinkedIn, and it made me realize something that I don't think gets discussed in enough detail when talking about job searches: ""networking"".

Most people will (correctly) tell you that networking is the best way to find a job. What most people don't tell you is that not all networking is the same, and not all networking is useful.

For example, I've had at least 1 or 2 fresh grads send me connection requests on LinkedIn asking me for a job for the last like 4 years. Most of the time I'm nice, I accept their request and tell them I unfortunately can't help them.

Technically speaking, these people have ""grown"" their network. Practically speaking, they have not *because there is no actual relationship there*. That is, unless you can create a point of contact *and then use it to create a relationship*, then that is not a real connection. 

So going on LinkedIn and shooting off random connection requests to a bunch of people you don't know and then asking them for jobs isn't going to help you. It's like a 0.001% chance of it having any impact in your job search.

Let's pause for a second and touch on an important topic while we're here: what is the goal of networking when you're looking for a job? It's not ""to get a job"". I want to make this clear: a connection isn't likely going to get you a job. They aren't even likely to get you an interview. The only thing that you should be expecting from a connection is that instead of your resume comingling with the 100s or 1000s of resumes submitted for a role you're interested in, that your resume will be almost surely one of the ones that gets looked at closely. That's it. After that, it's all you - you need to make sure your resume is spectacular, you need to interview well, etc. 

Yes, every once in a while you'll hit a home run and have someone in your network that is literally the hiring manager for a role you want (or has a real close relationship with someone in your network) and then you may be able to jump to the front of the line and go straight to an interview. But that is extremely rare.

Ok back to the original question: how do you network? I would say there are three things you need to focus on:

1. Strengthening/exploring your existing network of real connections (not fake social media ones): family, friends, classmates, professors, etc. People that you actually know and who, in turn, would have at least some predisposition to do nice things for you if you asked them to. If you're in the job market, the first thing you should do is reach out to people in this bubble that may have connections to the industry - and even if you don't think they do, ask. 
2. Finding 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn and having your common connection broker a conversation *that has a purpose*. A 2nd degree connection on LinkedIn is someone who shares a connection with you. So, say you're interested in a job at Company X, and you find that your college roommate is connected to Anne, a recruiter for Company X. You then ask your roommate ""hey, do you know Anne personally? If so, would you mind introducing me to her - I am very interested in their company and would like to see if I could be a good fit for a specific role they have. Also, if you can say some nice things about me that would be cool"". Or if you find a Data Analyst in a company you're interested in that is a common connection with a guy you had a class with, same thing ""Hey Bob, I see that Janet works at a company I'm interested in. If you know her personally, would you be willing to broker a conversation between the two of us? I'd like to get her opinion on whether I am qualified for X job at her company"".
3. Connecting with people with whom you share common interests that are somewhat specific. Say you like building models for fantasy football. There is a community out there of such people, and given that you already have something in common it is very reasonable to say something like ""hey, I see you too like fantasy football analytics. I have been working on this model that does x, y, z and could really use some feedback - and it looks like you've done similar stuff in the past"". If I am this other person, I am 10X more likely to reply to that and engage than I am to ""will you be my connection? I need a job"".",Networking - it's not just LinkedIn connections,1612368867
