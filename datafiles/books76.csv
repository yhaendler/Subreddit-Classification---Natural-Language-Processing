This book gives a good overview of the conflict known as ""Rhodesian Bush War"" or ""Second Chimurenga"", focusing only on what is important and detailing the units and major actions. The authors' prose is delightful, making it hard to drop the book once you start reading it. For its size, Peter Abbott and Philip Botham did manage to put a lot of useful information on this 48 page MAA.

Unfortunately, as this book is from 1986, all photographs are Black&amp;White. The authors did a decent job at presenting the Rhodesian badges and insignias, but missed the opportunity to add the famous badges of the RLI, the SAS and the Selous Scouts as insets on the plates.

Another problem is Peter Abbott's preference for showing walking out and cerimonial uniforms at the expense of combat uniforms, and the appearence of the plates do not reflect the actual appearence of the fighting men while ""in the bush"". The single biggest mistake of this book is to have only one plate of an RLI ""Troupie"", and using the Army Greens instead of the usual shorts with chest pouches and the typical field cap modelled after the French ""Bigeard cap"", with the Rhodesians using both locally manufactured and Portuguese ones. This fault is worsened by Abbott's choice to include a Zambian soldier in cerimonial dress; a plate that is very detached from the subject.

Another major blunder was to add Joshua N'Komo as a plate. Also, only two guerrillas are depicted, none using the almost universal ""ChiCom"" chest pouches, which is not depicted in any plate at all! The Selous Scout in plate C3 is unconvincing, as every picture about this unit shows heavily bearded men and they were nicknamed ""Armpits"" because of that, and the soldier depicted completely lacks facial hair. The regimental history of the Selous Scouts, as presented in this book, neglects the contribution of the Portuguese PIDE in its formation. Most plates are unarmed, and the SAS trooper is only depicted in his walking-out dress. The SAS and the RLI had to use AT guns in External Operations, so it would have been sensible to depict at least one AT operator. There is also a complete absence of Chinese advisors, that had a more important contribution to the war effort than the Zambian soldier in parade dress in plate F3. Also, Mugabe received North Korean advisors after the end of the war, and those advisors trained the Zimbabwe Army in its fight agains RENAMO (also neglected in the plates).

Overall, a very good primer, with a clear and very readable text, but disappointing in terms of color plates. A solid four stars.",Modern African Wars (1): Rhodesia 1965–80 (My Review),1610662492
books,"I just read the most extraordinary book and wanted to share. Crawford writes a coming-of-age memoir of her privileged life at an elite boarding school (St Paul’s School) in Concord, New Hampshire in the early 90s, where she suffered numerous instances of sexual abuse. It is fascinating for many reasons. She goes into great detail about life at the school, the routine, the traditions, the social hierarchy and how kids fall in and out of favor. She writes of the sexual abuse she suffered, the culture that allowed it and the institution that went to astonishing lengths to cover up the events and allegations. She wasn’t the first or the last, the school has had a history of the same things happening to other students. The Me Too movement is what finally opened the can of worms and was ultimately the reason Crawford decided to write her memoir. This young woman is highly intelligent and a gifted writer. Some people might feel she comes across pretentious with her big words and discussions of reading French poetry as a 15 year old. No. She is who she is. She was a bright girl who lived in a world of money and privilege. It’s part of the reason I found her book fascinating.  Crawford writes so beautifully too. Her descriptions of the school made me want to see the place for myself. I found the website for St Paul and watched the virtual tour. The grounds and buildings are picturesque and the classic New England beauty you might see on tourism websites. 

Another thing that resonated with me was the classic social-culture of that time period. It could be anywhere USA where gender and popularity determined your rank and one wrong move could shatter your rank or reputation. She wrote of the double standards, for example, how only girls could become somebody’s sloppy seconds, only girls could become socially contaminated. For those of you that went to school in the 80s and 90s, her observations will resonate with you.  I highly recommend this book. I’ve read a lot of books in my life and this one is most definitely being shelved amongst the great ones. I feel it would be the perfect book for discussion.

books,"I have a great memory. And I used to read far more than I do now. I read *Dune* in high school, and with the new movie on the spice-coated horizon, I figured I’d read it again (it’s been over 25 years). 

Woah. 

Firstoff... for 60s Sci-Fi, it’s complex. Philosophically, conceptually, and structurally, there’s both unique and common — likely due to its influence and lesser repetition. 

But what surprises me most, it’s nothing like my memory. I blame David Lynch as much as I blame the quarter-century. Scenes I thought I renembered are totally different, events happened in different order, characters are completely different, and there’s layers of complexity that I missed (as a 16-year-old that’s not surprising). 

I fully understand the stigma against Science Fiction, as well as how Sturgeon’s Law (90% of anything is crap) intersects with that (unpopular things are criticized based on the 90%), but with the rise of Geek Culture no longer being dismissed out of hand, I’m wondering if we will see a resurgence in interest in these classics. *Childhood’s End* blew me away about a year before I read *Dune*, and of course that’s now on my reread list.

books,"I've just finished reading *Fifteen Dogs* by André Alexis, and it reminded me how much I love Canadian fiction. If you live in Canada (or are simply interested in the country) and haven't given much thought to Canadian fiction, now is the time! There is so much quality literature coming from Canada these days that goes beyond the famous Canadian novels and novelists like Margaret Atwood (*The Handmaid's Tale)* and Lawrence Hill (*The Book of Negroes*). 

While *Fifteen Dogs* itself is perhaps not the most inspiring read, I love the emphasis on community, connection, language, and philosophy. For those unfamiliar with Canadian literature, these topics are often the focus. Canadian authors and authors who write about Canada often make use of the diversity of people and places to help them tackle these subjects. 

For instance, Miriam Toews' *A Complicated Kindness,* set in rural Manitoba (essentially the middle of nowhere), focuses on a Mennonite community and how their isolation, rigid conventions and dependence on each other is profoundly lonely for a girl and her father in the community. 

Ruth Ozeki's novel *A Tale for the Time Being* emphasizes the feeling of connection that we can get from reading and writing. Ozeki has the narrator, a Japanese-American woman living on an island off the coast of British Columbia, find a diary of a Japanese girl who desperately wants to live in America wash ashore one day following the devastating 2011 tsunami in Japan.

Ethel Wilson's *Swamp Angel,* in contrast, uses British Columbia's wealth of forests and natural spaces (although unfortunately this wealth has diminished significantly since this book was written), to write about a woman who finds peace in the wilderness when her life in the big city starts to feel like a prison to her. 

This is not to mention the many indigenous authors who continue their people's traditions of story telling despite Canada's terrible and painful history of erasure and genocide. Kevin Paul is my personal favourite. His poems are fascinating, and his writing provides a view of a relationship with nature that is fundamental and unassuming. 

This is only a small list of some of my favourite Canadian literature. I'm hoping to start a blog about Canadian fiction and I'd love to hear your opinions on these books if you've read them or any recommendations you might have for others getting into Canadian literature.",Here to make the case for Canadian fiction,1610656792

books,"A friend bought me this book as my mother struggles with illness. I'd never heard of the author, but gave the text a fair shot -- though, for its 200-something pages, it took forever to finish. 

Here is Where We Meet includes eight or so short stories that seem to be mostly magical realism -- some sort of blend of fiction, non-fiction and a way of recreating memories. The narrator introduces now-deceased characters he'd met during different periods of his life, in various locations. Sometimes he tells you up front the ""guest"" is dead; other times, it's a sort of shock/twist at the end. Either way, he introduces so many characters and locations -- and travels throughout time in such a convoluted manner -- that most of the stories lack cohesion. 

There is some beautiful writing in these stories, and a few -- particularly chapter five, ""Islington"" -- really resonate and flow. But even the occasional profound remark and often beautiful scene descriptions can't overcome a discombobulated narrative. I re-read several of these stories and it was like trying to put together a thousand piece-puzzle made out of words.

I did like the general theme, but thought the text failed its potential: The mind links and associates various events, places, people and memories to the present, often in unexpected ways.",Unpopular opinion: John Berger's Here is Where We Meet is pretentious and lacking in cohesion,1610652524

For me, I hate books in series. Look, I get that sometimes one book can’t handle everything you wanted to get out. But at least have a plan. Don’t just start throwing out sequels for the sake of fan servicing. Often times it ruins the planned out ending because the original books wasn’t created with a set sequel in mind. 

For example, Doctor Sleep by Stephen King, which is a sequel to The Shining. Look Mr. King, I get that people wanted to know what happened to Danny when he grew up. But everyone always wants to know what happened to the characters after any book ends. And while the book was fine, it wasn’t as much of a classic as the original in my opinion. 

Or the Cursed Child by J.K.  Rowling. I’m sure a lot of HP fans loved this. But to me it seemed like a fan service to release a sequel years after it ended. Just let the original books be. 

And don’t get me started on trilogies. I actually respect these since it’s just supposed to just be three books. But I hate getting to the end of the third book only to find out the author decided a trilogy wasn’t enough and added a fourth book too. 

Honestly, if I go to pick a newer book and I found out it has a sequel or upcoming sequel, I hesitate to read it. Because it means it’ll probably be incomplete, and who knows how many sequels the author is going to put out. I’m not some patient Rick and Morty fan that’s fine with waiting years to find out what happens and has to keep tabs on the progress of the new season or book throughout the year. I’d rather read a set of sequels that came out years ago and I don’t have to worry about sequels (even though there’s still a risk, like the shining).

books,"TL;DR: *Reincarnation Blues* is fun, funny, imaginative, and captivating. It's a great, fairly quick read. And it has some rad sci fi ideas I found very cool, but it doesn't necessarily make it a sci fi book. I think that if you read negative reviews of it, to me they miss the mark, though I have included some criticism here as well.

I recently read *Reincarnation Blues* by Michael Poore and I have to say I really enjoyed it, and would definitely recommend it. I also spent some time reading some of the reviews of this book and I find some of the negative reviews to be overly critical, and did not mirror my experience with the book.

Immediately the tone and some of the subject matter remind me of Tom Robbins' *Still Life with Woodpecker*. 

It's basically a lighthearted love story with elements of Sci Fi and Fantasy (the Sci Fi is how I found it), with some interspersed pseudo-religiosity (namely reincarnation/Buddhism?), that invariably deals with some heavy topics. IMO the sci fi elements are really just vehicles to deliver some premises to tell a certain story/lesson, and while I personally really liked those settings (and love sci fi), I think they're surface-level enough that if you don't enjoy sci fi, you still might like the book. As an example, there is a story on a planet where oppressive space colonialists abuse the local population for their resources. If you don't like that it's on a new planet with space ships - you could just imagine it takes place in a situation like the Russians in the Alaskan Sitka Sound (actually very apt), the Spanish in the Americas, or the Belgians in the Congo, among other despotic scenarios.

Here's the description of the book I found on amazon:

&gt;A wildly imaginative novel about a man who is reincarnated over ten thousand lifetimes to be with his one true love: Death herself. 

What the description above provides the author is a platform to tell a series of short stories that are imaginative and captivating, but that somewhat lack depth. I found myself longing for more details in some of these, such as a story that takes place on a prison asteroid, or several that take place in the past, in rural villages/cultures somewhat outside of ""time"" in a sense. Often feelings, moods, etc. are glossed over. You get a glimpse of the impact, but you don't explore it in the book. I found myself thinking about these situations whenever I put the book down, though.

Poore takes on a lot of heavy topics, including love, death, rape, murder, sociopathy, sex, family/child-raising, game theory, authoritarianism, consumerism, oligo-capitalism, and religion etc. in a very light-hearted and surface-level way. Some of the negative reviews seem to hate the way he approaches these, as if he is flippant and dismissive, or that he doesn't understand them at all. I disagree. I think the light, tongue in cheek approach shows that he understands the topics somewhat well, and that 1) this is how he copes with them, 2) this is how he writes about characters who use a variety of coping mechanisms, and 3) the story isn't about these topics or his opinions of them, more about using them as plot points that the characters navigate around. 

Some people are quite critical of the ""Buddhist"" or reincarnation aspects, calling it ""new-age"" and fake, and things like that. Personally I don't think Poore was attempting in any way to spread Buddhism, or even explore it. I think he used the premise of reincarnation and some tenets of Buddhism to explore life, love, and meaning (you could argue I am being hypocritical here - but I think you'd agree if you read the book). Put another way, they call him vapid, self-important, and new-age, as if he's telling you to read this book and join his new version of Buddhism, and listen to all the important things he has to say. I just disagree completely - I don't think he takes himself seriously at all - there's a bit of him in Milo, one of the main characters, I think. I think he found a great vehicle to tell a compelling story, with fun little lessons and parables along the way, but that is very much plot-driven.

A fair criticism of the book could be of Milo and Suzie, the two main characters. They're very much themselves, despite living so many lives across millennia. They don't learn all that much, they don't grow and change all that much. You can see that the person Milo must try to become to achieve ""perfection"" is pretty much who he is when we first meet him. Their character arcs are not very wide or deep. But perhaps that is part of the point. They're likable right off the bat, and it is interesting to watch as they get up to episodic hijinks, but if you argued they lack depth, I probably wouldn't argue back. That said, one reviewer argues that because Milo's name is ""funny and non-threatening"", that the author thinks very highly of himself... I- I just think that comment says more about the commenter than about the book/author.

It comes to a somewhat predictable, though satisfying ending. The way it gets to the end is roundabout and interesting. The last several stories are quite captivating, though there is a lull around the 2/3rd point in the book, roughly.",Reincarnation Blues by Michael Poore,1610650743

books,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I am currently reading all of H.P. Lovecraft's work and noticed several psychological points that I found really interesting. For those who have read Lovecraft, did you notice that the horror always results from exploration and research? I find that a lot of his characters express regret about their own curiosity and readings. An excerpt from At the Mountains of Madness reads: 

""It is absolutely necessary, for the peace and safety of mankind, that some of earth's dark, dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone; lest sleeping abnormalities wake to resurgent life and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out of their black lairs to newer and wider conquests.""

Several years ago, I read some of Jonathon Haidt's work (specifically The Righteous Mind). Haidt describes politically right-leaning people as more favorable to familiarity and tradition. At one point, Haidt describes the main difference between liberals and conservatives in terms of openness to experience, stating that conservatives tend to be less open to unfamiliar experiences than left-leaning people. Given what is known about Lovecraft's politics (he was raised conservative and has been labelled a white supremacist in recent years), I find it very interesting that the pursuit of knowledge or the unfamiliar is often the underlying horror in his works.

I wanted to put it out to the book world and as a question. Has there ever been a series, Fiction or not, that changed your life. Im talking books of stories not the self help kind.

  


I read the Sword of truth series as honestly the 5th iv ever loved but it has taken the \#1 spot in my recommendation list and I just can't help ""over sell"" as my friends say. I honestly finnished this series right after the final book release and ended up reading through them again currently.

This is new to me. I think about the characters daily. The lessons learned the points of view the light cast on subjects I otherwise hated. I have never read a book twice, a whole series non the less.

  


Does this happen to people, am I possibly dealing with some internal shit? Somone tell me im not crazy. This Fantasy Epic genre is the only style I can read and its only niche titles. Its soo good tho.","The Sword Of Truth Series, Addiction?",1610648339

I have been down the path of self destruction for quite a few years and I’m planning to go back to items that gave me happiness no matter how little it is. I have a big dilemma as to whether I should be getting books digitally (IBooks) or physical copies.

I will admit I used to have a sliiiight holier-than-thou attitude about but it know that’s completely unfair and I’m very willing to believe that some books are even better in audio format!

That being said, what are your favorite titles that might serve as an introduction to the whole world of audiobooks?

books,"I’m not talking about any book in particular, but from what I’ve read recently, all of them had fairly happy endings, yet I still shed some tears because the book was wrapped up so well at the end

When you dedicate your time to open a book and go on a journey with your characters, when you read that last sentence, or the last few pages, it sort of hits you in the face depending on what book, that your journey with the character is over, barring any sequels. 

Especially books with massive character development. For example, how a character starts off not being outspoken, accepting anything people tell her to do. And then throughout the book she gradually develops into someone who will rebel in a positive way for herself and for others. But when you get to that ending, and usually authors are great at wrapping the book up, as a reader, you see the development, and you are with them in that journey. So when I read those last few pages or the last sentence, and if the author puts it in a way that the ending will show how much the character has changed for the better, it’s just so bittersweet to me because I am happy for the character for becoming a better person, but after I read that last sentence, the book is done, and I will have to close it.",Endings are bittersweet because the journey is over,1610640828
books,"So, it took me a embarrassing amount of time, not because it didn't catch me, but because I had to left it due to college activities and it takes time to retake it each time, and the book itself is heavy.

But I could appreciate why is one of the best novels ever written and I consider it as such. The beginning shows a very bureaucratic side of the sanatorium, very Kafkaesque, which in fact, later will be an important influence for Kafka's work. My favorite part of the book is here, when &gt;!during a walk Hermine Kleefeld whistle to Hans Castorp through her pneumothorax, it's the most hilarious scene I've read!&lt;

My favorite part of the book as a whole was the different descriptions of the scientific knowledge of that time, namely medical related, it was a glimpse through which we can see how science was perceived more than 100 years ago, how much it have advanced and how much people knew. I also enjoyed the endless discussions and dissertations of Naphta and specially of Lodovico Settembrini, certainly my favorite character, but Naphta was the perfect opposite, conservative part for Settembrini's ideology and both the perfect background for Thomas Mann's self philosophical discourse.

The location of the novel makes it quite particular and original, *basically* everything happens in one place, yet it is enough to make the novel what it is and it is evident why it became a pioneering novel, and in my opinion a fitting reading during pandemic times. There are some intriguing characters, like Pribislav and Karen Karstedt, we will never know enough about them as we probably could wish. As Thomas Mann tends to be based on his own experiences, I wonder which and how many of the novel events actually did happened to him or did witnessed.

books,"I've been aware of it for some time, but after the riot (and yes partly because Amazon pulled it), it makes me want to read it even more. Apparently it's not even well written, but there's no denying its influence with extremists in the US. Is pulling it really going to reduce readership among them? Doesn't the academic and topical value outweigh 'banning' it? There are so many people who are vulnerable to that idealogy, which is probably a big reason Amazon decided to pull it, but I think it just motivates those vulnerable ones to seek it out.

Wow I really enjoyed this story, it was light and fun with some romance intertwined.

The character of Peter Winceworth literally cracked me up and I was definitely more into his side of the story. Kind of a really weird dude but in a lovable way.

I also loved how both characters stories played out in the very end. With Winceworth taking the chess piece from Sophia and running out of the party and the little twist with Mallory’s boss bombing the building.
