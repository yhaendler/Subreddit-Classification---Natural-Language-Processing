She's always been very bright however she has started in the last few years to really struggle with school due to personal reasons sapping her motivation (which I won't disclose for privacy).

She does have a really loving supporting family, who are trying to help - her mum and gran having been reading the assigned texts with her, but whether its a phase or something else, it's not clicking.

We don't have a huge age gap and I know I influence her a lot and I'd love to be able to use that to encourage her especially with reading - however I don't really know how. For me, it was always something that I loved, and I don't know how you can teach that.

books,"I saw the Studio Ghibli film years ago and was captured by it. It wasn’t the best film from the studio as a whole, but I’m a sucker for fantasy based stories so it was good in my opinion. 

I recently came across the illustrated complete collection of Earthsea at a Barnes and Noble and went to Amazon to purchase it a few days later after reading reviews about the series and of Le Guins writing style and prose. 

I finished the first novel, A Wizard of Earthsea last night and I can’t give it enough praise. No, it’s not the best book I’ve ever read. It’s not the best fantasy story either. But there was something about it that resonated with me, something fresh about it that stood out to me. It wasn’t about the dragons, or the magic, or the wild world it all takes place in. Of course she spent time on these things, but the story as a whole was about Ged and the struggle with his own pride and self. 

I’m planning to continue with the series, but I also had a question for anyone here who has read this series before.

As I read on, should I read them in publication order, as they appear in the collection that I own - or should I read them in the (what I assume is) chronological order. I found a recommended order online that seems to follow in a timeline. It’s as follows:

-  The Word of Unbinding 
-  The Finder
-  Darkrose and Diamond
-  The Rule of Names 
-  The Bones of The Earth 
-  A Wizard of Earthsea
-  The Tombs of Atuan

-  Dragonfly

I wanted to read more in 2020  and throughout the year, i had favourites which were replaced by new ones. First it was Lolita, then it was A Man Called Ove, then Misery. 

But now that the year is almost over, I think Pachinko is THE favourite. Considering how I didn't really read before 2020 (Except in H/S or college), the almost-500 page book was intimidating for me to start but it  was fast read and page-turner from the very beginning . 

There isn't some crazy plot or anything. Actually, It's a bit of a quiet book. It's about a common Korean family and just  the everyday life and struggles in Japan-occupied Korea and, later, in Japan itself where Koreans are discriminated against. 

I like how it gives other characters/family members some time in the light, and not just the main character (though I wish some characters had more time). The book starts off with the main character's parents, branches off to her and then branches off to her own kids/families then circles back to her.

This book especially spoke to me because it related to me on a somewhat person level. While I cant say anything to being discriminated against for being Korean, I'm (half) Japanese and I remember my mom telling me stories about her racist dad and her sister who married a Korean man but he/his family had to change their names to something Japanese so people wouldn't know they were Korean - my mom's dad included (because otherwise she would have been disowned).

books,"Okay. So I recently read [A Christmas Carol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Charles_Dickens-A_Christmas_Carol-Title_page-First_edition_1843.jpg/1280px-Charles_Dickens-A_Christmas_Carol-Title_page-First_edition_1843.jpg) for a show I do with a couple of friends*.* It is the first Dickens that I’ve ever read, and it was great. It has done more to get me in the Christmas spirit than any decorating, Christmas song, or movie ever has.

When I was reading it, though, I was struck by the idea of ghosts/spirits appearing at Christmas. But then I realized that I’ve seen this trope before. *The Turn of the Screw*, a spooky Henry James novella, is framed by some friends sitting around on Christmas Eve and telling ghost stories to one another. I then happened to hear *The Most Wonderful Time of the Year* play and heard the lyric “There’ll be tales of the glories and scary ghost stories of Christmases long, long ago”, and thought...*what the hell?* So I did some digging.

We all know the story of *A Christmas Carol (brief spoilers for a book published in 1843).* &gt;!Ebeneezer Scrooge--insular old miser--is visited over the course of a night by four spirits. The first is the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley, who shows up wearing chains he forged for himself in life (made of cashboxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel). He is there to give Scrooge a warning: This is your future if you don’t shape up. Then three spirits, in turn, visit Scrooge and show him scenes of Christmas past, present, and future. He learns his lesson, finds the true spirit of Christmas, and God bless us every one.!&lt; 

**But what does Christmas have to do with ghosts?**

Victorians were obsessed with ghost stories and the occult. Charles Dickens (along with heavy hitters like WB Yeats) belonged to “The Ghost Club”--an uppercrust organization that investigated claims of the occult. While Dickens was largely a skeptic, he boasted once in a letter of his “magnetic powers” and tried to cure a friend of her “spectres”. So part of the central device in A Christmas Carol would be familiar to Dickens’ Victorian readers.

But it turns out that ghosts at Christmas isn’t something that was invented by Dickens. Not by a long shot. Victorians had a bit of an obsession with ghosts, it's true, but the tradition of telling ghost stories at Christmas goes back to *at least* Shakespeare and Marlowe, and probably back to the pagan Yule and winter solstice celebrations that came long before Christianity was even a thing. 

This is because the winter solstice (to which Christmas falls suspiciously close) is a pretty natural time to think of the dead. The nights are long, the days short, and it was thought by early pagans that the solstice was the day on which the spirit world  had **particularly good access** to the land of the living. With little else to do in the evenings besides warm ourselves by the fire, it was only natural that ghost stories would come out.

And while Ghost stories at Christmas have largely fallen out of favor, while I was looking around it turns out that a whole bunch of what we associate with Christmas has pagan traditions. Stop me if you've heard this:

1. **Mistletoe** *(probably 100AD) -* Druids. Because mistletoe could blossom even during the frozen winter, the Druids came to view it as a sacred symbol of vivacity, and they administered it to humans and animals alike in the hope of restoring fertility.  
2. **Yule Log** *(date unclear...pretty dang old)* \- Nordic. From Wikipedia:   The familiar custom of burning the Yule log dates back to earlier solstice celebrations and the tradition of bonfires. The Christmas practice calls for burning a portion of the log each evening until Twelfth Night (January 6). The log is subsequently placed beneath the bed for luck, and particularly for protection from the household threats of lighting and, with some irony, fire. Many have beliefs based on the yule log as it burns, and by counting the sparks and such, they seek to discern their fortunes for the new year and beyond 
3. **Christmas Tree** (date sort of depends on what you consider a Christmas tree). From Brittanica:  The use of evergreen trees, wreaths, and garlands to symbolize eternal life was a custom of the ancient Egyptians, Chinese, and Hebrews. Tree worship was common among the pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity. 

Shrewd observers might notice that Christmas trees are really celebrations of light and life more than anything (lit with lights, decorated with apples, star on top), which makes sense if you are driving away the dark in the bleak mid-winter.

So, pretty pagan. In fact, Christmas was considered *so pagan* by the church, that the Puritans straight up outlawed it being practiced. They didn't like all of this talk of Yule, and trees, and celebrations of light, and thought it distracted from the work and worship that they loved. And while Christmas largely fell out of favor with the upper crust for a couple hundred years there, it stayed celebrated by the riff raff. 

**What does this have to do with Dickens?**

And then, in the 1800s, a couple of things coincided to bring a resurgence to Christmas. First, [Queen Victoria married a German and for the first time there was a man in Buckingham Palace who grew up with Christmas trees](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/First_Christmas_Tree_in_Britain_1846_Illustrated_London_News.jpg/396px-First_Christmas_Tree_in_Britain_1846_Illustrated_London_News.jpg). This was at a time when The British public was increasingly interested in the personal lives of the monarchy. When Queen Victoria got a Christmas tree it legitimized the (already increasingly popular) Christmas celebrations that had been going on in England among the lower classes for years.

Then, when Dickens published a Christmas Carol, it sparked a renaissance in the holiday. He wrote the book in 3 months, the first printing was released on December 19th, and it was sold out by Christmas Eve. It was an instant success and did more to solidify our modern idea of what Christmas is than much of what had come before it. Family, friends, gathering around the hearth, and goodwill and charity to all mankind. 

Eventually, the Holiday was so popular, that the church legitimized it.

So next time you read A Christmas Carol, [watch the Muppets do it best](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppet_Christmas_Carol), or stumble across some reference to ghosts on Christmas, remember what Dickens wrote:

&gt;The ghosts of Christmas are really the past, present and future, swirling around us in the dead of the year. They're a reminder that we're all haunted, all the time, by good ghosts and bad, and that they all have something to tell us.",What's the deal with Christmas ghost stories?

So for my birthday, I got a $25 gift card to Barnes and Noble. Stalked a few GoodReads friends and decided to pick up Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman (I also picked up A Little Life, but haven’t started it yet).

books,"This year I was determined that I’d try and read 20 books. I began reading properly around mid 2019, so I thought it’d be good to set myself a goal for this year. I ended up reaching 30 books, with many days off too! I think I’m surprised at myself because although I read a little bit, I wouldn’t usually finish one book in a year. 

I think so much of this has to do with school. During primary school high school I was encouraged to read fiction. However, I could never really find any fiction books that interested me. Then I found out that my favourite type of fiction is horror, but I don’t think that was available to me at school (or I just didn’t look properly). I think being told by somebody else that I have to read made me not do it and to an extent feel frustrated about it. I also found out I prefer to read non-fiction, but again my schools insisted I read fiction. I think that’s the main problem with schools and reading since they dictate what you can and can’t read, or what you should or shouldn’t be reading (at least in my experience).

When I started college, my teachers encouraged me to read non-fiction, and after trying it I really enjoyed it and realised that reading is actually a great hobby. I’ve learned so much and enjoyed reading in the past year and a half, and I’m looking forward to reading more in the future. 

So, for anybody who feels frustrated by reading, or feels as though they can’t pick it up as a hobby, the likelihood is that you can. Explore different genre and find what you enjoy reading the most.

books,"I first started Pale Fire last year, but quickly gave up on Page 73. I read the forward (of course) and then the poem, to be familiar as I was reading the commentary. But the constant page flipping (not only back to the poem, but to a different comment, which would cite a different line, and would also cite ANOTHER different comment)!!! was infuriating. You'd read about 20 pages but would have only made one paragraph of progress. Not to mention how you kept track of what you read because when you go read a future commentary that was cited from a previous commentary, do you read that commentary again later on? There'd be a lot of rereading. The book also had the unfortunate consequence of being chosen during a ""great book hangover"" (The Tunnel), and I was looking for a short quick read. 

Long story short, I picked it up again. I'm giving it another chance because now I know what I'm getting into and I know it's supposed to be really good. But this time, I'm skipping all the page flips from commentary to commentary. If a commentary for line 131 cites commentary for line 429, I'm not flipping to that commentary. I'm finishing line 131 and moving on. Only flipping back to the poem from time to time. 

Is that the wrong way to read it? Am I missing out on the way the novel was truly supposed to be experienced?",Am I Reading Pale Fire Incorrectly?,1608824964
books,"There doesn't seem to be anything more capable of capturing my imagination than a story about ambition and war. I am drawn into the escapism of the adventure, and vicariously revel in the triumphs of my protagonist. 

It's all about war and money. That's the good stuff. On the surface at least.

Fellow readers are going to call this contest in favor of JA &amp; SM right off the bat. I have only just finished ""HMS Surprise"", and I would probably lean in that direction. 

This Patrick O'Brian series is a brilliant combination of rich dialogue and a clever background melodrama. In this way the characters are brought to life so naturally that the reader gets a special sense of realism and familiarity. The subtle tones of affection, petty resentment, and even cruelty kind of grow beneath the text, sort of unsaid and underneath the story. It's really clever.

There is something very comforting in the friendship of the two MCs. It's a constant. It's casual. Wether one is saving the other's life, or simply offering a glass of Madeira. Their humorous dialogue and regard for one another, and private reflections on the other's character, are what makes these books so popular..

What I want to do is compare the action. I want to say that the Horatio Hornblower books have more action. I will borrow a phase from another redditor, who in describing the scenes of battle said: ""you can smell the gunpowder!"". I love that about CS Forester's Hornblower series. I get enormous gratification and excitement out of these scenes of naval conflict. It is fantastic to imagine these beautiful warships firing off broadsides and carronade.

I give CS Forester credit for entertainment value.

In it's more condensed and repetitive format, you know that there will be bloody conflict and loot. HH is the lone genius that will save the world from the Corsican tyrant.

These books are comparatively less complex, and are populated with many more one-dimensional ancillary characters. 

Following that reasonable criticism can lead to overlooking the actual quality of the writing and the unique talent of the author. Written and published in an earlier era of novella and cereal fiction, the Horatio Hornblower character can almost be compared to a comic book superhero. 

Ultimately these things are a matter of preference. For me Aubrey-Maturin is better, but Hornblower is more entertaining. 

I have been on a big naval historical fiction jag recently. I posted my impressions of the Hornblower series about a month ago, and knew that I would have to get further than Master and Commander in Aubrey-Maturin. I appreciate all feedback. Finding a good new book/series is almost impossible nowadays.",Aubrey-Maturin vs Horatio Hornblower,1608824868
books,"If you ever ordered from them you know that if you order less than a couple of books, they'll ship it in a padded envelope instead of a cardboard envelope / cardboard box.

This usually results in bent covers, bent edges, and sometimes even torn covers.

Every time I get a package from them I pray that the books inside will be in good condition - which makes me wonder, what's the big deal to put every book in a little bit more secure container?

I'd gladly pay a couple of extra $ for shipment if they provided the option to ship in cardboard container.

I tried contacting them in the past but nothing changed... maybe if we raise our voice here something will.",What's up with BookDepository's packaging?,1608824426

books,"Personally, I'm getting tired of the big high-fantasy, world-building series. I haven't read that many, but they all seem to share the same core elements, that I dislike. 

* Characters that get away with too much
* Main characters that exemplify too many good traits, even if they're kinda contradictory to their upbringing.
* The names. Jesus Christ is it impossible to keep track of 30 names with random linguistic roots, city names, character names, animal names, food names zzz. 
* Modern fantasy writers also seem to be really hesitant to flip morality, meaning we get main protags that are bad being from a modern morality standpoint. 

It's why I enjoyed ASOIAF so much. It seems to have flipped on so many aspects I mentioned here.",Have any of you gotten massively burnt out on a genre? Share your story,1608824131

The novel was recommended by a librarian friend. Published in 2003, I had never heard of it. A pleasant surprise for a lit major who is always looking for new reads. This should be considered a 21st century classic.
