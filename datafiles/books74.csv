books,"I'm relatively new to my company and volunteered to lead their new book club as a way to meet new people. I'm no literary expert or anything, just love books and thought it was a good way to become more involved. I chose The Cold Millions by Jess Walter as our first book and our first meeting is tomorrow.

I have the discussion questions that came with the book but I'm suddenly so nervous. Does anyone have good feedback on book club formats that worked? How to keep discussion flowing naturally? I'm so worried I won't so a good job or won't be insightful enough and it'll be boring.

books,"I find it difficult to sympathize with most of the main characters. As such, while i do love learning about the time period and atmosphere, I'm starting to become a bit bored with the plot. I feel no sympathy for Vronsky, and i do not feel like we are given enough insight into Anna her reasons for acting. The only plotline that really interests me so car is what happens to Levin, whether he'll still end up with kitty, or be able to move on(perhaps even find another girl who shares his interests?)

As such, right now I'm losing motivation to keep reading, even though i heard a lot of positive comments on the book. Will my feelings on the book change? Am i considering dropping the Hobbit before they even leave the Shire? Or if I'm not interested by now i probably won't be captivated by the rest of the story either? Did anyone have a similar feeling about the book? And did your appreciation of the story increase after you kept reading?

To be sure:  currently I'm at book 2 chapter 17, where Stephan visits Levin to sell his forest. I dont really mind spoilers about the general direction or theme of the book, but please avoid major specific spoilers.

books," On first reading this text, what struck me as most surprising were two factors- the level of meta-commentary on the book itself and the repetition of certain nearly formulaic adventures, specifically those regarding marriages between youths of unequal births.

Don Quixote is already exhausted by a sense of belatedness. Not only does Quixote take his sense of character the many stories of chivalry he has read, but by the time we get to the second part most of the major characters have already read either the ""authentic"" history of Don Quixote or the perfidious sequel written by an unnamed (I think) forger.

The combination of these elements almost gives the reader a sense of vertigo as if he or she is lost in a room of reflecting mirrors. If this was Cervantes' aim, to produce a novel which is a gradual re-writing of itself, it comes at the cost of a deep sense monotony. The lovers eventually become rather forgettable and are dismissed almost as quickly as they are introduced.

Perhaps Cervantes, who wrote the second part a full decade after the first, wanted to acquiesce to the demands of readers who may have wanted a new version of Don Quixote but not a new story. After all, how much can a sequel really vary from the original before their incongruities lead to dissatisfaction?

Of course, these are not the only repetitive elements throughout the novel which makes continuous use of some structure in order to involve our duo in adventures, Don Quixote's constant disparagement of Sancho's use of malaphors and inappropriate proverbs (a habit introduced in vol 2 which is seen nowhere in vol 1) becomes increasingly tedious after the 3rd or 4th time it is emphasized, just as his lavish declarations of love and devotion for Dulcinea transform from something whimsical and witty to something turgid and belabored.

Maybe it is a curse of modernity to feel as though someone should have gone through this book with a heavy black pen, crossing out all these repetitions which give the book a kind of narrative heft and depth. In Vol 1, you sense that Cervantes attempts to avoid these feelings of repetitiveness by interrupting the novel with various novellas or questionable relevance. There is also, I think, a kind of passive resistance employed with these tangents on Cervantes' part by which he avoids turning Quixote into an actual knight which an actual mission.

The stories that Quixote encounters on his journey are almost as fantastical and contrived as the books of knight errantry which Cervantes aims to satirize. He meets ""real life"" princesses and escaped convicts and eats at lavish weddings which take up nearly an entire forest and in which rival lovers compete for the affection of a smitten lady. A vast comedy of errors ""really"" does happen, where in an astronomical piece of luck 2 pairs of lovers re-exchange to the general happiness of everyone involved. These stories are themselves repetitions of reiterations other comedy novellas.

Quixote's constancy, loyalty, devotion, and courage, though tested, are never completely overcome. although he does at times allow Sancho to suffer instead of rushing to his defense which leaves an indelible stain of cowardice on his armor. Quixote's otherwise immaculate constancy is what leads to the repetition of events. They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Cervantes plays a cruel trick on us then by giving us a character of unquestionable devotion and condemning him to the same foibles in various iterations. He brings us closer the nature of insanity by asking us ""what did you expect would happen to our knight?""

It is only when The Knight of Mirrors (Knight of the Moon) enters in labyrinth of his fantasies that Quixote is able to successfully extricated from his delusions. The truth never triumphs over delusion, stronger delusions replace them until we get to the final tragic pages where we read of ""Quijano the Good"".

All in all, this sense of repetitiveness and reiterations together did manage to produce something novel, original and timeless. We continue to reiterate and reinvent Don Quixote and his simple squire Sancho Panza.",Don Quixote: Repetition and Reiteration,1609799123

books,"Because of my mom's influence, I've read *a lot* of murder mysteries and thrillers. Sure, each series or stand alone books are unique with twists and turns, suspects and victims. But they always took place close to or in cities, towns or houses.

Early last year, or maybe around summer idk, Mom hands me a book called Deep South, written by Nevada Barr.

Although old, I really love the books. Instead of the murders taking place in cities or houses, the victims die out in nature or their bodies are dumped in places. 

Instead of a cop or detective, the protagonist Anna Pigeon, is a park ranger. She's solved murder mysteries in different places.

books,"Woodward, the #1 international bestselling author of Fear: Trump in the White House, has uncovered the precise moment the president was warned that the Covid-19 epidemic would be the biggest national security threat to his presidency. In dramatic detail, Woodward takes readers into the Oval Office as Trump’s head pops up when he is told in January 2020 that the pandemic could reach the scale of the 1918 Spanish Flu that killed 675,000 Americans.

In 17 on-the-record interviews with Woodward over seven volatile months—an utterly vivid window into Trump’s mind—the president provides a self-portrait that is part denial and part combative interchange mixed with surprising moments of doubt as he glimpses the perils in the presidency and what he calls the “dynamite behind every door.”

At key decision points, Rage shows how Trump’s responses to the crises of 2020 were rooted in the instincts, habits and style he developed during his first three years as president.

Revisiting the earliest days of the Trump presidency, Rage reveals how Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats struggled to keep the country safe as the president dismantled any semblance of collegial national security decision making.

Rage draws from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand witnesses as well as participants’ notes, emails, diaries, calendars and confidential documents.

Woodward obtained 25 never-seen personal letters exchanged between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who describes the bond between the two leaders as out of a “fantasy film.”[Range Ebook](https://trendbooks.myshopify.com/products/rage-ebook)

Trump insists to Woodward he will triumph over Covid-19 and the economic calamity. “Don’t worry about it, Bob. Okay?” Trump told the author in July. “Don’t worry about it. We’ll get to do another book. You’ll find I was right.”

The second book is *Anna Karerina*, and one would assume that Anna is the main character, but I'm only a couple of chapters in and the protagonist so far is this dude named Stiva.

If both parties finish, then they both mop together. \*There is a caveat, if the one party finishes a book early (finished reader), the other party (challenging reader) can challenge the finished reader to read an additional book the challenging reader picks out. If the finished reader wants to accept, they are obligated to finish the book or they have to mop floors without help. But if they finish, the challenging reader would have to do the floors.   


I am currently reading The Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton. My strategy going into this was to chose a short book to make sure I finish monthly. The book has been a real surprise in how fascinating it is, and I have never read any of his books. Requiring myself to finish a book is forcing me to find readers I may not have on my TBR list.

books,"I have read Killing Commendatore and half of 1Q84 as well as half of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.

I read these books because Murakami is regarded as good. I wanted to know what the hype was. I liked Killing Commendatore, but I constantly felt like I was missing something. Like he had put meaning into the book, and that I was just too dumb to get it. (Which is a silly statement considering I am most certainly not dumb.)

I started 1Q84 but didn’t have time to finish. I started The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle but got frustrated because after constantly putting it on hold and only getting it for 7 days at a time, which is not enough to finish, I was only halfway through. Plus, I still felt like I was *missing* something. Also, the sex scenes and boring characters (which felt like self inserts honestly) felt...bad. 

So I did some research. And I found an interview.

“People ask me, ‘Why fish? And why are they falling from the sky?’ But I have no answer for them. I just got the idea that something should fall from the sky. Then I wondered: what should fall from the sky? And I said to myself: ‘Fish! Fish would be good.’”

Oh, that pissed me off. You mean I spent 45+ hours reading your books and they mean *nothing*? You’re just here to write down whatever pops into your head? Fuck off.

*Why couldn't we have gone into the other implications of the tech? What would religious institutions have to say about it? Would it have spawned new beliefs and so forth?

What would be the attraction for a straight person? To read Gay romance? I hope you're with me. It's like me asking what would be the attraction for a gay person to read straight people romance if they feel nothing?

So that's when I decided maybe I'm homophobic &amp; she's ahead of the curve &amp; I need to catch up with the times. Since I was familiar with Rainbow Rowell's work &amp; Carry On is such a phenomenon in the community I decided to start there. 

Although I must admit I was very hesitant &amp; delayed reading because I love Harry Potter &amp; the idea of fanfiction did not sit well with me. I read it. It did nothing for me. I did not enjoy it at all.

Fast forward a year or so, I make an instagram page to promote Rainbow Rowell books so that Netflix picks up her work for adaptation. I post a lot of pictures of all her books (even the ones I dislike for fans of those books) I manage to gain followers from various parts of the world. Netflix even likes some of my pictures. 

Then I realised I wasn't posting Carry On much since it didn't work for me. So I make sure to keep my bias in check, change that &amp; start uploading pictures of Simon &amp; Baz from Carry On. Surprise Surprise people love it. Turns out Carry On is her most popular work. It garners the most attention! So I keep going , I search the whole internet for rare pictures/artwork etc - Credit the artists &amp; upload them. Among all of Rainbow Rowell's work Carry On gets the most traction. But I was still unable to understand the obsession with it. Especially for straight people. 

Again I request, I don't have time rn to type out details about my upbringing/culture/history with LGBTQ in my country etc. Broadly categorizing as third world so that you get an idea. 

What I want to know is if I'm not into the genre does that make me Homophobic? Because you get attacked if you say you're not into Gay romance as a straight person. And I've tried reading a few others just so that I get over any ""unintentional Homophobia"" in my mind due to the environment I grew up in... But it still doesn't work for me. 

So yeah...Looking for informed opinions/understanding on this subjec matter. Please be civil. Thank you.

TL;DR : What the title says.",Am I Homophobic if I'm straight &amp; not into Gay romance books? [ Ref: Carry On by Rainbow Rowell etc],1609779919
books,"I honestly listen to this book so many times last year and I also read the paper version. 
I always get something new out of it and I tried to recommend it to a lot of people last year because I think the book would have gave people a lot of peace.
I know some people will shittt on Mark Manson, but I honestly get a lot out of his work. He tends to have to many one liners in his book that get annoying but the overall messages are great.

In this book the two main things I got out of it was choose to be a better person for no other reason than it’s the correct thing and choose your pain. 
I’m not doing the book and justice with the way I’m explaining it but I honestly think it’s a hidden gem.",“Everything is f*cked A Boom Abiut Hope” by Mark Manson is a great book,1609779790
