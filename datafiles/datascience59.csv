It was something I really struggled with at the beginning of my DS career and to be honest, it’s something I still struggle with from time to time.

I have been working as a Data Scientist for different companies for around 4 years now. The last period, almost 2 years, have been in a consulting company (MBB) but in the Data Science team. 

I am currently trying to change job and every job interview I do, people usualy ask more about the previous company than the consulting one.

datascience,"My professional path has been a bit all over the place. I originally went to school for media production and spent a good amount of time as a production coordinator. I ended up hating that industry and transitioned into a number of managerial and coordinator type roles in everything from the service industry, to most recently tourism. I'm currently the sales coordinator for my local tourism bureau and I've found that the part of the job that interests me most is the small look I get into data analysis. I've become the go to for running reports on our CRM as well as interpreting the STR report. I really believe this is a field I could excel in and love doing. However, like many women, I spent most of my adult life and college years believing I was best suited to ""softer"" fields. I always thought my strengths were in creativity and communication. Now I see those traits would work well hand in hand with a more STEM rooted field. I no longer doubt myself in that way, however I'm definitely far behind. I don't have statistics or computer programming courses under my belt, and I've been out of college for a number of years now. 

My question is this: what can I do to get myself caught up so that I could pursue a masters degree or certification in the near future? Would coursework or certifications on Coursera do the trick to catch up on foundations, or is there something else I should look into?

A model that predicts if a user rejects or not certain task, and there is a feature that is the % of rejection (over time), when training if user x has rejected that said task, the % feature increases in that instance. Is the model able of detecting if that feature increase compared to the previous entrace of user x automatically means that the feature it's trying to predict has a target of rejected? Or the model only looks to one particular instance at a given time and this doesn't matter when training? 

Question is am I facing feature leakege if I don't shift these features in a n-1 factor?

If I am using a random forest than each instance is a set of trees so it can't look to the ""past"" to infer this information in the set, however if hypothetically a linear regression was used (this isn't the case since we are looking at a supervised classficiation model) the slope would change then the ""past"" and the ""future"" aka previous and next user x instance would let the model infer  such data.

I am working on my dissertation research where I am attempting to build a generalizable machine-learned method of predicting student a student's likelihood of dropping out of high school (at-risk status).

* Is there a way to replicate this approach using R or Python? From what I understand, this specific GMM approach only exists in Mplus.

* If it's possible to use something other than Mplus (and this more of a dissertation advice question), do you think it is a good idea to use a different software approach? I'm not very confident in my knowledge around GMM's, and I'm afraid the libraries in Python or R are implemented differently, not mention the lack of available resources on how to conduct this type of analysis.

But if you are considering multiple job offers, it's worth asking if they have open office layouts.   They're quite popular with some companies (mostly because it's cheap and easy to cram in extra people I suspect).  They claim it enhances ""collaboration"" but that's effectively a lie in my experience.

But I am here to tell you, I hate it.  I work in an office where there are 3 workstations side-by-side along a long table/desk with maybe 3 feet between them (occupied by you own personal cubby reminiscent of elementary school) and facing a second such desk so your monitors are literally 2 inches from the person sitting at the desk across from you.  And five feet behind you is the back of the person at the next row of desk.

God help you if someone has an annoying habit of humming or something.

datascience,"1) I found a paper online ""Popular Ensemble Methods: An Empirical Study"" (Opitz, Maclin, 1999). Was this really the first observed use of ""model stacking"" (ensemble learning) in statistics?

2) What is the proper way to ""stack"" models in statistics? I heard there are two ways. For example:

A) train 3 different algorithms on your data (supervised classification task, binary response): 

 k-nearest-neighbor (k=5), random forest (mtry = 4), neural network (3 layers, 15 nodes). 

For a given observation, avergae the output probabilities corresponding to which class that ovservation belongs to.

B) train 3 different algorithms on your data (supervised classification task, binary response): 

 k-nearest-neighbor (k=5), random forest (mtry = 4), neural network (3 layers, 15 nodes). 

For a given observation, feed those probabilities into a logistic regression model; essentially making a logistic model between target classes and output probabilities.

Are both of these correct? What is the logic of adding a second stage logistic regression model? Is A) not enough?

3) Does this analogy make sense? Suppose there are  two students on a quiz show. One student is has good general on all topics, but the other student only has really strong knowledge on one topic (e.g. sports trivia). The students agree that when a sports question comes and they both know the answer, they  will probably be correct. 

The same way, suppose I make an ensemble stacked model with knn and random forest. Individually on a given dataset, random forest has decent specificity and sensitivity, but knn has really good specificity but poor sensitivity.

Would it make sense to combine these models in an ensemble, with the logic that they will help each other? Or will the poor sensitivity of one of these models sabotage the potential gains (and in retrospect, its probably better just to stick with the model having both decent specificity and sensitivity)?

4) Suppose I have a dataset with both categorical and continuous features. I want to make an ensemble model with neural network and random forest. Random forest can handle categorical and continuous data, neural network requires some type of encoding (e.g. one hot encoding). 

Thus, can you make a stacked ensemble model with two models where you one hot encode the data for one of the models, and leave the data as is for the other?

5) misc questions: 

C) does random forest make predictions by averaging bagged probabilities? Or by majority class voting? Is there an additional advantage for one of them?

D) i think this is obvious, but you can still modify the classification threshold in an ensemble model? E.g. instead of ""if final probability&gt;0.5 then 1 else 0"" ....""train"" this threshold and determine an optimum (e.g. final probability&gt; 0.45)

https://nishanthu.github.io/articles/ClusteringUsingRandomForest.html

Recently, i came across these links explaining how the random forest algorithm can be used in an unsupervised environment: the random forest creates a proximity matrix (proximity is loosely defined as a measure of how many times two observations appear close together), and this proximity matrix can be used as inputs for standard clustering algorithms (e.g. k means).

1) Has anyone tried using random forest for clustering unsupervised data? Are there any real advantages of doing this?



2) is it fair to assume that using the random forest algorithm for unsupervised clustering: suppose if the random forest itself does not fit the data well (if we could somehow determine this), the results of the clustering would be inherently flawed?",Unsupervised random forest,1602971623

datascience,"Hi,

I work at a consultancy and as the title says, my main job is Data Scientist, but my new project is in need of team restructuring and organising. Due to the fact that there is no trained Scrum Master available to join our project, I have to take on that role. I've already asked on r/agile and r/scrum but I thought some senior Data Scientists here might be qualified to respond as well?

I understand what I have to do, but this is a huge and very complex project with 10 different teams in it. So not only do I have to organize my own team, I also have to be the point of contact between all those 10 teams because good inter-team communication is crucial for the success of this project.

I will explain what the situation of my team is below and please do let me know if my strategy is good/bad (and please do keep in mind I've never done Project Management or Scrum Master type of stuff before):

Basically my team is the one at the end of the workflow (we are 10 people in this team). We are the ones that get URGENT requests (specific questions that can be answered by using stats/data science) from the client and we have to deliver the (complex) insights in 3-4 days max. The only way we can deliver those insights quickly is by communicating with the other teams (all teams work on the same datasets). So the other teams sit towards the start of the workflow and they do some basic EDA (exploratory data analysis), they come up with hypotheses and also do some data manipulation in Python. Because of that, we (well, I) need to communicate with them to get those jupyter notebooks that they have and send them to my team so that they continue the work of the previous teams &amp; start answering our stakeholders' specific questions. This is fine, I can do this as I already have a good relationship with the Scrum Masters from the other teams. ***Question:*** **Should the Scrum Masters/Leads from the other teams have a meeting with my team whenever an urgent request comes in so that they can understand the requirements? Or should I propose a meeting with the other Scrum Masters and explain the requirements once urgent requests come in?**

Now, in my team, we don't always get urgent requests from stakeholders. We also have longer-term tasks to work on, and we're doing our own statistical analyses, experiments etc. ***Question:*** **In terms of the Jira board, how can I most effectively structure it so that I can separate the long-term tasks vs the short-term urgent tasks? Should I keep some buffers for potential urgent requests? So because we always get spontaneous urgent requests we can't exactly plan in ""sprints"".**

***Another question***: **One thing that my Manager dislikes about how things are in the team currently is that everyone drops their long-term tasks and panic about the urgent tasks when they come in. She'd like more structure so I guess in the stand-ups I could explain the urgent task and ask who's comfortable working on it, and leave the rest to work on their long-term tasks?**

Thanks a lot for your help. This is really stressing me out as I'm quite uncomfortable (and new) in this role right now (and no, unfortunately there is no one else available to do this and I really want to help my team keep focused and organized).","Need of advice please - my main role is Data Scientist but due to circumstances I have to take on the role of a ""scrum master""/PM on a new project?",1602954491
