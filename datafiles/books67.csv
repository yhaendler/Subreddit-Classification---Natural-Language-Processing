Reading is one of the few things these kids have more or less unlimited access. I've donated some books here and there when I can afford it or when I'm done with a book . About a month or so I donated five or six history books .

The kids went nuts over them . They really enjoy learning about these important events and characters that changed the course of the world . Two of the books I gave them , Shiloh and the first volume of the rise and fall of the third reich , they really loved . I try to keep an eye out for cheap history texts when I'm out and about. But I live in a small town shit hole , so the pickings are slim . So if there's anybody out there who would like to donate some books . I know myself and they would be very grateful.  Christmas is coming up and I'm sure they would love a new book to read. Thanks again in advance! 

Really any books would be nice, but I'd like to encourage the learning . There are some restrictions on what they can read . But as long as it's nothing too incredibly sexual graphic or violent it's ok . Even , then there some that are allowed to read the more advance stuff.",Looking for possible donations for a group home.,1606693742

books,"I'm writing an essay about feminine critique of literature (specifically Helene Cixous), and I'm trying to make a point about the difference in writing of female characters by female vs male authors. I can't think of any books written by men to use, unfortunately. I'm picking people's brains needing suggestions for:

* a book where a female character is only desirable because of traits thats align with masculinity (""not like other girls"" trope)
* a book where the man is a bad boy/grumpy/aloof and the woman still finds it desirable and pursues him
* a book where women are written as inferior to men or characterized in general as weak/incapable/less intelligent
* a book written with men as the standard for women's behavior (like how doctors will diagnose women on the standard of men's symptoms for a disorder)

something I can contrast with Elizabeth Bennett in *Pride &amp; Prejudice* where she rejects Darcy after he interfered w her sister &amp; Mr. Bingley, or Zora Neale Hurston's *Their Eyes Were Watching God* and Janie's agency in her marriages. I'm having a serious problem where I haven't read many books by men in general so I don't have a lot to go off of.

books,"I used to read a lot when I was younger but lost touch with it once I started college. I’m now done with college and I would like to get back into reading. A book I read a child has been on my mind since I believe it belonged to a series, whereas I only read one book, so I would like to read the entire series if it exists. I just can’t remember the name of it for the life of me. I was wondering if anyone could help my identify this book? I remember quite a few details about it that might help, though it’s been over a decade so my accuracy may be off: 
• The book was told through the eyes of an illegitimate biracial child (can’t remember if it was a boy or girl, I want to say boy) of a slave owner and one of his slaves. 
• The book was obviously based in the past, probably somewhere in-between 1850-1940
• I don’t remember what state it was based in but I think I recall oranges (the fruit) being on the cover of the book so my guess would be Florida? It was definitely located in the American South. 
• I remember one of the repeating themes in the book was that the slave owner father struggled with his love for his biracial child and his hatred for slaves/black people. I believe I recall a scene where he had to beat his biracial child for some slave-related transgression but he was reluctant to do so. 
• I *think* it belongs to a series because to me, it seemed as if the book alluded to it. I could be wrong. 

I could be remembering details completely wrong but I hope I’ve gotten enough correct for someone to be able to identify it. Much thanks in advance!",Looking for help in identifying a book.,1606690180

I LOVE my career but I've also got interest in many other fields (like logic, mathematics and the like), in order to improve the quality at work, I thought it was going to be a good idea to start reading books on software engineering, software development, programming, mathematics and logic.

But if you ask me about it, I'm not able to fully explain what I've understood. I mean, I remember most of the stories in the book, I remember most of the content if I have to.

books,"In his earlier book, The Black swan, the author speaks of events that have huge impact, both positive and negative, albeit that occur very rarely.

In this book, he has put forward the concept of Antifragility. He quickly points out that robustness is not the opposite of fragile just as neutral is not the opposite of negative.
He says Antifragility is an upgrade on Robustness,that which allows us to not only withstand strain but even to gain from it. In doing this he clearly shows how Antifragility is the opposite of fragility ,which implies something that succumbs to strain.He says the greater the Antifragility, the greater is the ability to withstand Black swans, which are a high impact and very rarely occuring kind of strain.

My thoughts are that our ability to withstand these rarely occuring Black swans requires us to be able to consistently do what other people rarely do.

But the trick is in finding the actions that we can do consistently that is rarely being done by others, in a way that makes us able to not only withstand strain but benefit from it.",A discussion on Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book- Antifragile,1606661272

books,"Planning on switching publishers for my classic collection- for now they're a mess, different publishers etc because I got most of them preloved. 

I have about 3 collin's classic. But Bantam Classics recently caught my eye, they look good in shelves (I find Collin's Classic covers boring), but I'm not sure if the writing, intro background etc is okay tho. 

Which publisher should I buy from?

I am very excited as this book was gifted to me by someone who LOVED it! If interested, please DM me. I have a buddy read platform already set up, and I do them each month!

books,"Hello! I usually don't have trouble focussing on a book, but of late, I have had trouble even picking up stuff to read. And once I did that, I'm having trouble focussing. I get too distracted. I know I should be reading, but I'm not able to. I doubt if it's the book's fault, since the one I'm reading now is well-acclaimed.

books,"Hello readers and welcome to our Weekly FAQ thread!  Our topic this week is: How do I stay focused and remember more of what I'm reading? 

We've all experienced reading 10 pages of a book and then realizing that we haven't actually read it.  Or putting a book down and forgetting what was going on.  What do you do to try and counteract that?
