datascience,"Hi,

I have experience in feature engineering mostly in a manufacturing domain.

I’m not aware of any conferences or societies around this topic specifically.  Does anyone know of any or are interested in the idea of creating one like a Feature Engineering Society?

My opinion is that feature engineering is one of the most important and vast layers of data science and ML.  A conference like this would help to expand the knowledge and collaboration. 


Thanks,
Alex

The Data Science workflow starts with a business problem or objective that needs to be resolved. The data science team takes the problem at hand, and works through different stages to explore, clean and analyze the data to produce ML models that can solve business

1.   Data Cleaning turns the source “raw data” into a “clean” form. This takes a significant amount of time because most raw data is unclean, meaning steps need to be taken to improve the quality and develop it into a format that machines can interpret and learn from.

2.   Feature Engineering: Feature engineering is the process of taking a dataset and identifying explanatory variables  or “ features” that can be used to train a machine learning model for predictive analytics. Often, this involves merging data spread across multiple tables and gathered into a single table with rows containing the observations and features in the columns. This step is generally the most intensive part of the workflow, from a human perspective, as it requires a careful understanding of the problem and domain knowledge.

3.   Model Selection, Model Training and Deployment Model selection plays a crucial role in building good machine learning models. ML model selection requires selecting the best hyperparameters and algorithmic selection. A lot of model selection is now performed through automated software packages. Models are tested by exposing them to new data, providing an unbiased estimate of its performance.

4.   Exploratory Analysis Throughout the life of the data science project, the data science team will constantly sidestep from the main modeling pipeline to explore the data, try out various hypotheses.",Data Science Workflow - did I get this right?,1595201664

datascience,"I work in a small data science team (5-ish people) at a large, non-tech company. We work with very large data sources and have solid infrastructure, but the technical skills of the team are very low. The team is all data scientists (myself included) with decent theoretical knowledge, but minimal experience with good coding/development practices.

I've worked as a (junior) software engineer in the past, and although I consider my knowledge to be pretty modest, it far exceeds that of the rest of the team. I'd like to introduce better practies to my current team, such as code reviews and writing tests, but I've never worked anywhere that had a great approach to development so I'm not sure how to go about it.

We mainly work on projects individually, that are usually unique and have little in common, so there's not much standardisation that can be done. We use git, but basically just commit straight to master, and most of our work is analsyis rather than anything that's productionised. It's rare for multiple people to work on the same codebase and even rarer to do so at the same time. We don't really use development methodologies like scrum/kanban, as we mostly work independently so people just manage their own work.

Any thoughts on where the best place to start would be? I'm not sure where to begin given the nature of our work and the low technical proficiency of the team.

I am having doubts on how to approach the creation of the data set. Even asking the question is somewhat difficult to explain for me.

&amp;#x200B;

We have 250,000 clients, 1,500 churn every month, that is, approximately 0.6% per month churn . It is very unbalanced.

I have the data for 18 months, that means that I have 18 times the database of 250,000 clients (4.5M rows) and marked the 27,000 clients who have churned those 18 months (1,500 churn \* 18 months).

Of those 4.5 million records, there are many repeat customers, since if they did not churn , they will remain in the database the following month.

My question is how do I build the dataset. I suppose I have to select the 27,000 cases that churned as the class to be predicted, but how do I go about selecting the records for the classes that did not churn?

I was thinking of transforming the non-churn class to unique registers, but what register do I take? The last record, the first, random?

What other approach would youfollow or have you followed in similar cases?

The problem is that we often have a scenario where a piece of work will
involve multiple steps, they're to be delivered in a pretty short space
of time, and changes are often requested later on (""*_can you filter by x%
instead of y% for z?*"", or whatever).

What has been done previously is that an issue is created for a piece of
analysis and everything is done there - the problem is that it's really damn
hard to manage all the commentary / defining scope / seeing what needs to be
done when everything is in one place (imo). So - instead of this - each
subtask of a particular piece of a project is broken out into a separate
issue, each with a particular deliverable.

This makes sense - but where it becomes a bit trickier is when I might want
to be able to borrow a bit of code from one issue to another, if they're all
siloed this makes things harder to do. So, I guess I would want to merge them
into the ""main issue"" repeatedly, I'm not really sure though.

So - in this scenario I have something like

```
├── master
│   ├── analysis_project
│   │   ├── task_1
│   │   └── task_2
│   │   └── task_3
│   │   └── task_4
│   │   └── task_5
...
```

And I'm asking - if you were to do something along these lines how would you
approach it?

You could have a branch off `analysis_project`, and just use the issues on
github to document the work being done on the tasks, but not actually have
branches for them.

Or, you could have a branch for `task_1`, `task_2`, `task_3` etc and when you
feel the task is complete (or near enough ish) merge it back into
`analysis_project`? How would you handle changes to the tasks in this setup?

datascience,"Hi all, 

I hope I can clear up any confusing about my title with some background information on me. I have a bachelors in psychology that requires only college algebra, trigonometry, statistics, and research methods classes to graduate. 

I am now finishing my doctorate in human factors psychology (it’s an interdisciplinary field, think cognitive psychology and ergonomics). The program is based on experimental psychology so the statistics and research methods I learn is in depth. 

I have experience with large datasets, generalized linear mixed-effect modeling and linear regressions in R, ANOVAs, data visualization and data dissemination. I have practical human factor experience in a military research lab where I collaborated with engineers on technical problems. I was able to apply my behavioral science knowledge to design considerations and tweaked several algorithms in Python (I’m trying to keep this vague as possible since I signed an NDA). 

Based on my experience in the behavioral sciences, applying my behavioral science knowledge to real-world problems, and my in-depth statistical/research knowledge combined with programming experience in R, I believe I could be a major asset to a company in data science. 

However, I am concerned that due to my limited math coursework (trigonometry and college algebra) I will have to take more math courses. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated.",Field transition considerations from psychology to data science. Additional question about math coursework.,1595042527

Hey all! I'm taking Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera. Let me know if you'd like to be in a study group with me!

I know they have forums on their, I just figured more people use reddit lol

datascience,"Hi there, 

Maybe this is not the place to post this but here goes. I graduated last year from an MS in CS, and my degree was primarily focused on AI. Deep learning, machine learning, reinforcement learning, AI research, co-authored papers, autonomous driving, statistics, data analysis, I did it all hoping to become a data scientist. I did super cool and relevant side projects and research too. I have worked in AI for 4 years now. 

When I graduated I hardly saw any jobs for entry level data scientists. All these positions demanded a 15 year experience in data science which is ridiculous considering data science has not been around that long. 

I’m currently working as a software engineer now but I get rejected after first or second round of data scientist interviews because I am not working on data science full time, even though my job has some analytics work involved. Or they have a problem with my visa status which is F1 OPT. 

What do I need to do to become a data scientist? I feel like I’m not being given a chance even though I have all the qualifications. Machine learning is my passion and working with it gives me happiness. I find it hard to do side projects in AI because of the 40 hour work week. I’m just frustrated now. 

Really hoping for some advice. Thank you in advance.",Struggling to get a data scientist position,1595029431
datascience,"Hi data science reddit. My family is torn up fighting over my brothers recent career decision and I need your advice.

My brother is 30 years old. He is an oil &amp; gas reservoir engineer with 5 years experience working at Royal Dutch Shell. He’s about to lose his job because his sector/industry has been hit hard by COVID19 and as a result his company is going through a massive wave of layoffs.

For as long as I can remember he has been infatuated with computer science/ coding, and it’s always been a regret of his that he did not pursue this career path when he was younger. He doesn’t have any formal training or experience in this, although he is somewhat of an amateur coder (self-taught in python and some stuff like that) but I really have no clue how good he is at this stuff.

This lay-off has got him thinking about a career shift. His plan is to enroll in a 3 year undergrad computer science program and get a bachelors degree so he can become a data scientist.

My mom doesn’t support his decision to go back to school and they won’t stop fighting about it. I’m trying keep the peace between them and stay neutral, but I’m leaning more towards my mom’s POV. The idea of going back to school and starting his career from scratch as a 34 year old fresh grad looking for entry level work in data science seems radical to me, at the very least questionable. Am I wrong? Is this a good idea?

I suggested as an alternative that he enroll in a 2 year master’s program instead. I don’t know if this is a good idea either TBH but at least it would be 1 less year and it seems more practical to me that he pursue an advanced degree and possibly compete for more senior positions, given his age. But he seems to think that even if he earned a masters degree he still lacks the work experience to compete at a more senior level, so might as well get the bachelors degree. He also says that he wants to get a full education in computer science starting with the fundamentals, which he would not get from a masters program.

1. Is it too late for my brother to become a data scientist? (I know it’s never too late for anything and I’d love for my brother to follow his dream and all that, but if we’re being practical about this- is it too late?)

2. If not, what is the best way for my brother to break into this industry?

So I graduated with a degree in biochemistry and have gotten an interview with a software service company, they deal with Digitizing protocols and data from clinical trials to make information more easily accessible into a cloud-based database so that clients can get the information they need on results and procedures from this.

When I applied the description was looking for Biological Science graduates and states that any technical communication knowledge was a bonus, I am quite interested in the company however my primary degree is not in this area so was wondering if anyone could give me areas that I could research about to give me an upper hand? I have experience with clinical trials just not so much the technical stuff.
