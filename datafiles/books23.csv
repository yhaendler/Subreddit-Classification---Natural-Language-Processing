Here is its description:

Are you tired of politics?

Are you tired of the constant left and right, with one or the other forced on you?

Are you tired of an ever-growing government? imposing increasingly strict and opinionated laws, raising taxes, and making decisions for you and playing with you as if you are their property?

Are you tired of navigating through complex political beliefs, identity politics, and political faux pas?

Do you just want the room to be you? To express yourself, think for yourself, work with others and pursue your goals, without being thwarted, controlled, and violated? if I don't harm other people, Do I need to be controlled?

Can't there just be one simple way? Can't there be one simple, natural, system underneath the mess of politics and opinions? Can't there be a simple ideology that rejects war, violence, environmental destruction, racism, and deals with all of society's problems with no strings attached??

YES.

The profoundly straightforward yet easily digestible manifesto of individualism as a political philosophy, this book defines, describes, and defends the beauty of the individual, the right to their mind, reason, and values in an increasingly collectivist world. Seeking to eliminate the idea of individualism and capitalism as irrational immorality, selfishness, and refusal to interact with others, the book paints a picture of individualism as undeniable human nature as well as the source of creativity, ingenuity, community, and social progress, pointing out that any belief, idea, organization, or action is fully individualist so long as it is done in free will.

The author's debut as a political philosopher which he completed at the age of 15, and the declaration of his philosophy, this book outlines, structures, and defends Autarchism, the belief that individuals are the owners and governments of themselves and their property. The belief also commonly goes by the names of Anarcho-Capitalism, libertarianism, and voluntarism, which, in the book are described as a single belief: ""individualism, pure and without exception"". This book is to be a ""catechism"" of these beliefs. The book defends Autarchism in various new, simple, and inventive ways, influenced most heavily by Murray Rothbard's ideas on the state and property, Ayn Rand's ideas on relative values and self interest, and Max Stirner' ideas on the subjective spirit, as well as influence from him regarding the nature of property. This book also goes deep into the nature and anatomy of the state, and how it operates.

This book is a must-have for anyone who wants to learn of this ideology, defend or debate individualism and libertarianism, propagate libertarianism, have a deeper moral and philosophical understanding of individualism, libertarianism, Anarchism, or capitalism in general, or just to learn more about different political philosophies.

Shall we read and debate? I believe it was something like free or 99 cents on amazon.

She was wondering if anybody else has ever made their own covers of books. While she’s not trying to sell it, she was wondering if there are people who do. My question that she doesn’t know the answer to is, is this legal? Is there some sort of copyright that’s not allowed in terms of using the books name/image? I know many people make fan art and sell that image but I figured this was a bit different. Any responses from authors or artists who’ve designed books would be greatly appreciated! Even general opinions would be nice too :) for me personally, I tend to not like a lot of book covers so I usually don’t judge a book by its cover but more on the story itself. Though I am human and sometimes do because of how gorgeous the covers may be. Most of my hard covered books don’t have their paper covers on them because I usually don’t care for them, however if the cover looks cool or unique then I’ll leave it on. With the option to change a cover to be more unique I would definitely love to have them so that I can sell books that I love to others who come to see what’s on my shelf.

books,"So with the whole Covid situation I finally had the time to finish off the metro book series by Dmitry Glukhovsky. I jumped in after playing Last Light. Overall 2 of the 3 books in the trilogy are pretty solid and a good read. 

The first book is probably the best in terms of overall quality and consistency. Artyom is by far one of my favourite leads in any story. Not to mention other characters are also well done, most of them are. Artyom just feels like a normal guy despite the crazy circumstances. Other characters like Khan in particular stand out. The way in which Glukhovsky gets detail and description down makes you see everything down to the grime under fingernails. Moscow the city feels unimaginable large but cold, empty and dead. The metro tunnels dark and desolate. 

My only real gripes with the first book is that their really isn't any villains, like yes the Reich show up but you don't get too much time with them. The dark ones are of course the ""villains"" but I felt not enough time was spent with them or maybe a vision or two more would have made the ending much more impactful. It is still good but just needed a little more build up to the twist. 

Now Metro 2034, being honest not a good read. It was so slow. The plot took so long to happen and it all lasted about a chapter. However, Hunter and Homer are by far two of the better realised characters out of the series. Homer is just a guy I loved just for how he felt pure just a guy who wanted to tell a great legend. Hunter is just the embodiment of brawn over brains. One line that always stands out is when Sasha gives him a knife after he killed a monster thinking he saved her life, ""I only wanted to kill the monster."" Chills.  

Sasha however not so much, just something put me off her. Never got a good sense of her and just didn't like her that much not to mention where she went in 2035. I would recommend skipping this book but that hurts some elements in 2035.

2035 was a very different ride. I know one thing people rag on this book for is Artyom in that he is an unlikable man for like the first half. I actually liked this. Made him much more real, he isn't the hero of legends Homer wanted but a very broken man. However the sleeping with Sasha was too much without that maybe would have worked for more people, that is definitely a low moment.

The story for 2035 however was the most interesting for me. It took a while to start but from the first encounter with the Reich to the Red line and back again it gripped me. I love how everyone felt as though they had their own agenda and villainous people actually escaped and were cheered by crowds.

I think the ending is one that I will have to think about for a while. Yes, Artyom in a way wins, driving off into the sunset with his loving wife no one behind him, how Homer's legend would have it. But that isn't what he wanted he wanted everyone to go to the surface, have the curtain opened for the Metro but instead another sheet was thrown over their eyes for who knows how long. 

Wrapping up I would say read the first book at a minimum it is classic well worth your time. 2034 is very hard to recommend but 2035 is excellent so the choice is yours. Only other words of warning occasionally the writing can be a little off but it seems to be a translation issue, Russian to English isn't always the best combo. And if you are getting a copy of 2035 mine had a lot of typing problems like backwards speechmarks and a lot of them so be careful of that. Still not big problems more of nitpicks that any issues.

There are so many series like this, and I was wondering what it is about this genre that makes it so hard for authors to continue the 'momentum' that they got in the first book.

The aliens have very distinct senses, which the protagonist discovers in much detail. Possibly their sight or something with their tongues.
The events happen on the alien's planet. The point of the story is one of appreciation for completely alien cultures - the humans come as conquerors, and one of them learns to live with the ""natives"" (once he becomes one of them).

You have a large core of disaffected (resentful) and on the scene enters “The Man of Words” (Fox News) and then “The Man of Action” to give voice.  Juxtapose this to previous tandems.  Marx/Lenin in the Russian Revolution.   Goebbels/Hitler in the rise of Nazi Germany.  Many other parallels (and perhaps distinctions) to discuss.  No spoiler.

books,"I recently finished reading ""The Revenant"" by Michael Punke and one of my favourite things was the realism. How Hugh Glass treated his wounds, how he got food, how he survived, what the natural environment was, and how the Sioux Medicine Man treated him medically. I found that all fascinating. 

What other books offer a similar experience? Thank you for any suggestions.","What are some books similar to ""The Revenant"" that have detailed descriptions of real hunting/survival techniques? Preferably fiction but anything is good.",1587317837

books,"I am looking for resources which may deal with or discuss gender bias in the reception or reading of the Western Canon, especially in the case of classical texts. I would be interested in reading discussions of the way scholars – men – have read female characters or female-driven stories through the ages, particularly from the Enlightenment until the advent of feminist literary theory in the latter part of the 20th century.

I have personally been reading Ovid's *Heroides*, as well as criticism of the poems, and it strikes me how harsh the criticism of the literary devices employed in the work tends to be – in my view, possibly even harsher than if the speakers of the poems were men – even if the author himself is one of the most celebrated writers in history.

I find it extremely demeaning how men have said that the tone, presentation and form of the letters is too lofty or somehow unnatural for the subject matter, when that is simply the nature of *highly* structured elegiac poetry. I don't believe I have seen this critique as commonly applied to works were men are generally the main protagonists or speakers, for example in the major Greek tragedies or Homer, even if the cadence of those works is obviously no less learned than that of the *Heroides*.

Why has this critique stuck so to this work in particular? I ask myself if it may have something to do with the voices presented in the poems, as criticism seems centered around the issue of the verses being to eloquent or elevated to have conceivably come from the mouth of a woman, completely dismissing other merits of the work by reducing it to such a biased view, as well as sidestepping the fact that many great works also make use of this literary deceit. Not to mention the fact that elegiac poetry itself, with its carefully constructed verses, was deemed highly suited to lament and love, as Horace himself put it.

This puzzles me a bit, while fascinating me at the same time, and I would love to read more about gender bias in this context or in regards to the Western Canon in general. Are there some great resources out there that you would recommend I check out? Any hints would be greatly appreciated.",On Gender Bias in Reception of Classic Texts,1587317348

books,"i have no problem getting back into the book world like i used to when i was a lot younger. and now that i think about all of the things i've read, i've always been interested in novels that i related to, i guess. but i've changed a lot and it's a little harder to find relatable books now, i feel like.

the types of books that are interesting to me are informational stuff i can learn from, like philosophy, psychology, things i can apply to my own life. and even with fiction. if it helps knowing, i'm 16. i'm in high school and i like books about high school. but the drama never interests me. neither does romance, or anything. i would love to see a book about an independent high school student taking steps to build their own thing, i guess. and even maybe spice it up with it being a vampire high school? lol idk. i do like vampires and other more dark stuff in books, but still, not just anything.

i guess i like books that i can apply to my life, informational or fictional, that are pretty much useful to me in my specific life situations. i know, i am extremely picky. but i'm the same exact way about watching tv and stuff.",hey! would like some advice or input :),1587314763
books,"Last night around 9:30pm, I read an article in the NY Times about the upcoming Normal People tv show. It sounded interesting, so I looked up the book by Sally Rooney to get a better sense of what the show would be like. I read the sample on Amazon, then I bought the book. By midnight, I had read 2/3 of it. Then I decided to go to bed, finish in the morning. But I couldn't sleep, I couldn't stop thinking about it, I needed to know how it ended. By 2am, it was finished.

Since then, I've read some critiques of the book and I generally agree, it wasn't perfect. Things weren't fully developed or explained, and the style leaves something to be desired. But man, it caught me. The characters felt so real, their internal conflicts were so deep, and the repeated heartbreaks stung so badly.

I have never identified with a character like I did Marianne. So much of her rang true with me. Like feeling like a outcast and that no matter what you do, you can't fit in and convince people to love you. The feeling that you are worthless, unwantable, uninteresting until someone ""normal"" validates you, makes you feel like something about you may be valuable, simply by wanting to be around you. Or the deep and profound feeling of rejection when it turns out that's not true, like when Collum decides openly that she's not good enough to be his date for Debs, so much so that he doesn't even consider inviting her. Even years later, that sort of sting will stay with you.

She grows a lot in the book, but even in the end I see so many of her remaining flaws in myself. When she talks about Collum having in inner-life away and apart from another person and how she lacks that, how so much of her identity comes from who she is from being with him, man. Or how in the end, she is still willing to sacrifice so much of her own happiness so that Collum won't have to sacrifice any of his because, on some level, she still doesn't feel worthy of him sacrificing even a little of his happiness. Even though she no longer doubts his love for her, she still won't make demands of it.

I didn't feel that type of identification with Collum, but I've seen a number of other posters talk about recognizing his deep anxiety well before it became explicit in the book. That's something I haven't experienced myself, so I wouldn't have recognized it so quickly. But the fact that others did, and connected with that, speaks volumes about the realness of the characters Rooney created.

Which leads me to the ending. It was abrupt, it was disappointing. I think most readers were rooting for them to figure it out and finally be together in the end. And I choose to believe that they did just that. By the time Collum was accepted to the MFA program, they were pretty deep into the relationship. Marianne in particular was ready to accept long distance for a year, while internalizing the fact that things during and afterward may never be the same. So I believe they give long distance a good go. But it would be incredibly hard for them. As demonstrated by their tiff about Sadie, and also by the fact that Collum didn't tell Marianne about the MFA program in the first place, they still have a lot of communication issues. They can now openly say they love each other and be together in a committed relationship, but they have a lot more growing to do. But I don't believe that dooms their relationship. I'm hopeful that despite rough times ahead, the characters would grow together and maybe find their footing in the end. Or not. But either way, I thought the ending left a lot open for their future together.

Overall, I really loved this book. It's a simple story, the author seemed to have no interest in developing anyone other than Marianne and Collum, but I was fine with that. The real beauty of this book is getting to be immersed in their intense and complex relationship, getting to feel their pain and joy and confusion. Was everything resolved in the end? No, but that's not how life is either, so I guess I can live with that. Glad I gave it a read.",Normal People by Sally Rooney [spoilers],1587313723
books,"He was one of the authors who got me into Science Fiction back in my younger days (yes, I'm old). I remember the first time I read Midnight at the Well of Souls, I was hooked.

He was pretty popular in the 80s and into the 90s, but lately, I don't see any reference to his books anymore. 

In addition to the Well World books, some of his standalones are fantastic. And The Devil Will Drag You Under, Dancers in the Afterglow, The Moreau Factor... And his other series like Soul Rider and Rings of the Master are excellent too.

Also, I think the Dancing Gods books are excellent humorous fantasy, comparable to Pratchett.

books,"I finished it last night and really enjoyed it, but I’m certain that’s at least partly because I was a middle class white kid in the Midwest who came of age in the late 90s.  

This is probably the first book I’ve read set in the 90s since the 90s, and there were a few little nit picky things that felt out of place and which threw me out of the novel (a mention of Wikipedia before it existed, etc.). That aside, I don’t remember reading another novel with such a focus on language, and I really appreciated how well it fit together at the end (and clocking in at less than 300 pages).

books,"I got the 1938 Maude translation of War and Peace off of Abe Books. It looks great, it reads beautifully, the typeface is satisfying. But it's only 857 pages long, and I don't understand why it's short. 

Shouldn't it be twice as long? I don't want to waste my first go of War &amp; Peace on an abridged version.

More info about the edition:

It ends with the second epilogue. It's appearance is a red bound book with illustrations and silver lettering on the cover. It comes in a cardboard-coloured holder.

if you type ""War &amp; Peace - In Two Volumes Bound as One - Maude Translation "" into amazon you'll see the edition I mean.

books,"A little bit about me, I’m 34, married, 2 kids (4 and 2) English is my 2º language after Spanish and HAVE NOT read a book since I was 15. I was in high school and read Dracula. I liked it a lot and still remember most of it, loved how detailed it was when describing Count Dracula, the castle, etc. Since then, for a reason on another I’ve never taken the time to read a book from start to finish and I’m ashamed. 

I’ve been thinking on picking a book based on movies that I’ve seen, however my more wanna-be-intellectual friends laugh at people who reads stuff like Dan Brown’s books so I’d think twice about picking something Da Vinci’s Code as my first choice. Also, I’m not looking for something ultra long that’s going to take me forever to finish. 

I know it’s not a lot of details but whatever comes to your mind as a potential first choice Is going to be much appreciated.

books,"I had read so many good things about **The Way of Kings** and was kind of sceptical when I bought it a year ago. I always wanted to read though but I kinda forgot about it until 2 weeks ago. Because I heard so many good things I didn’t want to raise my expectations so I just went in open minded just trying to read the story without any prior knowledge or background.

Within my first reading session I became so captivated and I couldn’t stop reading and I don’t what it was. Now I finished the book and I still can’t describe what it was. This book is phenomenal on a personal level and I’m not fully sure why. I mean it’s clear that the writing is fantastic, the story is captivating, the characters are incredibly well written and the scenery and setting are so fleshed out that it feels like you’re actively taking part in these people’s lives.

But on a deeper level this book kind of hit me and I’m not sure how to describe it. All of these philosophical discussions and topics (e.g. **Surgebinding**) made the story very humane and also very relatable. I mean all of the struggles that the characters have around accepting themselves, accepting responsibility, making choices, the struggle between good and evil, finding one’s identity and the constant changes due to the passing of time further emphasise this. This made me feel empathy towards the characters especially **Kaladin** and **Adolin**, who both have to deal with great tragedies influenced by their upbringing and the nature of their parents. This book is incredibly special and I don’t think I have the exact words to describe why.

Maybe I’m looking to deep into this but this has been an experience that I never had when reading books and it results in this mixture of nostalgia, questioning life and it’s experiences and having this reflection towards ones actions. I’m absolutely amazed on how **Sanderson** wrote this because the story doesn’t seem that complex but in the end it conveys so much. When I first started the book, I didn’t have any expectations but now I can confidently say this has been one of the best if not the best read of my life just based on the emotions that the book brought up in me .",I just finished The Way of Kings and I’m at loss for words,1587310324
