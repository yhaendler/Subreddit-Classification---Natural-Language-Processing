&amp;#x200B;

I read the Maude translation (edited by Mandelker) and it took me almost three months.

Before starting I did a fair amount of research into which translation to read. The consensus seemed to be the P&amp;V translation is the best however I found some websites doing side to side comparison of paragraphs from the book and really disliked the way the P&amp;V sentences flowed (or didn't flow!). I found I had to read them slowly or repeat sections to catch the meaning. The other consensus opinion is that the Garnett translation is poor which I agreed with from the sample paragraphs.

My favourite was the Briggs translation however I chose not to go with it for two reasons, (1) it does not contain any French, (2) the soldiers speak in cockney slang. I read some samples of the cockney slang and it really grated.

Therefore I chose the Maude translation (edited by Mandelker). It has retained the French and the flow of the sentences were only a tiny bit behind the Briggs.

I was happy with the translation and would recommend it, it was a joy to read - p.s. Amazon's ""look inside"" feature is also a great way of comparing the translations.

&amp;#x200B;

Spoilers below:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;!spoiler I loved the opening chapter. I normally find it quite hard to start a new book as I have to read about people I don't know therefore am not invested in. However the introduction of the characters at a social gathering giving their opinions on Napoleon's latest actions and other gossip instantly hooked me in.

When trying to decide whether to start the book I read a review which said the book has the worst opening line of all the great novels. I definitely disagree with that. The opening line and opening scene was a really unique way of introducing everyone and reminded me of the scene in the film Reservoir Dogs where the characters are introduced by giving their opinions on whether waitresses should be given tips. A great way to get a quick understanding of each character.

&amp;#x200B;

The characters are all so interesting. They are all so flawed. They do such stupid things. This makes them seem so real.

I fell in love with Natasha.

I sympathised most with Pierre - my favourite character in the book. His constant search for meaning, his epiphanies where everything almost made sense only for the understanding to slip away. He was always well intentioned, always incompetent.

I really disliked Prince Andrei, he was so cut off from life for no good reason - I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and give him a shake.

Poor Sonya is such a tragic figure - but at the same time I didn't feel a great deal of sympathy for her. Was her meekness off putting to me?

Marya was also a tragic figure - when Nikolai compared his feeling for her to his feelings for his finger I found it very sad for her.

I wish Vasili &amp; Anna Pavlovna Scherer had played a bigger part - they were both very interesting characters.

&amp;#x200B;

The sections on philosophy of history were so turgid, mainly due to repetition. Tolstoy would make a point and give an explanation which I would normally find interesting / thought provoking. But then he would keep repeating the point in slightly different wording for paragraph after paragraph after paragraph. Sometimes this would go on for multiple chapters. It was completely unreadable due to the repetition. I skipped the whole of part II of the epilogue.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the battle scene maneuvers were difficult to follow. Then I found an amazing series of battlefield descriptions on youtube. The understanding I gleaned from these videos really made the battle scenes in the book much more enjoyable, especially Austerlitz and Borodino. The great redoubt, fleches etc all made complete sense after the videos.

This is a link to the playlist [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUOc2qodFHp-mOphKW9RzQLsFTt-IV9RY](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUOc2qodFHp-mOphKW9RzQLsFTt-IV9RY)

If it doesn't work just search ""Epic History TV"" on youtube and go to their Napoleonic Wars series.

&amp;#x200B;

When I told a friend I was reading the book she said it must be very heavy reading. But actually it is the opposite, it is a very light read. The plot moves along, it is rarely dull, there is always some new drama or event to invest in, the characters are progressing. Keeping track of the characters was actually quite simple. I created a family tree sheet and referred to it initially but it doesn't take long to remember who everyone is.

&amp;#x200B;

It is hard to pick a favourite part of such an epic book but if I had to choose it would probably be the time period between the battle of Borodino and the flight of the French from Moscow. Occupied Moscow was so vivid coupled with Peirre's hair-brained scheme L'russe Besuhof. Also the firing squad scene was very moving and Peirre during the battle of Borodino was hilarious.

I also enjoyed every scene with Denisov - he is the sort of guy I would try to befriend.

&amp;#x200B;

I also loved the Christmas scene where the Rostov's take a sleigh ride to their neighbour - something about that scene was so magical and idyllic. It makes me so happy to remember it.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't buy the ending when Natasha falls in love with Pierre. I could believe Natasha making a decision to marry Pierre for money/security/stability/emotional support or any number of rational reasons, but not fall in love with him. Despite all she has been through Natasha is a very attractive woman in terms of looks and personality. Pierre is unattractive in looks and personality (he is a 'nice guy', he is the type of guy that Natasha and other women would like as a friend but not romantically). It is a bit of a Disney ending for them and it didn't feel real to me. The fact of life is that attractive women do not fall in love with unattractive men (nor vice versa).

&amp;#x200B;

Why did Natasha turn into a reclusive fat housewife in the epilogue? This also seemed unbelievable to me. She is an attractive women who is aware of this fact, likes being attractive and greatly values her looks. She is also an extrovert. The 180 about turn from her whole character seemed to clash with the women I had loved so much in the preceding books. It didn't seem like the same person.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love there to have been a sequel charting the life of Nikolenka Bolkonsky and the Decembrists - he is a character with such potential for a storyteller. I wonder why Tolstoy never progressed with that since it seems that was the book he originally started to write before it morphed into War and Peace. Perhaps after the emotional and physical investment of writing War and Peace he had to move on with his life to a new project.

&amp;#x200B;

I have got a copy of the 1966 Soviet film. In some ways I look forward to viewing it as it has great reviews and I want to continue my War and Peace experience. But in other ways I am reluctant as my mental image of all the characters will disappear when I watch it to be replaced by the film actors.!&lt;",Spoilers: My Thoughts on War and Peace,1582572516

books,"I'm an omnivore regarding how I consume books.  I read physical books, I read on a Kindle and on the Kindle app on my phone, and I listen to a fair amount on Audible as well, but whenever I am thinking of starting a new book I face the decision of which format is right for that specific title.  I have a few general criteria, and I sometimes choose right, but other times I find myself wishing I'd picked a different format, and I'm wondering what criteria others use to make this decision.  Here are a few examples of how I've decided in the past.  

**Why Does E=mc2? (And Why Should We Care?)** by Brian Cox

I picked the Kindle edition because I was going to be actively reading it and wanted to have it available on my phone for convenience.  My only issue has been that diagrams often don't appear on the same page as the text that refers to them, and its not as easy to page back and forth from the image to your current page with the Kindle.  In retrospect this might have been better in a physical format.

**Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid** by Douglas Hofstadter

I picked up the massive physical edition and don't regret it.  I'm writing in the margins of this one and working through it slowly. 

**Song of Ice and Fire** by George RR Martin

This was complicated (and expensive).  I started with a cheap Kindle collection of the whole (so far released) series, but found myself struggling a bit with the wordiness and fine detail of some sections of the first book, so I picked up the first audiobook, which helped get me back into it.  There were times when I wanted to read, not listen, but I couldn't sync my audio book with my collected kindle edition, so I ended up buying each individual title again as I progressed through the series.  In the end this was the ideal way for me to ""read"" these books, but it took a while to figure that out.

**1984** by George Orwell

I went with the Kindle edition.  I don't find myself wanting to make notes nearly as much in narrative books, so the convenience of Kindle / Kindle App was perfect for this depressingly powerful book.

**It** by Stephen King

Again narrative, so Kindle was great, but I did get a deal on the audio book, so I listened to a fair bit of it as well. 

Right now I'm thinking about reading Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl and I'm wavering between the convenience of Kindle and the ability to easily mark up a physical copy.

But with a mediocre book you keep reading thinking it's going to get better but it doesn't. It's not a terrible enough book to rant and rave about.

My favourite writers include Murakami, Pamuk and Hemingway, so based on what I have read stylistically Borges should be up my street.

books,"Hi. I love satirical works of all kinds, Raphael Bob-Wakesburg's recent book **Somebody who will love you in all your damaged glory** was mostly on point, with some experimental stories that missed the mark for me. 

I adore Kishon's work, particularly Unfair to Goliath's serious satire of particular events.  
Now you know me a bit, I would like to understand this book. I enjoyed the high concept, syntax stunted ""Unprotected"" story, as it was whimsical, but very unfunny still, more dramatic. Also the story ""Dog missed connections"", here we have a wonderfully dark, twisted and almost plausible satirical mirror onto society. Not overdone, surreal and quite dark. Delicious.

Then we get to the ""Magical Mr Goat"", which had no point at all, other than to feature a horny anthropomorphic imaginary friend. Not a joke to be found, aside from the peculiar absurd for the sake of being absurd. I'd love to appreciate this kind of humour, as for instance, the story in Raphael's book, ""A Most Blessed and Auspicious Occasion"" I find to be genius in its satire of marriage, as well as how insanely funny the whole goat slaughtering/shrieking chorus side of things are. 

""Occupy Jen Street"", again, seems absurd for the sake of it. The subtext of the whole thing is made painfully clear at the end of the story, but satire should not need explication like this. In fact, the whole story is bizarre but not in a good way, why would a person demand a person date them? It's not hitting any metaphor or any deeper point other than, me want you. You no feeling. Me want your skin. Nows.

Even if we take this further in works that are meant to be great, eg ""Guy walks into a bar"" I love the punchline at the end regarding the genie actually planning it all out. There's some high level story writing. But then, you're left to wonder, why did he grant the peace = geese wish then? Also, in that story, it is again, very painfully explicated certain parts of humour, as if the writer is assuming they're writing to children, regarding the pianist=penis, that is like, clear, but he must make the bartender actually say it? 

I'm very confused what to make of this writer, and would love some insight into how I can best enjoy what clearly so many people are enjoying. In short,I find his humour to currently be trite and over-explain to get its point across.",The Last Girlfriend on Earth (Simon Rich) I just don't get it,1582556004
books,"I read The Princess Bride for the first time last year. Having grown up with the movie, I assumed the sections of the grandfather reading to his sick grandson would be absent from the written story. It was (kind of), but it was replaced with something that, in my opinion, was so much better. 

For those that haven't read the book and don't understand how the format is different, I'll put the rest in spoiler tags. But if you enjoyed the movie, you really should read the book. 

&gt;!In the book, we find out that the story is an abridged version of a much less interesting story. As such, we are treated with 'author' notes about what was omitted and background about the 'author's life' about when the story was read to him and why he was even abridging it to begin with. I expected this to drag the story down, but, for the most part, it added character and charm that I appreciate as an adult. As a kid though, I can't say I'd be that interested. Which leads me to want to pull a ""The Prince Bride"" and omit everything but the fantasy story within the story when reading it to my own kids someday.  !&lt;  

So here's what I'm wondering: Has anyone ever pulled a Princess Bride, where they only read the 'story' parts of the book to their kid? And, if so, did your kids ever read it again when they were older and realize what you did?","Has anyone ever pulled a ""The Princess Bride"" with your kids?

books,"Hi all, I'm (27f) struggling to get trough the earthsea series. The story goes so fast and from 1 topic to the other. I just reached page 50 and honestly I just want to put it down. However, some books need getting into and take a while. This book has been recommended so much on r/booksuggestion that I feel I should continue. But maybe this just isn't the book series for me. I love HP growing up, I enjoy fantasy and magic. I am also a huge sucker for romance and WWII bookd about survival stories of jews and other people. That's maybe not related, but just wanted to mention this, as it might be relevant for advising to continue. Is this series worth continuing? I call this a 'readers block'. Mostly I'm just stubborn, but I often read a book I didn't enjoy through to the end and felt betrayed once I finished it as the end was just 'meh'. I'm currently on a week holiday with the worst internet connection ever and would like to read and enjoy the sound of the continuous rainfall on the metal roof of our rental cabins porch.

I promise I'm not going to do this for each character, but holy fuck. Some of you tried to warn me and I just scoffed. I wasn't prepared and this resulted in an unrealistic determination to mind meld with this character and hang on to every single word.

That resulted in a 10 page segment that took me well over an hour to read.

I know Faulkner is experimenting with stream of consciousness style of writing, but he must have sat there and thought:

*First lets start slow - by writing the stream of consciousness of a mentally disabled person - just simple thoughts.*

Then:

***Now let's fucking DIAL IT UP TO ELEVEN and do 100 pages of the stream of consciousness of a severely neurotic Harvard undergraduate student with family issues - WELCOME TO CHEZ THUNDERDOME DE QUENTIN YOU POTATO***

It's like we let r/SubredditSimulator run off and write a book. Take for example, this line (all grammar coped verbatim):

&gt;Hats not unbleached and not hats. In three years I can not wear a hat. I could not. Was. Will there be hats then since I was not and not Harvard then. Where the best of thought Father said clings like dead ivy vines upon old dead brick. Not Harvard then. Not to me, anyway. Again. Sadder than was. Again. Saddest of all. Again.

or this:

&gt;I'll want interest then dont let Quentin do anything he cant finish oh by the way did I tell Quentin the story about the man's parrot and what happened to it a sad story remind me of that think of it yourself ta-ta see you in the funnypaper  
&gt;  
&gt;Well  
&gt;  
&gt;Well  
&gt;  
&gt;What are you up to now  
&gt;  
&gt;Nothing

I keep finding myself yelling ""FOCUS, QUENTIN, JUST FOCUS FOR TWO SENTENCES, WHY CAN'T YOU JUST FOCUS - I DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS, I DON'T KNOW WHO THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING TO, PLEASE JUST TAKE A NAP AND PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER""

Its just enough coherence to be above utter nonsense, but not nearly enough for me (Faulkner's potato) to legitimately follow. But you *have to read every fucking word* because Faulkner just casually drops these Hansel and Gretel breadcrumbs of story line that are necessary to continue assembling this fucking jigsaw puzzle of a narrative.

I thank you all for enduring this rant. As much of a challenge as this has been I am proud(ish) that I've made it this far and have enjoyed the book, and it means the world that you've let me share the experience with you, and I've much enjoyed hearing your experiences as well - because it makes me feel less dumb.

Growing up, we had a lot of differences and one was that I was reading all of the time and she did not read at all. She's literate (lol) just didn't want to focus long enough to read a full novel. She's read 4 books so far this year, which is more than I have!

So far she's read a few books based on movies that she had seen and wanted to read, or were recommended to her by friends. I was hesitant to recommend to her a fantasy novel because she used to make fun of me for reading them... Then she asked if we could read a YA urban fantasy novel together (The Night Circus)!!!


She started reading it before me and so I asked her how the novel starts. 

My Sister: ""The book starts and it's really cool... Like, you're a character. They say: 'your scarf is blowing in the wind.'""
Me: ""What? OH!! That's called first person!! ""

books,"I've been reading zorba the Greek for a few weeks now, and while at first it seemed to be an argument for living a more active life away from the library and philosophy, it only seemed to get more hostile towards the latter idea as time went on. 

The message is heard loud and clear, but at the same time it feels a bit hostile towards me simply for taking the time to read it. I keep getting this mental image of a jock walking into a library and telling everyone to flex their arms instead of their brains before throwing this book at them when no one pays attention. 

It portrays the main character, a bookish sort trying to find meaning in philosophy and books, as a man without any answers no matter what he tries to read. Meanwhile the titular character, Zorba, who is a down to earth man of food, drink, sex and hard work has most of the answers, even if he doesn't know it it. And even when zorba asks our point of view character for the answers to questions he himself does not know, without fail, the bookworm has nothing to offer.

It's frustrating not because it is a bad story or a bad message really (If you can get past the sexism), but more so because the entire book feels like it is telling you to do something else.

I'm not even  finished with it yet, and more then any other book have I found myself debating whether to put it down or read on in spite of it.","Zorba the Greek, the only book that has told me to put it down and do something else.",1582549825
