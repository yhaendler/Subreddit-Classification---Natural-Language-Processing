books,"I just finished [The Five: The Lives of Jack the Ripper's Women](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37545347-the-five). 

&gt; ""At its very core, the story of Jack the Ripper is a narrative of a killer's deep, abiding hatred of women, and our culture's obsession with the mythology serves only to normalize its particular brand of misogyny...The victims of Jack the Ripper were never 'just prostitutes'; they were daughters, wives, mothers, sisters, and lovers. They were women. They were human beings, and surely that in itself is enough.""

This book reminds me a lot of [The Devil in the White City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21996.The_Devil_in_the_White_City). They're both exceptionally well researched, and beautifully written, with less focus on murder, and more of the lives of those who had been murdered. The Five was written to bring to light the lives of the women Jack the Ripper killed. Rubenhold did not go into detail about the details of the murders, nor did she focus on their murderer at all, which I appreciated. This book is simply the stories of the lives of these women and how they got to be where they were when they died, painstakingly recreated from public record and interviews. Rubenhold takes great care to document the known details of these women's lives, and admits frequently that there are parts we just can't know. These details often contradict what was previously written about these women, and I think she does a good job of explaining why she thinks those old details were wrong. 

I highly recommend this book, especially for someone who enjoys reading books about true crime, if only to see the victim's side of the story. That said, the overwhelming feeling I have after reading this book is sadness. Sadness at the cycle of poverty, and specifically how that so negatively affected these women's lives. I would love to hear from other people who have read this book, and get your thoughts on it.",The Five: The Lives of Jack the Ripper's Women,1589931716

I found the characters quite interesting, and it was a nice breath of fresh air with the inclusion of older main characters. Ralph and Lois were a great couple and a great team, and were further helped by Clotho and Lachesis. 

There are a few annoying things about this novel for me. I know King likes to include a lot of detail in his novels, but this was kind of a stretch. It could definitely have been trimmed down a hundred pages or so. Although the climax of this book was fantasticly done, I was waiting for it for about 750 pages before we got to it. The stange additions that King throws in might turn some readers away, but I found these ideas captivating and mostly attention-holding.

My rating was 3 out of 5 stars. I would recommend it to anyone who has a lot of time on their hands. But don't be entirely fooled by its daunting length. Most parts of Insomnia were very well done!",Finished Insomnia Last Night,1589927819

Unfortunately, the last \~100 pages were sooooo bad I don't understand how anyone can give this book a 5 or even 4 star review. It might sound odd to say it ended too cleanly and that too much was resolved in the final \~100 pages. Maybe this an unpopular opinion, but I didn't need to know the origin of the thing on the ice and I don't think it would've weakened the book in any way to leave it unexplained. I read plenty of books and watch plenty of movies in which you have suspend your belief, and the origins of a lot of bizarre phenomena are left unexplained. It's not a weakness or leaving a loose end to not explain the origins of something. Crozier shacking up with Lady Silence was another point I didn't like. I knew someone would end up with her- though I didn't guess him until after Irving's death- and it just ended too cleanly.

books,"For example. I have always loved Alice in Wonderland. The movie, the series, the idea of all of it. So much so that I finally sat down to read it. And with all due respect to Lewis Carrol, it was a very difficult read. Single sentances that went on for half the page, nonsensical transitions, hard to follow narratives. I understand that this is partially what made Alice so special - that it read like a dream (or acid trip) but still was not really a fun ride overall.

However I am finally reading Treasure Island and dispite the language (old writing has always been hit or miss for me), I find myself enjoying it quite a bit. I cannot wait to finish this one!

books,"I may be in the minority where the pandemic hasn't dampened my enthusiasm for dystopian/post-apocalyptic literature. In fact, I've been reading even more of it. Although our current situation is nowhere near as bad as what you usually see in these books, given that we've all had to go into lockdown, be wary of strangers and be isolated from friends and family while watching the world spiral into chaos, it does bring a certain level of...relatibility.

So I wanted to recommend some lesser-known apocalyptic novels I've read recently and over the years. I'm going to skip books like The Stand, The Road, Swan Song, Station Eleven, Alas Babylon, I Am Legend, Wool etc etc. We all know about those. I want to discuss the hidden gems or the lesser known wonders. Or books that you just don't see talked about all that much on this sub.

1.  [Riddley Walker by Russell Hoban](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/776573.Riddley_Walker) \- While this one is a nuclear holocaust situation, the main draw of the book is the invented language Hoban uses. It's a challenging book as it can take some time to parse what the characters are saying, but once you get used to it, it's very rewarding
2.  [Emergence by David Palmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2300.Emergence) \- Another one that deals with language being twisted up and transformed after the apocalypse. This time, it's a bioweapon and a world populated by a new breed of humans. The main character is also an 11 year old girl, which isn't something you see a lot in this genre
3.  [The Gone World by Tom Sweterlisch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33413556-the-gone-world?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=SrG2U3scKH&amp;rank=1) \- This one is really unique in that it's also a detective novel, and a time travel novel, along with an end-of-the-world scenario involving an unknowable, Lovecraftian entity haunting the Earth a couple of centuries from now. It really needs to be read and experienced as it's unlike any sf novel I've read in some time
4.  [When the Wind Blows by Raymond Briggs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/489946.When_the_Wind_Blows) \- This is a short, 50-page cartoon, a dark yet whimsical look at the apocalypse through the eyes of an elderly couple. It's really quite emotionally powerful and manages to say a LOT within its tiny page count
5.  [The Gone-Away World by Nick Harkaway](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3007704-the-gone-away-world) \- this one is weird, bizarre and batshit insane. It's kind of a wacky sci fi and magical realism mixed in with a post-apocalypse scenario where a superweapon has literally changed the laws of physics. There's a heaping helping of anti-conformity and anti-corporate messaging in here while still being hella entertaining and surreal
6.  [The Tripod trilogy by John Christopher](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101942.The_Tripods_Trilogy) \- this is an oldie but goodie. It's about mind-controlling aliens and a group of youngsters escaping and fighting back against them. Despite their age, they still hold up, and are very exciting, thrilling reads
7.  [Far North by Marcel Theroux](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4889214-far-north) \- a bit of a mix between Cast Away the movie, The Terror by Dan Simmons and hints of 1984, Far North is a bleak and brutal story that takes place in the colds Siberian wilderness. This book really makes you feel the bitter cold and isolation, and the unforgiving nature is almost the only post-apocalypse here. Great read 
8.  [Grass by Sherri Tepper](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104342.Grass) \- Apocalyptic fiction crossed with space horror, where a deadly plague that kills all plant life is spreading among the stars. Lyrical prose combined with some excellent anthropological detail towards alien species makes this an excellent read
9.  [Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang by Kate Wilhelm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/968828.Where_Late_The_Sweet_Birds_Sang) \- what happens if some of the last survivors of the apocalypse created clones to help them? This one has some interesting things to say about community vs. individuality, as well as new wrinkles on what it means to be human
10.  [Engine Summer by John Crowley](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1335568.Engine_Summer) \- A very strange book in that it doesn't have much of a plot and is somewhat emotionally distant. But man, the writing is absolutely beautiful - lyrical and immersive - and the narrative is a fascinating bildungsroman, as we see the main character grow up in a ruined world a thousand years after a cataclysm

I was bored the whole way through Robinson Crusoe. In both people are stranded on an island. They both have to figure out how to use the resources of the island to survive. The main characters in each even both end up with a servant whom they find to help them on the island. 
I think because in The Mysterious Island they have absolutely nothing when they land, it is more interesting to read of their discoveries than in Robinson Crusoe where he gets everything from the shipwreck. Robinson was on that island for the longest time and yet I feel like he didn't really do a whole lot. He wasn't even really trying to leave, whereas the castaways on The Mysterious Island were constantly seeking a way home. This drive to return made for more interesting plot points I think.

For me it was kind of an ode to life way back when the author, Frances Burnett, was alive. Sara Crewe may seem annoying and idiotic at times when she gets lost into her deep realm of imagination but when I read it, I just wanted the same thing. Her innocence seems to revel all around her and Frances does an impressive job of making it seem like that. Sara on the other hand goes on an all round kind and wonderful lapse often keeping me hooked to the book. The book was one of those ones kept at the backside of the shelf so its very normal I didn't read it at all during all the years I've been bored. It always seemed like one of those ""adult books"" that I'll get to know when I grow up so I can finally ""understand"" them. But its nothing like that. I know it seems like I've fallen in loops with the book but it really does that. And yes during the beginning I got bored. A lot. I guess the events leading up to her father's death were kinda boring. The real fun started after that when Miss Minchin takes over. Sometimes I did feel like stopping and reading another one but I couldn't. Ms. Frances does an amazing job of putting tracks and illusions at every corner to make it seem like the reader doesn't get bored.

books,"How many books have you read since the Start of May?

My answer: five.

If anybody is interested, here is my list : a french book on education written by teacher, ""Animal farm"" by Orwell, ""Discourse on the Method by Descartes"", ""Discourse on inequality"" by Rousseau, and ""The unbearable Ligthness of Being"" (one of the best books I've read this year) by Kundera. And you?

Currently reading ""Thoughts"" (""Pens√©es"" in French) by Pascal and ""The Way of Zen"" by Alan Watts.

Yeah, I read a lot of philosophy. 

I hope people can discover new books in this post's comment!

books,"*Slaughterhouse-Five* was the first book I had ever read from cover to cover. I mean that in the literal sense. I don't even think I had finished an ABCs book without an onslaught of boredom and frustration. However, reading Vonnegut was different.

The story begins with his life during World War II as a prisoner of war. Vonnegut was being held captive in a slaughterhouse under Dresden. As he is imprisoned in this slaughterhouse, Dresden is in the midst of being firebombed.  As Vonnegut emerges from the ashes of a fallen city he recalls how it looked like the surface of the moon. There was nothing left after the bombing. After Dresden, nothing was the same for Vonnegut, he needed to write a story about the bombing; however, he could never objectively tell the events of February 13, 1945. So he writes Slaughterhouse-Five. Vonnegut uses the phrase ‚Äúso it goes‚Äù on nearly every page. ‚ÄúSo it goes‚Äù is Vonnegut's way to describe the absurdities in this world and how humans must stay resilient in a world of chaos. I remember how much that idea scared me, but it also motivated me to make a change with the limited time I have.

After my experience with Vonnegut, I‚Äôve started reading everything I can get my hands on from *Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline to *A People's History The United States* by Howard Zinn. Vonnegut's words inspired me to be better, not just in the classroom, but in everyday life. I like to believe ‚Äúso it goes‚Äù can be applied to everything we experience from life to loss. Going to college is intimidating for me, but I know I can succeed with the right mentality. I will soon be leaving the comfort of high school but I can take solace in the fact that I made a lasting impact on those around me. I will always remember I can rise above the chaos.

I cannot stand any markings in my books, yet I do have second hand books with names or dedications written in them. Mostly because I couldn't find another copy of that book. 

I'm of mixed feelings whether or not I would like to have a book gifted to me have something written in it. Mainly because most books I've been gifted have been impersonal, and not really something I would like/read.

books,"I love to read, but I haven't been doing it much the past 2 months. I've been off work and have spent the time gardening and doing painting jobs in my house, and hanging out with my dog and cat. 

So I decided to start reading again....and couldn't get into it. I tried reading a Ruth Ware mystery and I couldn't stay connected to it. I finished, but it was a struggle. I tried reading The Iron Heel by Jack London, but I really couldn't concentrate on the long prose.

I got desperate and had to really figure out who would get me back on track. And that's when I started reading Kurt Vonnegut again. I've read about 5 of his 14 novels, and had invested in a complete set of all his books last summer. So I started with Sirens of Titan, since I've read Player Piano a few times already. It's like a balm, having an author hook you in again, making you cringe and laugh out loud. I ended up reading for 2 hours last night without realizing it. I woke up this morning wanting to read more, and knowing I won't get much of a chance until tonight. The fact that I'm looking forward to reading tonight tells me I'm on my way to getting out of this slump.

My advice: read a favorite author if you're having a hard time reading. Barring that, read some Vonnegut or Douglas Adams for laughs",Getting back in the habit,1589898192

books,"I finished The Buried Giant last night. Completing it made me feel like there was some depth and complexity I was missing, and I thought discussing it with others could shed insight into the pieces I was perhaps missing.

The beginning chapters focus on Axl &amp; Beatrice's relationship, and the couple is initially painted as caring very deeply for each other, highlighting Axl's gentle and intimate interactions with Beatrice. As the book progresses, the shift of the narrative puts the focus more on the conflict between the Saxons and Brittons, moving the story through other characters points of view, and occasionally focusing on challenges Axl &amp; Beatrice overcome on their journey. Then, after Querig is slain, the focus of the last chapter returns to the elderly couple. Although I would expect that the journey they just completed would strengthen their bond, Axl becomes very troubled by his relationship with his wife, and instead of playing the part of her champion, caretaker, and loving husband, he becomes a frightened and insecure with their relationship (Although in my mind its unclear whether he abandons Beatrice crossing the river, I believe he does not).

What is Ishiguro's point? What does Axl/Beatrices story ark tell us? And how does the Saxon's/Britons conflict tie into this point? The past / memory has ostensibly weakened, or perhaps even ruined Axl &amp; Beatrice's relationship, and has re-opened the Saxon/British conflict. Is Ishiguro is condemning memory?  This seems careless and unrealistic. I'm not sure what to make of the books conclusion and how the story is ultimately resolved.

I don't necessarily need a conclusion or a ""happy ending"" to be satisfied by a book, but I'm anxious I ""don't get it,"" or have missed the point Ishiguro tried to make.",Kazuo Ishiguro's The Buried Giant.,1589897424

It was a big colourful book of complex riddles set in a theme of wizards and warlocks. The illustrations were brilliant and the puzzles on each page involved hidden clues and codewords and so on. I *think* there was a pirate one in the same series (if it was a series at all). 

I used to loan it from the library as a kid back in about 1989, and it seemed pretty new to print then. It was probably aimed at the 16+ age group as the puzzles seemed very complicated to me at the time. it might‚Äôve actually been aimed at adults - it definitely wasn‚Äôt aimed at younger kids.

A question occurred to me regarding novels:

	1. What do you call that part of a novel where you are sucked in and ready to continue the book until its end? And what is the farthest you've gone in a book to get to that point?

	2. Similarly, what do you call that point where are you frustratingly put the book down and say ""I'm done with this. No more.""
