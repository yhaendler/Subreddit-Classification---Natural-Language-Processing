books,"Yes, another post on East of Eden by Steinbeck. I’m usually a Grisham slut but also like to explore. I’ve read a handful of Steinbeck’s other books and loved them, especially Tortilla Flat. I grew up in the Pajaro Valley and can relate to a lot of the settings in his books. 

East of Eden is a whole different level though. I think there are some things that you just have to experience in order to really, deeply, understand. Like having children, having real deep love, or having had someone close to you die. Steinbeck writes about so many different levels and experiences of humanity and his insights are just fantastic. And it’s not like he spends pages building in a particular insight, although some of them he does, but often it’s just in an off handed comment. 

I wonder how he acquired the experiences to be able to write at that level and convey all that he does in that book. Or maybe he’s just insightful and my basic premise of needing to personally experience some things is wrong. Either way, what a fantastic book. Seriously, what an honor it is to experience that and reflect on my own life. I’m afraid Grisham might be going by the wayside as I look for more meaningful books. Or maybe I should just go back to being a slut and savor the place East of Eden has without trying to duplicate the experience. I don’t know, will have to think about that for a while.",East of Eden,1608417496

books,"So yeah. This book hit me for almost the beginning. I grew up with with a mentally disabled brother only 14 months my junior and I know as a child I would have been thrilled for something to make my brother normal. I had a falling out with my family years ago so I don’t know how he’s doing, but I couldn’t help seeing my brother in early and young Charlie. Those elements spoke to me on a personal level. 

The latter half of the book when the deterioration starts kicking in also hit me on a personal level. As of late, due to my decades long struggles with diabetes, obesity and mostly depression, I have found myself experiencing some memory and cognitive decline. Since I was the normal child, I was expected to succeed and I was actually a fairly bright kid. For years I thought my mind was my only positive trait. It’s weird thinking of it possibly falling away. In general, it’s clear that the decline of Charlie and the fear and frustration is supposed to reflect fears people may have of growing senile or getting Alzheimer’s in the later stages of life. 

All in all, I don’t know why I waited so long to read this book. It was excellent",So I just finished *Flowers for Algernon* (spoilers),1608409396

books,"It's no secret that news media has become more short-sighted, anemic, and more often than not, inaccurate, for a long time, and this year has clearly proven that. I've been reading Stop Reading the News by Rolf Dobelli, author of the Art of Thinking Clearly and the Art of the Good Life, the reasons he gives out and the alternatives to news, long-form content such as books, podcasts, and long-form articles, are all actionable and make a lot of sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Dobelli himself practices what he preaches. He quit the news in the span of a week and has gone cold turkey for over a decade now. The reasons he gives ranges from how news is a waste of time and attention, to how it rewires the brain, to how it takes advantage of our cognitive biases such as negativity bias, availability heuristic, the Dunning-Kruger Effect, affect heuristic, and especially confirmation bias. A lot of criticism he has with news in its current form can easily apply to social media as well. Notable quotes: 

""Information given on the day something happens is necessarily basic and inadequate. And in fact, what we want is context and consideration, which is what you get from books-even if it arrives a few months or a year late.""

""Ideologies are among the stupidest things our brains have ever produced. They are essentially self-built mental prisons. Ideologies are opinions to the power of ten; they bundle opinions, as it were, and constitute whole world views."" 

 ""Our brains are desperate for stories that make sense as quickly and simply as possible. Whether they correspond to reality is irrelevant. ""

""Online videos, however, are the biggest distractions of all, especially when they've got attention-grabbing thumbnails. Your brain struggles to muster the willpower not to click on them, wasting another precious few precious minutes. More than a few, probably, because straight away you'll be presented with another video. Then another. After a while, you'll glance at the clock and wonder where the time went, and then you'll think, 'Where the hell was I in my work?'""

If you know anyone with a news or social media addiction, this is for them. It's not a media studies book or a book on the history of the news media, it's a self-help book and it's a book that is easy enough to consume in one sitting. It's worth the read.

I am preparing by taking a practice SAT and words are coming in one ear and out the other. I have always been a quiet person growing up, so I typically read to myself, and in ways to try and find easier ways to read, I read out loud. 

I want to point out that with fiction, most of the time I read well. When I do read, it's typically fanfiction around video games or shows I enjoy - nothing else besides social media and forums.

My problem is my limited vocabulary and impulse to rush through passages. I want to read things quickly. I have read that many readers can read without hearing a narrative voice in their head, and I can't really do that. If I do, it's kind of speed up. I want to pick up a page and understand it quickly. I am slow. Even when I watch an informative video or lecture, I adjust the speed to x1.5 - x2.0. Sometimes I may need to slow down to fully comprehend things, and that kind of frustrates me. Is there a way I can overcome this?

books,"So long ago I watched the movie the ninth gate, and I like it because it was a mystery/detective that revolves around book research with an ambiguous ending that involved supernatural elements. So I was about to rewatch the movie again but saw that it was based on a book, and I thought to myself that the book might have more answers or clues about the ending. 

now the first thing I must say that I enjoyed the book, I loved the characters, the setting, the atmosphere but was let down by the climax. The book has a lot of these meta commentaries about the book itself and other authors in that genre. Like yeah, we do a bunch of cliches but we're self-aware of it, but it's still a cliche though. like the supposed villain explaining everything, he was doing behind the curtain towards the end and then blames the reader for connecting two apparently unrelated plots. 

Like the hole anjou, wine/dumas club storyline was just a Sherlock Holmes or Scooby-Doo level plot that was too anticlimactic in my opinion, and the whole devil mystery was just there to throw us off. There was nothing paranormal about it, it all can be explained rationally. like we thought because some characters from the three musketeers were making an appearance throughout the story so you start to believe that the devil stuff is real as well, but since we learn that it was all orchestrated by Dumas fan club to get a thrill. So is the whole satan thing, It basically some crazy guy that thought he can summon the devil but he fails, and plus we didn't get any foreshadowing for it throughout the story, except maybe that he was acting antagonistically towards the main character at the beginning of the book. 

I think it's GRRM who said it, ""If you answer a mystery, you answer it by adding more mystery in its place. "" (or something like that,) and there was none of that in this book. Yeah, we don't know for sure what exactly happened to the guy after he did his ritual, or where the girl with the green eyes come from, but it all doesn't really matter by the end. So overall I must say it was a bit of a letdown, but to end on a positive note I will say that the research that went to write this book was impressive.",Just finish the club dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte and I want to discuss it a bit.

Anyways, I'm not exactly swimming in money, but I'm in my early 20s and work part time in a ""regular"" job and I'm also making my bona fides so to speak as a freelance writer. Because of the pandemic, I've now been published somewhat regularly on a couple of sites (less regularly on others). One of them pays good money, and liked my work so much that they decided to raise my fee. So I'm earning even more money. And they don't mess me around with invoices so they actually do pay what I'm owed, which I know can be a problem for freelance writers.

As a book reader, this inevitably has had consequences for how I buy books. Like every bibliophile, I have a proclivity to splurge on more books, fiction and nonfiction, than I'm probably going to read at any one time. I live with my mum and let's just say my personal library is starting to colonise the house. 

So yeah, I like buying books. But as we know, for the sake of financial prudence and moderation , you have to constrain it. So I gave myself my own distinct book budget. For a couple of years it was initially £20 a month and I was strict about it. It couldn't go one pound above £20. But since I started earning more money, I actually have some disposable income, even after adding to my savings, I decided to reward myself by increasing my book budget. I felt generous with myself. 

No longer was it £20 a month; now it is £100 a month, or £50 every two weeks, as my ""regular"" job pays on a bi weekly cycle. So I could quench my lust for buying books for my own self-education, enlightenment and pleasure, and adding to my growing personal library (which I feel very proud of) while also not being out of control with it. Moreover, if I didn't use all of the £50 in the two week cycle, the remaining amount could roll over, if I want onto the next budget. Something that is particularly useful if there is a particular book I want that is expensive. But believe me, you can buy a lot of books for £50.

It does feel good, weirdly, to have your own book budget, and reward yourself by increasing it when you do something well.",Having your own book budget,1608384864
