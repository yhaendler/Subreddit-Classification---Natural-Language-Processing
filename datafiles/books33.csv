&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Such a well-known book, such a famous book, yet for so many i never knew of it, it came to me while wikisurfing about carriages, horse-drawn transportation and old london cabs.

&amp;#x200B;

From the get-go black beauty was a book that was intriguing, you know when you find a book you think you may like, but only end up reading a few chapters before getting bored of it and stowing it away, this book wasn't one of them, it peaked my interest.

&amp;#x200B;

So what did i find? an absolute gold mine of a book, lets look at this, shall we?

&amp;#x200B;

Anna Sewell, the lady who wrote 'Black Beauty' was born in 1820, at only 14 years old, she had an accident that injured her ankles, meaning she had to walk with crutches and couldn't walk for long distances, she developed a respect for something she had to use a lot, Horse-drawn transportation.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result throughout her life she had a respect for horses and carriages, and in the last few years of her life, 1870-1877 she spent her time at home writing her only novel

&amp;#x200B;

Her plan is easily seen at the beginning of the book

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;TO  
&gt;  
&gt;MY DEAR AND HONOURED  
&gt;  
&gt;MOTHER,  
&gt;  
&gt;WHOSE LIFE, NO LESS THAN HER PEN,  
&gt;  
&gt;HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO THE  
&gt;  
&gt;WELFARE OF OTHERS,  
&gt;  
&gt;THIS LITTLE BOOK  
&gt;  
&gt;IS AFFECTIONATELY  
&gt;  
&gt;DEDICATED.

The Wellfare of others being a huge theme of this book, it is an autobiography of a black horse named 'Black Beauty' at first she was a perfect young horse who was bought up to respect other horses and riders, the novel spans the time of about 12-14 years from when the horse was very young to where she retired to the stables, she gets mutiple names throughout the story and talks to fellow horses about their expierences on the road.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this book activated something within me, i've always been a person who thinks about the wellfare of others and animals, as a child i wanted to 'rescue' wheelchair-bound people from their wheelchairs, which to be frank, was stupid, being that the wheelchair is the amazing invention that improves the quality of life for many across the globe, but i was young and didn't know anything.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago i was in one of them sports shops and come across the equestrian section, you know when people say you can feel other peoples pain through an image or words? well i nearly gagged and felt an awful sensation in my month when i saw the *bits -* for the non-equestrian-inclined folk out there, the bit is the part of the bridle that goes in the horses mouth, i had seen many people riding horses with them before but seeing one in person, how hard it was, how thick it was, how could i horse have that in his or her mouth without great discomfort? then i walked away from the equestrian section and forgot it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Until i read Black Beauty, or more exactly, the chapter about beauties 'breaking in' where she first wore the bit, she described it as horrible at first, cold, hard, infringes on the mouth, just how i thought it would, but then she said she had to and she did, get used to it, much like how we have gotten used to having watches round our necks and stiff high shirt collars, but there again i soon learned that the bit is nothing to worry about, for there are far worse things a rider may make his or her horse wear, all described in this book.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me tell me another time, i was very young when i first saw a horse and carriage, a little trap or dogcart it was, but i saw something terrible, both of the horses eyes had been covered up with awful eye patches, i asked my parents and they said it was normal and for safety, to stop the horse from getting spooked by a car or his/her own cart/carriage.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This book again, touched on that, not only did it tell me that the 'blinkers' don't cover the entire sight of a horse, nor are they that uncomfortable for the horse, but still the horses brought it up as a concern in the book.

&amp;#x200B;

Then comes the whip, the sound of a whip flying through the air, and hitting something soft, is a sickening noise for me, mutiple times in the book, it is mentioned of how soft, and how hard some use the whip, some til there's blood, some so soft and the horse reacts, espeically for a well-trained black beauty.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember another time from when i was young, my parents had this horse, quite a large grey/white horse they called 'Hidie' pronounced Hi-dee, hidie was a mischievous horse, and i'm not sure why my parents bought her in the first place, i remember her as being maybe a carriage breed, strange, being that i've never ridden a carriage or horse in my life, but hidie was quite evil, one time she cornered me in the garden, another time she somehow broke into the house, once she chased my sister and caused her to trip and fall, causing quite a serious wound that hospitalised her, oh the irony, but thank heavens she did not end up like Anna Sewell, and she was impossible to control, and would resist all forms of headwear, and once broke out and we had to track her down, that's the horse that gave me the fear of horses, the relief was great when my parents sold her, i'm pretty sure the accident with my sister was the final straw.

&amp;#x200B;

It relates to the book, because throughout the entire book, it is mentioned that a bad horse is a horse that had a bad upbringing or was ill-used/abused, if hidie was abused, i cannot tell, that was many years ago, and it is quite possible that hidie has passed by now.

&amp;#x200B;

The book states quite clearly that a well brought up horse is extreamly obediant, and will serve his/her master without conflict nor violence.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the book, black beauty is sold and sold again and again, from her stables of birth, to a lord, to a london cab, to her stables of birth, and all of the horses she meets have stories to tell of ill-use, wether its Bearing reins, tail-docking, sharp bits, sharp and hard whips, black beauty her self saw a hunter get into an accident when she was young, and the hunters horse didn't make it.

&amp;#x200B;

How black beauty got handed down through society reminds me of looking on autotrader for used jags, i see the ones in great condition, that went straight from lord to trader, but then i see the wretches of motorcars, those that have passed from and to many people, stickers on the dashboard, peeling wood trim, scratches, cracked leather, damaged bodywork, windows, and the bane of anyones existance, failing electrics, it is a sad fact, that the same used to happen to horses, and much like motorcars, were sold on for cheap, for in the end, black beauty was worth no more then five sovereigns, but monetary value is not everything in the horse world.

&amp;#x200B;

One chapter describes the hectic streets of london, and the poor driving therein, really i do not think anything has changed, at all, nor have the driving styles, described is the 'steam engine' style of driving, where horses are driven first from the get-go and are constantly whipped, then suddenly halted, espeically common among younger people, as said in the book, who think horses are like steam engines, how wrong they are.

&amp;#x200B;

And how wrong drunk drivers are, that black beauty was, at one point, driven drunk by her master, got into an accident, which killed the drunkard master, and injured beauty.

&amp;#x200B;

books,"Just finished this. I could read Julia Phillips' description of the most boring person on earth and their very boring life, but I still wouldn't be bored. And to think this is her debut novel!

The way she has developed a set of 2-3 characters in each chapter, and then brought them all together at the end is nothing short of prodigious writing. Each chapter is basically a short essay, and is designed to give the reader a glimpse into the very simple, yet very complicated lives of an ensemble of characters.

The tangible connection between all of these characters is of course the disappearances of the three girls, and this becomes clear soon enough. But as you progress through the novel, the connections between human lives and lived experiences become more abstract. This gives the feeling of a massive build-up towards a crescendo, and makes the book practically unputdownable. 

The fact that the narrative unfolds in rural Russia, in the remote reaches of the Kamchatka peninsula, makes the setting very very unique. The depth of her research is so refreshing, and for someone like me who knows almost nothing about life in rural Russia, her eye for detail is illuminating. The tension between native and Russian identities, the palpable Soviet hangover, the clash between cosmopolitan and rural values - these are just three instances. All of these sentiments colour the storyline in the most fascinating way possible.

books,"I recently read her Broken Earth trilogy after a long hiatus from reading new materials (new to me not recently published). I cannot speak highly enough about the quality of her writing, world building, and character development. From the first page of the first book to the end of the final one I was totally engrossed in her material. I went to school for geology and I loved that take on how those seismic events shaped so much of the society and history. I've read a lot of fantasy over the years and she ranks up there with some of the best authors in terms of breaking away from the typical stereotypes you see in fantasy. Obviously this is just my opinion but I sincerely hope someone might pick up these books if they haven't yet read them. 

Now I'm going to get political for a moment. As I've mentioned I've read a decent amount of fantasty, and read most of the commonly recommended material you see on the lists of top fantasy books. Yet this book only made it on a few of these lists, and in no way do I feel it should be an obscure title. It was published many years ago and receive back to back awards, so it should be an established series. I was unfortunately not surprised seeing her comments on the issue recently. 

 “ In a racist industry trying to sell books to a racist public within a racist society? Come on. Implicit bias alone will make negotiations harder. There are overtly biased gatekeepers, too.”

I love reading, I love the escape fantasy offers, I love exploring new worlds and meeting new characters. However I would hate to think that I an escaping the issues in our society and missing out on the opportunities to meet more characters full of depth and complexities because they don't fit in with the accepted narrative.

I love the idea of tourist traps being these nexi of power. I enjoy the gods having these new incarnations that fit the modern forms.  Loved the ""new"" gods coming out. I sort of like the plot.

But boy that book has a bad third act. The ending of the book is just a total disaster for me. And the random interludes are just sort of silly. If you want to give us those details, why not just do it through the main narrative? And the protagonist kind of sucks. I don't know the dialogue never felt right either. And also there is no sequel. 

So I have two sort of questions here. First, are there any books that are commonly regarded as influences on American Gods? It almost feels like too good of an idea to be ascribed to this sort of middling writer. Secondly, are there any books that are like American Gods, but actually good? Not necessarily asking for new books, just wondering if anyone else was as intrigued with this idea as I was.

That might sound a little harsh, especially considering Mogworld was his first published novel. I’ve also heard good things about his later work, such as “Will Save the Galaxy for Food.” But as for Mogworld, it was like a pale imitation of a Terry Pratchett novel. It was competently written, with a few chuckle-worthy bits strewn throughout, but was otherwise perfectly unremarkable. 

I’ve played an MMO or two, so I understood the central gag of the whole thing, but even so it was just uninteresting and only occasionally funny. I definitely wouldn’t ever revisit it, or recommend it to anyone. 

Can anyone vouch for his later work? It wasn’t a wholly abysmal first attempt, and I feel like Croshaw definitely had the potential to improve. Not to mention he’s still being published, so he can’t have just stagnated.",Rant: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw,1591725594

The words chosen by the author are incredibly selective and beautiful and the magic might be lost in translation in my opinion. 
To give you an example, to refer to African Americans she doesn't use the word ""Blacks"" or the ""N-race"" word but goes on to invent a word -  कृष्णवर्णीय (Means of Lord Krishna's colour). Krishna is shown in several Hindu depictions as a dark skinned person.

Everytime he starts to run from being burnt alive, the  mob shouts and poke their sticks. Some people are lifting their children on their shoulders for them to clearly be able to enjoy the sight of a lesser human being burnt alive.
