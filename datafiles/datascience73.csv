datascience,"Hi everyone,

So recently I finished my contract as a business intelligence developer at a big company. While working at this company I was working on my masters of data analytics to become a data scientist. Now that my contract is over I can either go all in and finish my masters in a year. Upside is that I am living at my parents place and have low to no expenses.

But to be honest I’m not so certain about the whole data science path. From what I read on this subreddit it seems like the field is saturated with entry level data scientists and you need a graduate degree. If I have to wait a year to get that pay off I hope It’s still worth it. In addition, I am not too interested in power bi / tableau. I used these in my last contract and found it boring. But maybe that was due to the project I was on which was all high level project management dashboards. My last class I took in graduate school was about building data warehouses. I know this is important in data science but it was very dry to learn. Also, This is kinda related but I miss working in a team. This last position I was very isolated and had practically no help. I wonder if that is similar in data science projects.

I am starting to wonder if my explications coming into data science path were misguided. 

I really see two options. 1) Stick with masters and do the data science path. I am still interested in machine learning and ai. 2) Get back into software development. I already have a computer science degree and I like the versatility that I have there.

I finished undergrad in May of 2019, and took a job as a Data Analyst. During the interview my manager and other interviewers were impressed with my statistics and programming knowledge, as well as skills that I picked up while being a research assistant and an intern during my undergraduate years. Back then I thought I scored a dream job, and was really excited to ""study population"" and conduct ""statistical studies"".   


Fast forward to now, I have 18 months of full time professional experience, and some reality checks)   


First of all, I did three studies that involved regression models/statistical tests for program evaluations. The purpose was to derive interpretation, and not predictions, which I actually prefer to do! I used R for analyses and presentations, using Beamer slides/ dashboards for different projects. In summary, everything went great and I enjoyed such work.   


I sometimes get to work with predictive modeling team, which is always a blast, but it does not happen very often. 

However, 70% if my time I simply do reporting. For these tasks, I don't even bother going to R or Python, and can do everything with SQL. I find it so dreadful and dull. I personally do not see much growth in such nature of work. It came to a point where I just use stored/automated processes to come up with required tables.   


My question is: have you, experienced professionals, been in similar situations at the beginning of your careers? How did you escape endless dull reporting tasks and were able to obtain a position where statistical/sophisticated analyses were required for your work? Were you moved to a different team within the same company, or found a position in a different company? So far since April I was rejected from all positions that I find desirable. 

I would really appreciate any advice at this point, thanks!

I encourage them, but like, you wouldn't consider becoming an engineer without an engineering background, you wouldn't consider becoming a cell biologist without a biology background. I can understand someone working a job they're dissatisfied with wanting to change careers, and like I said, I encourage it, but I'm wondering where the idea of this being an easy thing to do is coming from, and a tad worried that some (but certainly not all) seem to have a disregard of the underlying math and CS.",It seems a lot of people want to get into the data science field without having the slightest idea of what it actually entails,1609158683

The function has about 100 - 1000 parameters and is non linear (but polynomial if that helps).

datascience,"Hello everyone! I’m a junior at UCB studying CS, but through my coursework in statistics and data science and reading up, I’ve realized that the role of a data scientist speaks to me a lot more than that of a software engineer which I’m currently recruiting for (recruiting for SWE internships since I’m a junior). I’m planning on taking more data related courses, and I was just wondering, how do I land a data science role after graduating college? Is it essential for me to have an internship prior to graduating in this field, and is it truly expected of candidates to have completed some form of grad school to pivot into such roles? TLDR: with a CS background, how do I pivot into landing data science roles? (not data engineering roles, but DS).

**BLUF:** Mostly the two groups I looked at seem very similar.

# Methodology

In addition to the two threads mentioned above, I chose two other recent threads ([c](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/kj9bmx/domain_knowledge_harder_to_acquire_than_dsml/), [d](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/kiy49m/what_makes_your_specific_area_of_data_science_hard/)) which had a lot of discussion and had similar up-vote levels to compare the first set of commenters to.

Using the reddit API, I extracted the commenters from each thread, removing ""\[deleted\]"", ""RemindMeBot"", and ""Omega037"" (who was mostly commenting in the first set as a moderator; I didn't see any other moderators using their mod tags in those threads).

I then used the reddit API to pull all comments and submissions for those users to r/datascience starting 35 days before and ending 5 days before Sunday, December 27, 2020 7:09:51.948 AM GMT (therefore excluding the comments/submissions from the original posts).

datascience,"Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that I would like to pursue a career in data science. I’m sorry if this post is redundant or violates the subreddit’s rules but I felt like posting may help gain a little bearing and hopefully be of use to others. 

It’s been 10 years since I graduated from university with a Bachelor's in Physics and Philosophy. Since then, I’ve worked in a variety of roles. I helped a professor work on book projects for three years (strangely enough they were business management books), I helped a plant biology conduct research for 9 months, I was underemployed as a grocery clerk for 1 year, I worked at a boring office job that was mostly data-entry for one year. None of them have had high-level technical skills. I have written Macros, formulas in Excel to improve certain processes though. There are gaps in my employment mostly due to me spending extended time travelling to satiate my wanderlust. I mostly felt lost because I didn’t have challenges or fulfilling pursuits. Data science does appeal to me now because I feel like it could be a career which I would find challenging, interesting, and fulfilling. For some reason, whenever I previously thought about any corporate office job, I pictured it being soul-sucking like the movie *Office Space* but I can see that given the right tasks and environment I could enjoy an office setting. And thinking back on previous jobs, I felt pretty happy whenever I was given any tasks related to data, particularly with cleaning and building spreadsheets in Excel. 

Since the lockdown I started taking online courses related to data science. I genuinely enjoyed Colt Steele’s SQL course and Jose Portilla’s Python for Data Science and Machine Learning on udemy and gladly sacrifice time spent watching Netflix to learn new skills because I feel like I’m moving in the right direction. Is this a good enough indication that Data Science is right for me? I realize there is a lot more for me to learn before I realistically have a shot at a lot of positions and I am undertaking my new learning with the expectation that it will not be easy or quick but may take years of sacrificing time to  master the skills required to get an entry-level position. 

This is because when in 10 or 20 years I’ll thank myself for putting in the time and energy now to get myself into a profession where I can be fulfilled, have an income where I afford the lifestyle I want, good job security and ability to adjust to market’s demand, retire comfortably.

Do I pursue an additional master’s degree?

datascience,"The adage keeps humming those who can, do - those who can’t teach. Yet, I’ve made so many contributions as a Professor for top journals. I’ve got four books out, published as first author 120 manuscripts, and have been in higher education since my mid-twenties in North America. I streamlined my career well and was quite respected for my expertise in data analysis and machine learning. I fail, however, to understand how I can do some consulting on the side. I’d love to do that, but junior positions don’t hire me, and senior positions look at my cv and think me overqualified? I have over 1500+ followers on LinkedIn. My scholarly work gets around - showcased by NASA and Springer m, several awards, and a substantial amount in funding (over 5 mill) where I led quite substantial teams for big data. But I have no idea how to play the jive to make myself visible for doing consulting. Any suggestions are most welcome. I wouldn't want to do it full time, I do love my job.

I'm currently building a portfolio that's half art/ design projects and half EE/ DS projects, but I'm not sure how I should be portraying everything.

As for the actual portfolio website, I basically have a ""Projects"" page with each project listed that links to its own page.  For the VR or graphic design projects, it makes sense for me to show visuals and the story of how I got to the end results.  For the more technical projects though, I don't know exactly how I should be making these legible.  I have like 10-40 page latex documents I wrote for each of the projects, but I don't know if it's worth linking each image to a page with a brief description that then links to the paper and the GitHub or if I should really go into detail on the website itself?
