datascience,"I am an ML engineer with a few years of experience.  I had a data science interview a few days ago at another company.  The job is at a fortune 500 non-tech company.




The interviewer asked a variety of questions.  I was asked a leetcode medium dynamic programming question, a simple string manipulation question, some pretty tricky math problems, and some pretty trick data engineering systems design questions.




I would say the hardest question was challenging, but appropriate for an interview.  But I felt like I struggled through the interview because my brain was in 10 different places.  One minute, I was in software engineering mode.  The other minute, I was solving math problems.  And the next minute, I was in devops mode.

Some background information got a joint honours degree in History &amp; Economics around in 2018. I managed to land myself in a data analyst role, which involves some python work but mainly Tableau and Excel.

I’m looking to do a master’s degree which starts in October 2021 in either Data Science or AI next year. The course does state ideally the candidate should have first-year level understanding in maths, ideally Calculus and Linear Algebra etc. I’m not worried about the programming side of the degree, I’m quite confident on that behalf, it’s the maths side that worries me. Just to give some context my degree, the economics side wasn’t heavily maths-based which was unfortunate hence my math skills slightly rusty. 

What would be the ideal route to get to first-year university level maths? I was thinking of starting sixth form (Late High School) and working my way to university level maths in a year.

For NLP and data ethics I have immense interest, but I don't have the relevant experience for backing it. I have 3 papers pertaining, on various levels, to bioinformatics.

I say that, because I have been ""unofficially"" offered to do masters in a field related to bioinformatics at a reputed european uni. But I don't know if I would be interested in it after the two years. Until now, I was doing whatever I wanted to so I tried many different fields, so should I aim for a general data science masters or a specific field? Is it too early to decide to specialise immediately after my bachelors(in CS)? I'm generally a very anxious person so this is adding to it.

I also have to think about where I'll be after I complete the masters. If I take this opportunity, would I be too cornered into bioinformatics or will I be able to bounce back to a more general data science career? I know it's futile to think about where my standing would be after I come out of a course I haven't even accepted yet, but I can't help it.

Portfolio: Yeah, check out my basic blog where you can peak my writing style and view how I conduct analytical projects.
Skills, Work history, ... blah blah blah


I started my search in August of 2020. By September, I had sent out 100 applications, invited to interview from 2. The first was a software company that provides SaaS for health clinics and partners with pharma companies to hit patients with ads before they go in for their visit. The second was a data science role that interfaced with physiochemical scientist at the EPA. Before pursuing data science I was a chemist. I was rejected from both after 2 weeks of interviewing, taking an assessment, and the whole nine. Passed over due to a ""lack of experience"". Hmmmm.... but wasn't that obvious from my resume? 

So my search continued through October. By the beginning of November I had sent out 350 applications. At this point, I was applying to Data Scientist, Junior Data *X* roles, and even Data Labeling roles. Yep, labeling data. So now organizations are considering an applicant with a Masters in Statistics, with 4 years of professional experience, and 1 year of experience in business analytics? What a trickle down fuck over. I feel sorry for those with associates/bachelors/wip college students looking for some professional experience. Unsurprisingly, these organizations that were hiring for someone to appropriately label data were eager to hire me. 

It's feast or famine out here. I as soon as I accepted a data labeling role, 5 other orgs inquired about my application. Suddenly I had several assessments to complete and interviews to schedule. Managing my schedule became a challenge.

Today, one of the companies I had my hopes set on rejected me. They sent their assessment with a last minute deadline. I stayed up through the night to complete it. In the interview, they had 0 feedback on the work I submitted. The rejection email was cordial yet empty with feedback. *""After much consideration, we've made the decision to not move forward at this time.""* Ahh, that fresh but all too familiar sting of rejection. I've been rejected from 103 applications, 4 of which were after a series of interviews/assessments. It's like building a tolerance to spicy food. At least I'm not huddle on the toilet with tears rolling down my face questioning past decisions.

My current offer, and the one I accepted, pays $50K. That is a $5K increase to my salary when compared to the roles I held before I had a masters degree. It will take at least 5 years for the ROI on my Masters to break even. If you've read this far, then you've likely dealt with something similar. Or, perhaps, you just like reading the entitled rants of others. At either rate, I will share my methods of dealing with rejection, and you might find them useful. Or not. 

Jot your thoughts down. Then head out on a walk. Remind yourself that your competence does not hinge on the acceptance or rejection of these organizations. I won't be brazen in stating that acceptance is not validating, but rather that seeking it is an unfulfilling ambition. I personally struggle with this. I began to pursue data science to seek autonomy in my analytical endeavors. Thereby I take my short comings as personal failures, or reflections upon the traits that comprise me as a analytical thinker. 

Continue to pursue problems that interest you. I truly enjoy coding projects and following what research I can in the field of NLP. This pleasure feels perennial, for now, and distinct from my career search. Ideally, I would like to find a role that consolidates this personal interest with professional interests. Though, it would seem that competition is quite stiff in this area. 

Talk to your friends, family, or internet strangers about the process. I am fortunate to have a small circle of friends that listen to my rants. Additionally cats/dogs are helpful as they are diligent listeners. Additionally, I enjoy lurking on this subreddit.

- By taking a sample of 100k customers precision is around 7%. Is it usually a bad value for churn models ? Again, there is no recall, but I expect it to be low as well.

- To me lift looks like a business metric, especially in a highly unbalanced dataset. Telling that your model performs 4 times better than a random model looks cool, but at the end if in the random model you get 1% churn rate, it doesn't seem really good, at least to me.

I do know whether it is me being too pessimistic here, or just ignorant on the matter.

I’m working on a project related to different types of retail outlets.  My company has several different retail outlet types and I’m trying to figure out what is the optimal mix for different geographic areas.  For example, people in rural areas may want more full-service outlets whereas people in cities don’t want to talk to anyone and just need store fronts for dropping off and picking up.   I’ve got a ton of data to work with, but I’m having trouble coming up with a model that will tell me what percentage of outlets in a given area need to be of a certain type.  Do you guys have any recommendations of different techniques I can look up to see if they apply in this scenario?  

Ideally, I’d give the model my inputs, and it’d tell me that the optimal mix in a certain area is 50% type A, 10% type B, 21% type C, etc.   

Something I learned about today was that of Data Envelopment Analysis which was interesting, but I don’t think it applies in this.

datascience,"Warning -- venting ahead.

I'm new at a datasci job that I generally like and have spent a couple of weeks on a very heavy data wrangling problem in Python where I basically am taking some very ugly data distributed across multiple sources, and doing lots of magic with it that builds a pipeline that ultimately yields a single postgres database running from a docker container, all of which will scale, will be really easy to use, all done using Jupyter so everyone can use it, including a db schema visualization within Jupyter. Now when anyone in the future wants to rebuild the database they basically just have to hit a button. Also there are lots of utilities to ensure db integrity (basically lots of tests built in).

In my presentation my crowning achievement in my mind was that you could literally hit one key and the db immediately is reconstructed from scratch, while I'm talking. So as the thing is running and the db is being populated during this live demo, and I'm beaming with pride. The main boss person is like ""Great what are the results?""

I fucking died inside. That *was* the result for this work period....ugggggg.

datascience,"Hey Datascience!

I have to get this off my chest with a community where they could hopefully understand my concern.

Yes, you read the title correctly, I make full time income on the sports betting markets using applied mathematics and data science principles with the help of Python. I have over 9000 bets that satisfy the law of large numbers in the range of my taken odds (probabilities of matches and taken/""buy"" prices), so comparing to my ""Monte Carlo simulation"", my actual profits are in line with the calculated ""Expected Value"".

The thing is all of this was done by researching what other, mathematically proficient people done in this area (mainly on Google Scholar), and closely following their findings and tutorials, I copied their methodology to Python 1/1 (adding a couple of  twists that has something to do with the source of the data more, little with the mathematics itself). And it works...

First off, I remove the so called ""bookmaker margin"" with a so called, ""Newton-Raphson iteration"". I literally just copied what the author does step by step to my Python script (**translated it to Python is the better word btw**) as a function and it works. When I look at the complicated equations upon Googling what it is actually, I can not understand jack-sh#t...

The Monte Carlo simulation?? I watched a Youtube video explaining it in theorical terms, it felt like something totally unknown, while I made it simple with Python, randomizing wins and losses according to the ""true"" probability and compared that to my advantageous, +EV odds (prices) and that's it...

**But I do not want to do this forever, I would like to get a normal, legal job in the data (science(?)/analytics/base) field but I feel like an idiot for not knowing actually what I am doing fully, but it works... **

I literally just follow what other researchers, more mathematically competent people do/did, and do like a soldier without questioning the underlying logic, translating the findings and equations to Python  and letting the software do the job for me. As I have a hard time understanding them, I just ""replicate"" the steps the author uses, if he states it. If he doesn't, I keep googling until I can find the method/equation in a ""step by step tutorial.."" 

If I would like to get my foot in the financial data industry, not necessarily as a scientist, but as an analyst, is it enough **if I somehow just ""get it because that is how it has to be done"" or do I need to have a strong ""elevated"" mathematical foundation with deep understanding to be successful... ?**

I have an business/econ degree btw, studied Calculus and Stats, Probability Theory, but despite the fact I am making a living using the last two, I am certain that I could not pass the exam today.

Thank you for taking time to read it, and I am not doing this to be bragging or anything. I would like to hear genuine advice, because I have a hard time speaking about this in person as few people take this kind of income seriously (they think that I am lying), and those who do can't say anything about it...","I make a full time, above average income using applied mathematics and data analytics combined with programming but I can't really understand what I am doing.

datascience,"I’ve started another DS role in the last 6 months. Training was about 1-month long, which I appreciated, however, it was virtually all domain knowledge. Useful and I wouldn’t have opted out of it. But DS specific knowledge was entirely skipped. 

Once I got assigned to my “AI Production team” things started feeling off. The company offers one product, which is pairing call center agents with customers to prevent churn. They don’t do anything else whatsoever. So I figured if all you do is one thing, you do it damn well. 

I came to find that the “AI” code base is 10 R scripts. Each script is 500-1000 lines long, and there are usually ~10-25 comments per script total. No doc string equivalents or anything. These scripts reference each other with a shocking lack of documentation.

This isn’t the end of the world, surely I’ll be partnered with someone experienced and we’ll tackle a few toy problems together, like tweaking an ETL pipeline or something. Nope. Pretty much, “We’ve got a new client, please adjust these scripts as necessary, and ping me when you’re done.” 

In this economy I really do feel grateful to have a job and don’t want to lose sight of that. But I’m curious, what have others’ experiences of corporate code hygiene looked like? Is my experience pretty standard, totally bizarre, etc?

But I have no idea how I could model this. Doesn't even have to be machine learning.

But what I learned about price elasticity was the simple formula for 2 different price / sales volume points and only in theory, never with real world data.

For now I just:

* took all sales
* grouped by sales price = X
* X *  sales volume = total revenue.

But are there better things I can do? I would guess that trends / seasonality would have an impact so that influence should probably be removed but how? It's not a time series problem per se so time series things (normalization etc) or models like Prophet wouldn't work I guess?
