datascience,"Hi all, I'm writing a series of posts on Medium about an AI project I've been working on that aims to create an AI bot that plays the game Othello. Currently, my bot does not use any ""real"" models like neural networks, however I have still implemented logic for an AI to play the game. I've made some histograms to show how often my AI clients wins in 40 sets of 100 games against a bot that plays seemingly randomly, so it is absolutely data collection and analysis. 

In the future I hope to implement some sort of reinforcement learning model that learns its own strategies instead of hard-coded ones like I currently have. The post I have currently is about how I built the game, with later posts to come regarding the actual AI development. If you want to check out the post and/or repo here's the links!

datascience,"Hi, 
I've had questions I couldn't find answers online to, recently. I'm not sure how to design a model I'm thinking of and I feel like there's zero guidance out there about software practices with modeling in mind.

I'm mainly interested in forecasting so those are the examples I'll use.
In most large Python projects, you'll find that inheritance is used, for scikit-learn or statsmodels, there's a maximum likelihood estimator or a BaseEstimator from which other classes will inherit and then it grows from there with additional classes when it's required.

I found another project where [they are using composition](https://github.com/MBrouns/timeseers/blob/master/src/timeseers/timeseries_model.py) instead and it makes more sense to me, each model is the sum of its parts instead of the end point of an inheritance scheme. 

Then I realized that I couldn't find good practices or at least pros/cons of software development for statistical models.

So I guess my question is what do you do in your job to keep the code clean and maintainable and how do you build the architecture of such projects?

datascience,"I'm  not even sure how to pose this question but it has to do with finding  inconsistencies in large data sets (relational tables). For example  (hypothetical), one table may cover the layout of a supermarket between  2018 and 2020 and the data is collected on a daily basis; one column may  include the location of a certain shelf (denoted using a code from 001  to 999). Another column may include the category of the products offered  on that shelf (for example, Canned Goods), and yet another may show the  revenue produced by the products on that particular shelf on that  particular day. What may happen, however, is that one day the store  manager decides to place some other set products on shelf number 004  thereby changing its category. I am not notified, nevertheless I can see  the date when the category on location 004 changed from x to y. The  manager may also add another shelf numbered 1000 or he may switch two shelves (i.e. their categories) or even remove certain shelves.

I  am wondering how I could check for such changes in a table that has  over 1M rows and around 30 columns. Going through the table row by row  is not going to cut it, I've tried various methods using Excel, Power Bi  (particularly power query), but I am looking for some neat algorithmic  way of doing this, preferably using SQL or Python or R. Ofcourse if DAX  or M had these capabilities that would be even better.

I  have all the current data regarding the layout of the store, but in  order to utilise the older data from two years ago, I must be able to  spot any changes. Otherwise, I am unable to derive any useful insights  from this data as its supposedly constant parameters are actually  changing from time to time.

I have also hands on experience with supervised Deep learning. My statistics knowledge is also very basic (took Khan Academy course to refresh my undergrad Statistic class) . 

I have worked for 6 months as Reaserch Assitant in germany at department of Materials Engineering where I used K means clustering to segment different phases of material deformation under high stress and temperature. They just provided me the data in csv so I don't have experience with pulling from cloud or anything. Apart from that my master thesis was in Molecular machine learning where I used molecular binary representation (Fingerprints) to predict flash point which was not that accurate. Currently I am improving my SQL which was rusting since I finished my undergrad 5 years ago.

I have been consuming this sub for quite some time and It seems I lack quite a-lot of skills. My Maths for Data Science is also very limited. I am thinking of going through ISLR book and program some ML Algo such as Linear Regression with basic python components.

My confusing is I don't know where I stand in terms of employability. Should I go for a Data Analyst position or look from Junior Data Science? What I need to learn to have a higher employability?

Many machine learning algorithms (e.g. random forest) calculate a probability that a given observation belongs to a particular class (for classification problems). Usually, the threshold for this probability is 0.5 (e.g in a binary response problem: if the probability is greater than 0.5 it belongs to one class, if less than 0.5 it belongs to the other class). 

Modifying this probability threshold can sometimes significantly improve the performance of this model.

For the random forest model (using R), i tried to research a way such that different values of this probability classification threshold be also taken into consideration during the (k fold) cross validation grid search procedure ... but I couldn't find anything that exactly matched my requirements. So i spent a few days and tried to write my own function in R.

Could someone please take a look at it and let me know if its mathematically correct? I posted the link below:

datascience,"Hi. I'm an undergrad who's currently taking a gap year (I've already completed my freshman year as a CS major and am now in the Class of 2024). I became very interested in data science/machine learning starting this summer, and have taken/am taking several online courses on the subject, as I've really tried to immerse myself in the field. 

I now find myself in a weird situation. I'm not yet experienced enough to have done meaningful projects, and am still in the process of learning the methods and the tech stack needed for producing valuable ML work (even though I do have some background in the basics of statistics, ML algorithms, and programming/computer science). However, at the same time, I've often felt lonely and in search of  meaningful work beyond self-studying Python/R/stats/ML on my own. 

Does anyone have any advice as to how I can get involved with a team working on a data-related project as somewhat of a beginner to the field? I know that is a very tough question, since  organizations will rationally opt for experts with years of experience and advanced skills over college sophomores who won't be able to produce  the same high quality work at the same speed. Thus, I understand if the answer is simply to keep on reading, learning through online courses,  participating in competitions, and working on personal projects. I will of course keep doing all of those.

However, I would really appreciate if anyone had any insight you think might be helpful to me. Specifically, I'd be very grateful for any pointers as to what resources I should look into for remote, unpaid data science-related teamwork opportunities/projects that might be available for college students like me without years of experience.

I've already looked into things like the DataCorps volunteering projects at [https://www.datakind.org/](https://www.datakind.org/), but I probably won't be qualified for those for at least several more months of self-studying/working on projects.

To end the post, I should clarify that I'm not looking for an ""easy way out"" of stuff like learning statistics, probability, machine learning, and ML/DS tools in-depth (and instead going straight to actual work in data science). I thoroughly enjoy doing all of those, and I \*will\* obviously keep working on all of them regardless of whether or not I get an opportunity to work on a project/with a team.

datascience,"I'm working on a Credit Score project for our NGO in Africa, but I don't have much experience with Credit Scores. It's not a common thing where I'm from, so I hoped someone can help me with some advice. 

At our store, farmers can get cash or a product as a loan. After some time the farmer needs to repay the cash/product, but they are not always able to do that. My Credit Score model should be able to decide who's allowed access to which product, in order to minimize the risk of the loans.

I'm thinking of building a model that predicts if someone will repay or not, but I have a question about this: If a farmer is allowed to get a more ""risky"" product, he is less likely to repay, but the reason he was allowed to get the product was that he got a low default probability. Would this distort the model at some point? I can imagine that a good credit score model causes the probability to repay the same for both risky as non-risky clients, just because the non-risky clients are allowed to behave more risky.

Another question I have: Since farmers have the option for multiple products, would it make sense to make a prediction per product, or would you make only one model?
