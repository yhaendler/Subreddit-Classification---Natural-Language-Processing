datascience,"Hello, I’m currently in a undergraduate data science club and we had a chief analytics officer from a company come in and speak to us about linear programming and optimization. It was towards the end where I had asked him how optimization techniques could be used in predictive modeling and machine learning. He told me that the concepts he was telling us about actually didn’t fall under predictive analytics, but prescriptive analytics. The difference being predictive analytics is using previous data to predict new outcomes, and prescriptive analytics being using previous data to find what the most optimal solution is. That peaked my interest because thus far I have had a rather narrow view on data science with only predictive analytics and machine learning as my focus of interest, however I wanted to learn more about the prescriptive analytics side.

For those of you who work with prescriptive analytics, what are some math topics or sub topics that could help me explore this? I’m a statistics student and naturally my tendencies have gone to predictive modeling with machine learning, so I’m wondering what other math concepts would be useful for prescriptive analytics?

datascience,"I'm a Data Science Intern right now and this is my first ever data internship. I only recently started exploring the field so I'm pretty new to most stuff. I'm also not a CS major (STEM however) so you'll understand why this is brand new for me. I've been in this internship since Feb and honestly, I'm struggling and I'm not sure I like it. So to avoid a rant, I'll put everything into points:

1) My manager is focusing heavily on R&amp;D and most of my time is spent exploring new tools and new ways to approach the business problems. I know it sounds great but he's very intense and not easily satisfied and this vague goal of just ""exploring"" something is really messing with my head. Since I'm new to tech stuff really, it takes me a while to figure out things and we have daily update meetings where I just don't feel like I measure up. Is most of Data Science really spent on R&amp;D? And should I be asking for more direct tasks instead of vague stuff?

2) How do you get faster at coding and especially debugging? Cause there are so many ML concepts that I don't know and studying each one before implementing makes me slow and those daily update meetings are hell. And then debugging is whole other issue on its own. 

3) How long does it normally take to implement basic techniques? For example, I'm working on using CRFs for NER on a dataset I have. It took me two days to do this and I think my self doubt is magnified considering that my manager doesn't give me any positive feedback. 

I think the environment at this company isn't great at all and my manager doesn't like me as well. I could really use some advice on navigating this because I need a letter of recommendation from my manager, somehow.",Advice on how to navigate a DS internship?,1615306914

datascience,"I have been accepted to 2 master's programs in 2021-22 and need some advice on which one would make me more employable in data science.

I finished my bachelor's degree in psychology and business in July 2019 and have about 4 year's working experience in data analysis using both Python and R professionally. I have carried out data analysis for many projects using different techniques and feel very comfortable with the analytical part of data science, and have a strong background in statistics (my undergrad consisted of quite a few stats courses and I have taken some freestanding courses while working after graduation). I have also taken MOOCs on data science and SQL, but I know they're not alsways super impressive to employers.

However, I feel like in order to be taken seriously as a data scientist, my psychology and business degree doesn't really cut it. Therefore, I applied to some master's programs in order to get some more tangible 'proof' that I know data science. I've gotten into [Applied Social Data Science at LSE in London](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2021/MSc-Applied-Social-Data-Science) as well as [Information Studies: Data Science in Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/information-studies-data-science/data-science.html). I'm choosing between the two and don't really know which one to pick.

On the one hand, Amsterdam is a growing market after Brexit with an increase in jobs compared to London. The program there is also more focused on Data Science specifically, and not the intersection between Social Science and Data Science (as is the case at LSE). On the other hand, the program at LSE is extremely competitive, with only about 6% of applicants getting a spot. This makes me think it might give me more access to employers and that they have better connections?

Since I'm not a professional working in the field, I thought I'd ask for help to see if anyone knows anything about Amsterdam vs. London as an employment market for data science, and if Social Data Science as a degree will be seen as an actual data science degree, or just preparation for using data science to study social science.

datascience,"You can revert code, but you can’t revert culture.

Technical debt comes in when you choose a limited, easy solution and then have to rework it down the line. It’s the result of prioritizing speedy delivery over perfect code.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) systems, in particular, have a special ability to increase technical debt - because of hidden feedback loops, for example. 

There are consequences to this, but most teams accept the fact that *some* technical debt will always occur. And they’re okay with it because they know they’ll end up fixing whatever comprises they may have made.

Of course, you actually have to fix those issues. If you don’t, your debt will incur interest and you’ll pay for it 10x eventually.

Cultural debt is much more dangerous than technical debt. Once you hire the wrong people, it’s very hard to “fix”.

For example, you can’t just reverse a lack of diversity by hiring more people from underrepresented groups if 95% of your org is already just white males. New candidates won’t want to join and they’ll have no reason to - you’re going to have to start from scratch and think about what inclusion really means to you.

The same goes with setting your values. It’s a really vague word, right? Your “values” is normally just a bullshit term that companies put on their career pages - very few are actually intentional about defining the type of workplace they want to build.

By the time you’ve scaled, though, and you have hundreds of employees across different global offices, you’re going to have a hard time enabling the sort of principles that you want to see. You can’t just implement a culture of “open feedback” if for the past 2 years you’ve been doing no employee surveys or sharing employees’ anonymous feedback with everyone.

Cultural debt is especially dangerous when your managers don’t have an understanding of what type of organization you are trying to build. Managers have a multiplier effect on the organization - it’s a 1 to N dynamic.

And when you don’t invest in your management, that’s when you really see the consequences of weak culture. Your managers are going to be recruiting, managing, and leading. They will be the fundamental reason behind cultural debt spreading (or not spreading if you’ve properly invested in your people).

Most times, cultural debt occurs because people think that it’s at odds with actually getting shit done. They dismiss it as unimportant and what happens is that your people don’t get the time to grow and learn. After all, they’re too busy in their day to day.

If only solving these underlying issues were as simple as a git command. But it’s not because people are [complex](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/how-kevin-scott-motivates-engineers) and messy.

And the best thing you can do to minimize cultural debt is to be very intentional about the organization you want to build right from the start.

Some extra information about me: I did not even finish my degree (Computer Engineering) yet (will soon), but have some experience in research\~personal projects. I'm very confident that I can tackle most business problems with reasonable deadlines. Also, I'm a reasonably good developer.

My question is: is it a bad decision to become a manager now? I intend to be very hands-on, but probably will be less. I love the idea of managing and love the idea of discussing ideas with PMs, participating in decisions and everything that comes with being a manager.

I fear that I'll have a bad time looking for jobs eventually, since I transitioned too soon. Is it realistic? Should I really worry about that?

I'm currently working on a project where I need to cluster thousands of search terms into journey stages, top level categories and potential sub categories. Do I need to cluster a certain % of the keywords and then train a log reg model? Should I base it on similarity between order and amount of words? Any tips, thoughts, ideas or previous experience would be greatly appreciated. 

If this is to be reused across different kinds of searches will it always need to be updated or can I develop it to work on at least a high level?

Since my primary job role is not doing ML work so I am not really able to prioritize this over BI stuff. But still I work on it from time to time. I use R and so far I have done some cleaning, ETA, tried different things with the data to see what modeling approach would be best fit. ML stuff is not really a priority in the team, it's just something we are trying to explore and see if it's even possible to predict something with whatever data we currently have.

datascience,"Hi r/DataScience! I originally posted this on r/ADHD but I figure you guys might be able to help. I was recently (re)diagnosed with ADHD at 29 years of age and have been on Concerta for two months now. I have gotten more done in these last two months than I have in the last 3 years. It is amazing, and I wish I'd learnt about this at 19, not 29, but I think that's a common theme for people with ADHD. I have since been shouting my recent discoveries about myself, and about the facts of ADHD from the rooftops! The world must know!

Since the start of Corona I've been self teaching python and data science, and after lot of self study and a data science bootcamp I have received an technical interview with an international company that works in the field of Mental Health research, and one of their goals is to build real world evidence databases to help in analyzing broader macro effects of mental health and treatment schemes. 

To say that this would be a dream job for me given the passion I have for what they're doing would be an understatement. 

I was given the task of creating a data science presentation on price determinants of public housing, which is old hat for me, so that's not the issue. 

However, I am considering a ruse: a data science presentation on the economic and societal effects of ADHD (not unlike the white paper [Making the invisible visible!](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.656.8883&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)) with as many data points as I can find

That's where I need help. A lot of the 40 or so research papers or articles I've found on the **subject of economic effects of ADHD** (Including many written by our much beloved Dr Barkley) are meta analyses or otherwise do not have strict data presentation the way I would expect an economics paper to have, and so finding their data sources on my own has been a very slow process. 

So: **Can you suggest to me sources of publicly available data that I can use to construct a presentation on the broad economic and societal effects of untreated ADHD?**","I want to go off script at a Data Science interview I have with a mental health research think tank to talk about the societal costs of ADHD, and I need your help!",1615170728

The firm has said they can't add any more technical headcount for a few quarters, so I can't wait for that to happen.

My game plan is to: sharpen my SQL skills, work/post projects on a blog &amp; connect with people on LinkedIn at firms I am interested in. This brings me to my q: I thought the new Google data analytics certificate might be a good addition to my plan. It looks to be $40/mo and afterwards I can use it as a springboard to connect with more companies through their Hiring Consortium. Does this sound like a waste of time?

datascience,"**TL;DR I want to write a thesis using data gathered through web scraping. The website I would like to scrape forbids automated scraping in its TOS. Considering the legal implications, should I quit now and choose a different topic?**

I'm new to this community, so I apologize in advance, if this post doesn't fit the rest of the sub. I also apologize in advance for my somewhat flippant approach to TOS/robots.txt rules – if this offends you, please let me know. 

I'm currently getting started on a thesis for my university studies (majoring in data analytics), and, out of personal interest, I wanted to build my thesis around a (relatively simplistic) econometric analysis on the effect of numerically-rated ""sentiment"" in product reviews on the total sales of that product. In preparing this idea, I toyed around with Python and built a web scraper that pulls review and sales data for products on AliExpress. I didn't originally put much thought into the ethical side of the data collection itself – I was more concerned with anonymizing and not publishing the review data –  so I completely ignored the fact that AliExpress entirely forbids automated information downloading in its TOS and robots.txt. So, I already have a working scraper, but now I'm getting cold feet regarding the legality of this endeavour.

Having looked at various online sources (e.g. [here](https://digitalcommons.murraystate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1071&amp;context=faculty) and [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305120940703)), it seems that while this is definitely against the TOS, the actual legal consequences are kind of a grey area. For one, the website does not have any kind of checkbox that restricts access prior to accepting the TOS, so the enforceability of the TOS is debatable. In addition, a number of recent American lawsuits have sided with the rights of the scrapers (however, unfortunately for me, I am not American). I've also found one seemingly-reliable [study](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28100/w28100.pdf) that openly admits to scraping AliExpress (with no mention of granted permission). There are also many more such studies about eBay, which also prohibits automated data gathering.

So, my question for you data scientists is: what would you do in my situation? Is proceeding with this not worth the risk (i.e. should I give up now, before I've sunk in potentially hundreds of hours of work)? Have you come across similar issues in your research, and how did you (or your company/university) approach it?
