datascience,"Before I get started - my reference for this approach to resumes is the Manager Tools podcast, specifically their episode cleverly titled [""Your Resume Stinks!""](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/10/your-resume-stinks) .

Every time the topic of resumes comes up, this community seems to go on a nose dive of beautiful resume templates with lots of clever use of whitespace, multiple columns, etc. And the problem is that they're pretty, but they are fundamentally not targeting what you actually want out of a resume.

A pretty resume that lacks content proves to an employer that you are either good at developing templates or good at finding templates, but it does not prove that you are good at your actual job unless your job is going to be to design resumes.

When submitting a resume, there are 3 things that you want a resume reader to walk away with:

1. That you have the necessary education and credentials for the job.
2. That the job you're applying for is a rational next step given your career trajectory
3. That you have delivered results everywhere you have been.

The corollary is that those three bits of information should easy for the reader to find on your resume. In order to address that, this is what is recommended:

1. Start with your work experience in reverse chronological order and provide both an overview of what your job responsibilities were and what your achievements were.
2. Finish with your education
3. Fill your resume with as many accomplishments as you can.

If I'm hiring someone to train and deploy machine learning models, I would like to see that this person a) has trained and deployed a lot of machine learning models, b) those models have delivered results, and c) that person has trained and deployed increasingly complex and valuable models.

The easiest way to convey that you have done something a lot is to have a lot of achievements associated with it.

Without further ado, the most boring resume template that hiring managers won't hate:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bo-F3m7dEU6sRshsUAX7GeuVWSQr65GHZ2FE4atCfio/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bo-F3m7dEU6sRshsUAX7GeuVWSQr65GHZ2FE4atCfio/edit?usp=sharing)

FAQ:

* Should I have a ""Projects"" section?

For people with work experience, I would advice against a separate projects section - instead include an achievement under an experience section that corresponds to what you were doing at the time. If you were a student in a masters program, put an entry in your experience that is ""Student"" and the things you achieved while there.

Why? Because it helps with continuity. It helps someone reviewing your resume understand when you were working, when you were in school, and when each project got done - it helps establish your trajectory. 

* Should I have a ""Skills"" section?

No. Weave your skills into the actual things you have achieved.

* How many pages?

One page for every \~10 years of experience/\~5 jobs.

* Do I do anything different if I am still a student with no work experience?

Yes - if you have absolutely no experience, then you would want to lead with your education and follow that with a Projects section. That is, if you have no career yet, then there's no point in worrying about a career trajectory.",The most boring resume template that hiring managers and recruiters actually want to see,1581710652

datascience,"Given a hypothetical situation:  
**1.** You are a new head of analytics team in a insurance &amp; banking corporation

**2.** You have access to all basic customer data from personal banking and insurance (transactions, contracts, investments, existing customer segmentation, risk profile, customer interactions...) but you do not know the content yet. You will have to request the data and justify why you need it

**3.** You do not have infomation about existing models or previous workflow ect

**4.** Your task is to find the most valuable potential customers for risk insurance (Health/unemployment/life) from the set of all customers. You have free hands. 

&amp;#x200B;

* How would you describe your workflow? What is the first thing you would do?
* What kind of models and tools would you approach the problem with?
* What attributes would you assume to be the most relevant in predicting value of a customer? What other hypothesis would you make?
* How do you think the potential value in the context different insurance types health/unemployment/life differ? The model should be probably specific for each insurance type. 
* If you had the possibility to try to improve analytics by appending the data from external sources (public statistics, social media, data banks, who knows), what would that be and how would you do it?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My very initial unprofessional and uneducated random thoughts:  
I would first somehow try to create one metric that considers the value of future cash flows of current insurance contracts &amp; the probability of compensation payments &amp; churn. Outsome is a simple estimated monetary value. Next I would try to find common attributes between existing insurance customers and banking customers. Third step would try to use these attributes to predict the value of a potential customer based on existing banking &amp; loan data of customers who do not yet have an insurance.

Lastly I would try to find other risk/opportunity factors and trying to figure whether these could be included somehow in the ranking or excluding them from the list. Outcome would be a list of customers to be given for the sales dept. For an example: 

* Should the customers with existing housing loans in the same bank be ranked higher depsite low estimated value / high risk IF the loan is not well backed by a liquid asset? This could be considered to be some sort of hedging for the bank itself in case of loan default due to unemployment/injury. Am I overthinking? 
* Customers with families are probably more likely to buy an insurance, thus acquiring them is cheaper and implies higher value (sources claim insurance companies have extremely high cost of customer acquisition). Problem might be that the customer data may not include data of family status (maybe this could be observed somehow from having common accounts/loans or regular outflows to other personal accounts?)
* Existing customer with high salary probably has higher value compared to similar customer with low salary despite same cashflows, because higher salary implies potential for new contracts
* One problem that comes to my mind is that I need to know what kind of risks are priced in the insurance payments already and how much. For an example, one could assume that old age and smoking are indicators of low customer value for life insurance. However, the age and smoking status are probably included in the standard pricing model and the total value can end up being the same.
* Some kind of customers can be more likely to churn IF they are being actively contacted. Maybe customer interaction data could be analysed using some kind of ML to avoid these cases

I may be overthinking and some of these probably goes way too much into details.

I am mostly a beginner when it comes to data science. Right now I play dfs for a living using essentially data analysis with just great excel skills.

datascience,,What Not To Do During a Technical Interview,1581609450
datascience,"When I first got into DS, I was exposed to the definition “Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.” 

https://twitter.com/josh_wills/status/198093512149958656

This definition is fairly well circulated. 

But I’m seeing a trend. MS programs, both stats and computer science are increasingly covering the other’s domain, especially MSCS. These programs have whole courses on probabilistic graphical models, stochastic processes, etc. And programs of both types are increasingly making it harder for an art history major to get better than a CS major at stats, stats major at CS, etc.

And so I think the bar for what makes a legitimate data scientist is raising rather quickly. But this trend isn’t permeating the self taught community. 

I see so many links for boot camps, online courses, books, etc that promise to get you entry level ready in x-weeks. But these programs tend to emphasize use of high level APIs like pandas and sklearn. They don’t emphasize learning the chain rule or eigen decomposition by hand, much less explain genuinely tricky concepts like Gibbs sampling.

I’ve been criticized for building things from scratch before. I made a logistic regression model from nothing but numpy and did the same for a simplex solver. The general sentiment was ~implementations already exist, why are you wasting your time? A proper appreciation for mastering the fundamentals is lacking in the community. 

Look at the digital nomad community, which by far concerns itself more with freelance web development than data science. These nomads learn enough PHP to get 2-3 freelance jobs then start making YouTube videos from a beach about “how I learned to code in Bali”. At this point, their revenue stream has entirely switched from freelancer to influencer... ie the dreaded pyramid scheme.

Data science isn’t quite in this situation yet, but it’s a possible future we should acknowledge. One reason this haven’t transpired is - the AI/ML/DS field continues to expand. On average google, Facebook etc release a game changing paper once every 2-3 years. And with state of the art techniques being a moving target, the fields AI/ML/DS haven’t been able to converge on a concise definition of what a data scientist should and should not be able to do.

This ambiguity has allowed for the hype train to gain considerable momentum. And in result, the availability of intro level learning materials have exploded. All it would take would be another AI winter for AI/ML/DS definitions to converge and in effect ambiguity to vanish, qualified paths to a DS career to be established, and the self taught path to be met with resistance and skepticism.

Because of all the DS hype we’re experiencing, the demand for DS is well beyond the supply. This lends itself well to making the self taught route viable. But once the supply catches up, employers will become more scrupulous in their hires, which will turn the self taught DS education industry into nothing more than a pyramid scheme. Getting industry experience ASAP is the only way to mitigate your risk of being “caught with your pants down” in this situation.

Some ways we can protect the definition of data scientist is by agreeing on the fundamentals. You need to know calculus, you need to know linear algebra. For stats, t-tests is not enough. Learn about parameter estimation, do it by hand on simple examples. Build things from scratch (which in turn forces you to learn DS&amp;A for efficient implementation.) 

This “ launch a career in 6 weeks by learning pandas” garbage is only going to hurt you in the long run. I have nothing against self taught DS, but you need to master the source material, not just familiarize yourself with the high level APIs. And don’t crap on people who are willing to put the extra effort in. MBA students know how to use SQL and pandas. You need to be better.

All these things are my opinion and I am interested in community feedback, especially (only?) those who have held DS roles for 2-3 years in industry.",Self taught long term viability,1581608294

ECT.",I have a question for a Project at work and could use some guidance,1581552792
datascience,Lads is it only me or is the data science market in Ireland really hard to get into? I work as a business systems analyst in one of the IT companies here in Ireland and even though the job is ok I am searching for another one in the data field. I thought it will be easy for me to get interviews at least because of my background but I am not getting any positive replies! Most of the companies are searching for 3+ years experience in data science. Also sometimes I feel recruiters prefer software engineers over data science graduates even though some of them don't have any background in maths/stats. Any suggestions to break the catch 22 game (experience required while no one offers you a job!) and secure an interview at least?? Thank you!,Degree in applied math and M.SC. in data analytics Ireland - can't get a data science interview!,1581547957
