Never Ending
Relationships.
As we grow up the relationships we develop drastically change, from the relationships we had when we were 7 to the relationships we built over time to the age we are now. There are many different types of relationships which people have, friendship being the most important to some, when others believe romantic relationships are the most valuable type of relationship in their lives. However the base relationship a person forms is with their family. The first person people see when they are born is their mother and the relationship you have with her is usually the most important, the importance of having a good relationship which your parents relatively decides what type of person you will grow into. What this means is in a lot of cases people who don‚Äôt have a father figure present in their childhood seem to have issues when they are older. In women it can be seen with abandonment issues, or women resenting men due to the damage their father has done, one example is walking out on them or in very terrible cases some people have abusive parents which leads to a lot of mental issues. In boys having a father which isn‚Äôt present or is abusive can have a range of different effects, in some cases not having a father can make someone very ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô as in a boys case they haven‚Äôt had a ‚Äòman‚Äô helping raise them.",I‚Äôm writing a book.,1597881007

I know it's a cliche but I'm being held hostage by my own mind.

**Who was the Caller?** I have read that some people see it as another of Jake's ""personalities"", but I just read a review that straight up called him a Red Herring and nothing else. Why/how was it coming from the girlfriend's own phone? Who was it after all?

**What's the deal with the emphasis on body parts?** I don't know if this is really relevant at all, but I can't stop wondering about the random pictures she found in Jake's bedroom (including ""way too many toes""), the mention of toe wiggling after they first sleep together, the mom's missing toenail? The girlfriend bites her nails as well. There's an obvious connection here, but why?

Some of the injuries or illnesses on others seem to make sense in regards to Jake's self, i.e., the cochlear implants and tinnitus in his ""mom"", the hair loss, lactose intolerance etc. The chemical smells the girlfriend was smelling is the janitor's cleaner... **why the constant metallic taste?** Blood? More chemicals? I can't figure this one out.

**Who is the girl/man in the photo she finds in Jake's room?** Was that the ""real"" her? With the blonde hair and blue bandana? Who was the man with her?

**Why did the parents change?** The dad started with one band aid and then put another one on, and the mom changed and also put a band aid on. Is this just supposed to show the inconsistencies and be a hint towards things not really being real? This is what I am assuming, especially when it says nobody mentions anything.

I can't wait for the movie, especially the Caller outside of the window, the ""what are you waiting for?"" part, and how they will change from the singular narration to we. I loved the whole end chase through the school too, I got some serious Silent Hill vibes.

I personally saw the ending coming - it seemed a little obvious to me with the italicized chapters, but I also liked them. Did anybody try reading it backwards? I tried doing just those sections both forwards and backwards, and it was interesting. What did you think?

books,"I have finally finished a long time todo item, reading George Orwell Ninety Eighty-Four (1984).

I have looked at some of the previous discussion of 1984 and felt very satisfied with reading those. So my topic for discussion is not the book in general, but rather the experience of reading the book... (I hope I make sense)suprising

The whole ‚Äúdouble‚Äù concept of Newspeak is so well presented through the book and its essence. I rarely have felt so certain about is doomed to happen while also feeling certain some plottwist will come.

That made me think a lot about the reason for it. Was it due to how well written the book was? Or is it due to how much the book have impacted our society and media? Was the plot suprising back in 1949?

It was overall a really pleasent unpleasent read.",Did you also experience ‚Äúdouble‚Äùprediction while reading 1984,1597856383

I won‚Äôt lie, the ending when he‚Äôs describing Phoebe going around on the merry-go-round and being happy really hit me emotionally. It‚Äôs a weird feeling, connecting with someone for the wrong reasons. I don‚Äôt identify with Holden now, but I definitely remember that feeling of the whole world being phony. Undoubtedly this is a love-it-or-hate it book and I think for me it stays in the love-it column. Who knows maybe in another 10 years it‚Äôll switch on me. 

I think the only way to enjoy the book and fully appreciate it is to recognize that you‚Äôre not really supposed to like Holden, he‚Äôs designed to be in likable and flawed. (Which is super telling about his own psyche since he‚Äôs telling the story from his own perspective)

Just this August, I bought myself the complete series as a gift of my first year anniversary being employed. I WAS JUST SO HAPPY WHEN I RECEIVED THEM THROUGH MAIL!!!

I have a strong feeling also that this series will be dear to me, as I already shed tears when Dumbledore said the thing about being loved, even when that person is gone, how that love will continue to protect us forever.

# Nightfall

When the Sun goes down, the world goes from its busy, live in the moment, lifestyle, to a quiet, almost dead atmosphere (depending where you live)....

The hard working sleep, while the nightime workers start their shift.

The normal people finish up their day, while the night owls start to really wake up.

At any moment you could listen and still hear cars on the street and people in their apartments doing anything but sleep, just like the alley cat that meows in protest of its hunger while that one nice neighbour brings it some food before going back inside...

But not everything that happens in the dark shrouds of the night is good or lawful, like that dealer down the street thats waiting for the buyer to bring him the promised amount of money for his...services.

Or that buglar thats getting ready to break into that house.

The night conceals many things, may they be good or not.

The night doesnt tell on people, it doesnt care for what its dark cover is being used...

books,"I'm in my late 30's, been an avid reader since elementary school. I didn't know initially, but I found out at some point that I read faster than average. Generally between 400 and 550 words per minute, or roughly 90 to 100+ pages per hour. When ""in the zone"" with a book I've actually read at over 700 words per minute. 

It's how I've always read, not rushing or anything. This seems to relate to ability to visualize the content in novels, as I've always read technical and programming books more slowly.

Lately, I've been frustrated because it seemed like it was taking a long time to finish books. I checked, and my reading speed seems to have dropped a good deal. It's not around 275 to 350 words per minute. I don't know why.

I'm not experiencing any sort of cognitive decline that I can tell and I've still been reading a lot of books, but it's kind of driving me up the wall because for probably the first time ever I'm growing a backlog of books to read faster than I can read them. Books I used to read in a day or two can now take 4 days. Longer books that might have taken days can take a week or more. Heck, with less free time lately I've been reading 1Q84 off and on since August 2nd and I'm only 65% through it.

I feel weird about this, as it feels like I've lost something. Real life impact is probably minimal but it still feels that way.  And I hope it's temporary, maybe due to stress due to everything going on this year. But I don't know.

However, I finally got to read Brave New World last week. And man, it is actually the true order of the world. This post is not argue which book is better. It's just an appreciation of Huxley's world-building. As per me, we're being controlled yes, but without 1984's upfront and ruthless hate.

I'll let this quote by Neil Postman sum it up:

""What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.

In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.""",1984 made some accurate predictions but we're actually living in the Brave New World,1597847676
