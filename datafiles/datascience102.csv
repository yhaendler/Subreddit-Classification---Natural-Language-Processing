datascience,"Some context, I'm gonna be speaker for a meetup and I want to touch the fundamentals for people who wants to start their career as data scientists.

Rather than talk about the usual stuff (develop math, biz and coding skills) **I want to people reflect on the mindset they need to build to develop so they can become successful data scientist**.

Right now I have for things to share with them:

1. _Curiosity_: Data scientist are people with lot of curiosity and they are willing to research. If your stay curious you will have the mindset for ask questions, look for data, formulate hypothesis and test them

2. _Perseverance_: Usually, Data Science is a rough path. There is no magic bootcamp or 6 month course to become a good scientific. You need to stay focus and practice your skills pretty often (even by just listening a podcast or reading a paper).

3. _Emphaty_: You have put yourself in other scenarios rather than just thinking inside the Data Science side. Often you need to collaborate with other disciplines and understand the context of unknown situations. You might analyze social events, business metrics, human behavior, etcetera.

4. _Participation_: As data scientists, we need to get our hands dirty. No better way to learn (imo) than build real applications, solve real problems.

datascience,"The situation is like this:  We receive deliveries of data electronically, and let's say they are expected to arrive at 8 AM daily. But historically they can arrive at say 5-10 AM. So it's periodic but not really. The data is gathered only hourly at the top of the hour. 

The data we're gathering now is basically ""time since last arrival""  which is zero when something has arrived in the last hour, and ticks up hour by hour until the next delivery.  What I've been doing so far is fitting this with a sawtooth wave and whenever a delivery is late, the ""time since last"" goes above the threshold and alerts us.  I researched time series data and such but it's not really what I'm looking for. 

Here's the issue:  we have dozens of different ones of these per customer and hundreds of customers,  and my fitting works well most of the time, but there are still a large number of false alerts. Also, some of these are 7 days a week, others are M-F,  others are more than once per day.  All very different kinds of sawtooths, and a lot of manual adjusting. 

What I've started doing is just collecting a histogram of when the arrival delay is zero vs hour of the day, this gives me just a set of times. I did this for one example of a reasonably well behaved data set and got a distribution that was rather skewed but fittable. I have enough history to look back 6 weeks. This gives only 6 data points for e.g. a Tuesday, but for 7-day-per-week systems there is no problem aggregating all the days and looking just at the hour of the day (42 total data points)  But knowing when to combine 7 days, vs 5/2 split etc is a manual decision. I would prefer it it could fit each arrival event separately.

(I'm actually looking at the data for 6 weeks plotted over 1 week timeframe of 168 hours per week, so I see the scatter plots overlayed and can guess at the amount of variation when I do these, so for example 8 AM Tuesday would be at T=56 hour and constructing the threshold sawtooth function on that axis.)

What I am looking for (perhaps) is a way to give say, based on the real history, give me the time of day that if the packet hasn't arrived by, there's a high % chance that it's late and set an alarm. 

Since the history can and does contain some that were late (or absent) I know those should factor in with less weight. I don't know what kind of distribution these should fit or how to output a cutoff value for a given % chance it's out of compliance.  And the reason I'm trying is so I can script this to analyze hundreds of such data sets and set thresholds automatically. 

Any suggestions where to look?    Online article?  videos?  
I would be interested in suggestions for textbooks as well.

Sadly I think it was an air raid for the most part... and I don't think I did very well.

I didn't really get many rapid fire trivia questions, although I got some, and I had to answer a couple with ""I don't know."" For example I was asked what is the mathematical equation to calculate p-values... I answered with ""I don't remember? I would have to consult my college notes from 11 years ago"". In my head I was thinking, why does it matter when scikit learn or R does that all under the hood? There was another trivia question I got which I answered I don't know but will not say what it was for the sake of not outing myself incase the interviewers are reading this.

I got some data engineering questions(not my strong suit) and I don't believe I gave good answers. Everywhere I have been I have worked along side with data engineering teams but have never actually done the data engineering work. When I got to the point of the interview where I could ask questions I asked if this role was more of a data science role or data engineering role and they said definitely data science, they have separate data engineering teams, so I have no idea why I was even asked these questions.

I think my strong suit was using my past work experiences to outline how I got things done, but even then I am not sure if my responses were good enough because I felt like I was on defense from the get go. I do better in interviews when I am ""on offense"", so to speak. For example I was asked for an example of how I segmented customers in the past and used that to drive revenue growth. I said I would look at various segmentation techniques and choose the best one based on model performance against test data, and how I determined that to be K-Means clustering after using PCA to reduce the number of features and using a scree plot to determine the number of segments. And how this segmentation approach allowed us to grow our revenue from 4th place in the market to 2nd place. I don't think I was precise or deep enough in this answer and was too vague and I didn't project enough confidence. But, in an hour long verbal interview, how deep am I supposed to go? I struggled with finding the right balance of depth and respecting the time constraints.

I'll be surprised if I don't get rejected... but I feel like this format was tough to succeed in. I believe I am a strong data scientist, but I am at my best when I know exactly what scenario I am facing. Questions like ""Here is what we want to accomplish, how would you do it?"" are what I do best, I didn't get any of those questions. It was more open ended broad questions such as ""What is your go to machine learning model"" and I literally could have given anything. It depends on the task at hand. I said Random Forest to go with the question and how I like the built in OOB functionality in R. Although if I could answer the question again I'd go with Gradient Boosting. 

Another question I hated was ""How do you stay on top of data science industry trends"". I didn't really know how to answer that one. I said I stay engaged with publications and gave a personal example of what I do in my free time(that I won't say since I don't want to out myself incase those who interviewed lurk here) but I don't like this because I believe you stick with what works and you don't always need to be jumping to the new and shiny toy out there unless there is a good reason, and if there was you'd probably know about it without having to be proactive to learn about it.

Another question was ""Do you follow up on your own models performance against real world data?"". I didn't have a problem with this question because of course I do. Who doesn't? I said its one thing for a model to have high accuracy on train and test data, its another thing for it to actually perform on real world data that you collect after the training and testing process. Therefore you want to make sure its actually hitting the marks that you calibrated during the model building phase otherwise go back to the drawing board. Then they followed up with ""What if you gained more responsibilities on your plate and could no longer follow up on all of your models?"", which I think was a silly follow up, because I feel that is putting the cart before the horse. I said in a hypothetical scenario where my bandwidth was overextended to where I could not do such a thing, as I hope it would not get to that point, I would have to resort to being a leader and calibrating the bandwidth of my team and allocating resources to ensure it does get done.

I got asked ""How do you perform feature selection"" and I simply explained various ways to do it based on the model at hand(i.e. p-Values for linear regression, feature score for Random Forest, etc.). I didn't like this question because its something you would ask an entry level candidate, not someone interviewing for director. I answered it anyway but with only an hour, I feel like better questions could have been asked.

The interview was solely to gauge my technical abilities, not my leadership or management abilities, so I understand that the interview was aimed to do that. With that being said I don't think I answered the questions given to me with enough confidence or precision. I am good at gauging body language, facial expressions and tone of voice of those interviewing me and I don't think they were impressed. If its up to these 2 guys I don't have a chance. The only way I have a chance is if all I needed to do was show some basic technical competency and the hiring manager(who was on the call but was just there to listen) values my management/leadership attributes and track record more than my hour long call with these 2 guys. 

Comparing this interview to the 3 bad ones I had before I think this one was definitely the worst of the bunch in terms of how I gauged my performance. I am starting to lose confidence in my interviewing skills, as I believe I have a hard time translating my actual 10 year track record into verbal competency. I know how to do things, I just have a hard time coherently explaining how those things are done.

Fortunately... I have another interview starting in 10 minutes... and 5 others lined up this week. But this was the job I really wanted out of all of them.","UPDATE: Just had my interview, was it an ""air raid"" style of interview that I was afraid it was going to be?",1621882657

datascience,"Hey everyone!

Got the chance to speak with Li Yin, who's a Research at Facebook AI. Learn about her role, what she does, and in particular how there are different branches of research at Facebook AI.

The cool thing about working at Facebook AI as an applied researcher is that you not only have a big impact on the research community through the work you do, but you’re also able to have a big impact on Facebook’s product direction and the millions of users on the platform.

Hope you enjoy the interview.

\-------

## Can you tell me a bit about what you work on at Facebook?

I work at Facebook AI, particularly applied research, as a Research Scientist, developing computer vision models for AR use cases. Our models eventually go from research to production.

A lot of our work also revolves around data - so it’s not just modelling. For example, in computer vision, we need to figure out what data we train our models with, what is important for the user, and how to annotate this data (for ex: what’s the timeline). So a lot of this work usually involves collaboration with data scientists and data engineers.

Since our models eventually go into production, we also work closely with product managers to fine tune different use cases and implementation practices.

I’m based in Menlo Park, California, USA.

## What set of skills is your team seeking for and how can someone join your team?

There are many different roles that Facebook AI hires, such as these categories:

* Research Scientist and Software Engineer with ML and deep learning background.
* UXR, Product designer, product manager
* App developer as we have prototype team

We either directly hire people into our teams, mostly Research Scientists or we hire from boot camps where people are hired into facebook but not positioned at a particular team. At facebook, most are hired without team selection.

Direct hires into teams are likely high stake engineers or researchers with particular research backgrounds that the teams are early looking for. So in this case, the recruiter would reach out to published researchers in the field in which Facebook is looking to hire.

## Is your team focused on theoretical research, applied research or both? Can you give us some examples of what type of work you are doing and who you collaborate with?

Compared with FAIR labs who work on pure research goals with a \~5 years vision, our project is often &lt; 2 years long, and each project is started with particular use cases in mind such as product surfaces where our models will be launched on, deployed in cloud or on-device. Our work consists of both research and MLOps and our time is split into 3 chunks (1) data collection and data annotation, (2) modeling, and (3) work cross-functionally with product teams to scope proper use cases.

Research that is conducted under FAIR labs will often not even have a use case. But for us, we know that there is a real-world use case that our research needs to satisfy. So for example, within computer vision, our image detection model might have the specific use case of trying to identify fraudulent ads in mind.

It’s cool to get to work both on the research side and the production side. The beginning of a project is obviously more research heavy, and then towards the end we collaborate more and more with other stakeholders.

The contrast between both types of tasks can be challenging at times. This is because when you do research, it’s a different mind state to when you have to actually identify and map out use cases that real world users will be impacted by. The latter is more of a product engineering or product management type task.

So you get to talk to all kinds of different people, like some who are actually creating apps that users interact with, others like UI designers who are crafting the user experience, etc. I find all of this really enjoyable.

## Tell me a bit more about some of these projects you’re working on.

One of my projects is related to object detection based on different user personas. This is a novel and challenging research project that doesn’t have too much current literature in the academic space, so it’s exciting.

This is a project that we’ve already secured 2 or 3 different use cases for and we are currently in the research phase.

## Do you enjoy the research part more or the product use case part more of a project?

Each project has different time periods. During research mode, as I mentioned earlier, you don’t really want to do too much cross-functional collaboration because you’re heads down reading academic papers and doing a lot of computational heavy work.

But during the planning stage, so even before the research has begun, there’s a lot of room for discussion with other colleagues and you’re able to bounce ideas off each other. This process can be really fun too.

Finally, it’s important to remember that the research we do is very useful for real-world users, so there’s an opportunity for big impact. There’s also an opportunity to shape the product direction of the company.

## How is work life balance like at Facebook?

I will say that remote work due to the pandemic has often blurred the line between work and free-time because there’s often no end to research (there’s always something you can do!). And all of us enjoy our work, so it’s very easy to fall into the trap of overworking and burning out.

I think that as an intern, in general, you skew more towards the work side of things because you’re trying to prove yourself and get a return offer. So interns at companies like Facebook and Nvidia often do a lot of overtime.

But overall, it’s important to remember that different people have different working styles. Some people derive a lot of meaning from their work, so they often don’t see the long hours they spend working as a “bad thing”. This is especially the case with smart researchers you work with at Facebook AI - these are individuals that are at the top of their fields and love to learn.

Our managers do often ask us whether we’re ensuring that we have a good work life balance in place, but we never know how to answer that question because we’re so engaged with our work!

## What is your favorite thing about working as a Research Scientist at Facebook?

My favorite thing has to do with the impact that I can have. Both the impact for the research community and the impact on the product side are huge - they’re equally exciting. I also don’t want to just join a pure research team because I’ve come to enjoy the production side of our projects as well.

Something that’s pleasantly surprised me about working at Facebook has been how open the culture is. Your managers are really invested in your personal growth and want to make sure you find your work meaningful. It’s also really common to discuss career paths with your managers so that you’re always headed in the direction you want.

Personally, I’ve really enjoyed growing in so many ways outside of research (which was what my background mainly consisted of). You have to work with different people, manage conflict, improve your communication skills, and be a team player. These all areas I’ve grown in tremendously.

Mainly I would like to get into MLOps or DS but I am afraid that with my current skillset it would be hard to have the time to build a project that would be significant enough to put in my CV.

In addition, I'm having a 3 months internship this summer as a software developer since I was refused to all the intern positions as DS/ML. However, I might have to deal with some ML stuff during that period.

datascience,"Ok, context in a nutshell, been at this tech company for about 4yrs in a mixture of roles from product to market research, but been working as a data analyst for the last 2yrs, nearly 2.5

My goal had been (and agreed with HR) to progress towards a data scientist role when I originally signed up to it. But this has not materialised.

Fast forward 2.5yrs, the data science guys that were brought in have been let go and there are zero plans for a team to be setup again. I've had absolutely nobody in the business to learn from, everything has been self-taught and because I was never fully in the data science team to start with, my day to day work has been much more BI related (dashboards, product stats etc) as opposed to core data science tasks. I really have to go out of my way if I want to write and code, even SQL (this place is so protective over their systems I'm often unable to get data myself and need to request access, then it's just an out the box plug in to PowerBI/Tableau or similar

I've absolutely maxed out my patience with this company and their talk the talk grand plans. My technical skills have totally stagnated, and if I was to compare it to when I left uni, my skills regressed in areas such as advanced mathematical/statistical techniques. My day to day tasks typically involve adhoc requests solved with Tableau (with absolutely horrendous data quality). There are some back end things involving SQL/Mongo/AWS but these are probably 10% overall if even that.

The only thing it has the appeals is a degree of autonomy with what I do once I finish the adhoc requests. I easily have 50% of my working hours to address anything I like (in my more motivated, enthusiastic days this was spent addressing the data quality issues, data warehouse etc, but the way these ideas and suggestions were valued/met killed my soul; options and recommendations closed due to 'time', 'cost', 'effort' etc

I'm thinking of just self teaching the core data science content I wanted to initially learn (I'm already doing this, just not applying it to anything at work), and finding things to apply this to at work. 

The problem is, I'm all alone. Nobody in this company has a data science background, so I can't learn from anyone here. I'll have no idea if what I am doing is good practice or even straight up wrong. Even if I did, the data is such bad quality and held in rigid, closed off systems (I am always refused direct access to it) that I'm not convinced there's a lot of real insight to get from it

Given that I have no real world data science experience, I'll be competing for entry roles in a competitive job market. So I'm really not sure if I should stick at this place and do my own thing on the job (flying blind, probably with low output) or just quit, spend summer selfteaching and practicing on projects I actually care about personally, while applying for jobs (have some master's degree offers in September if shit hits fan)","Completely and totally 'burnt out' at work, unsure if I should quit or just go rouge and do my own core data science based projects?",1621865638

We're just starting off in developing a data strategy at our (rather small) company, but in the meanwhile we want to start collecting data and set up the processes for automatic data collection in almost all parts of the business, so we can have a reference point in starting off with the strategy.

There are, of course, data sources that already have structured data that can be queried, mostly related to marketing like Google Analytics, Search Console, Facebook Marketing and the like. Then there are those data sources that we have to quantify in some way, related to clients, finances, management/hr and the like that although seem to fit more in the structured data category than unstructured, they don't already have an inherent and evident structure to them. So we have to collect and store these data in some way that is as usable and resource efficient as possible before we decide on a specific data architecture.

So, I guess my question would be, generally how do you approach storing different kinds of data in a way that's resource efficient and also easily queryable. I was thinking of doing something like GA does with scopes, dimensions and metrics, and trying to fit everything in this paradigm for now.

What do you think? What are your rules of thumb for starting off with collecting data like this?

**Context**. I'm part of a nonprofit project to build an app that's aimed to help people living nearby find friends-by-interests and kickoff offline communication. We're in a very early stage so unfortunately I don't have any links/texts/images to share with you except the description below.

Here's what we want to achieve:

* Users can add as many \*interest tags\* as they want where interest tag is defined as a short English phrase like ""computer science"", ""psychology"", ""Harry Potter"", ""chatbots"", ""crypto"", ""LoL"", ""Mayakovsky"" etc.
* The system can calculate \*similarity\* between two users and explain why the users are considered as similar.

The simplest approach would probably be to just provide a hardcoded list of topics. Then we can just count the number of common tags for two users (applying some normalization since users can provide drastically different numbers of tags), then apply some thresholding and if the similarity is higher than a threshold we can provide common tags as the explanation for similarity.

But this approach has a big drawback: users are forced into tight limits of a small predefined set of tags. So we decided to try another approach: apply some pre-trained word embeddings to convert tags into vectors, then aggregate all the tags into a vector representation of a user and apply cosine similarity. The question is: what's a good procedure for such aggregation?

We chose fasttext as a tool to get vector representations. And it has a convenient \`get\_sentence\_vector\` method to get vectors for individual tags even when they are phrases rather than words (""computer scince"", ""web development"", ""classic music"" etc.) but I'm not sure how to proceed then. Should we just normalize and average the resulting vectors or there are some better approaches that I didn't manage to find on Google? Maybe there is a different vectorization tool that can better handle our task?

datascience,"Hello everyone,

last year i finished my bachelor in economics and social science. Since then it has been constant struggle for me to find out what i want to do in life.

My original plan was to do a master in economic policy consulting (there is a master program an my uni) but in the end I stepped away from this idea, cause I dont think it fits me well and maybe doesnt increase my chances of finding a job,

After checking my options and realising, that i want to have a big quantitative part in my job, I´m left with two options: Doing a second bachelor in data science (DS) or starting a master program in Econometrics (ECON). They offer a master in DS too, but I´m missing some points in CS, to get accepted.

During my bachelor a I had three lectures in statistics, which i all passed with 1,x (I´m from europe btw). I didnt take a course in econometrics then, cause I didnt think I´ll ever need it. Last few months I started to teach myself with Data Camp some R, Python and SQL.

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of tend to go with the master in ECON, cause

1) Its one year shorter

2) It builds up on my economics knowledge, where in DS-bachelor I´d probaly not use it that much

3) I can specialize in some intresting fields, f.e. risk management.  I try to get an intership in risk management right now, but I guess I wont get an offer.

4) I read somewhere, that its possible to switch over from ECON to DS in your career, cause the skills you learn in ECON are pretty transfarable. So even if I dont do the bachelor, I\`d still be able to beome somewhat of a data scientist/analyst.

Also, even after detecting an anomaly through time series models, we don't have any mechanism to evaluate them
2. While building a time series model, should we include the underlying variables as the predictors? Or just treat the target variable as a univariate variable and perform Root cause analysis on the detected anomaly events?

This post, soon to be Blog, feels like a much needed post here. Since so many people are looking to either start their career in data science or do their career shift. I will explain how I did it, and how many have done it before me and how many will do after.

*This isn't a post on getting accepted at a FAANG or NASA...* 

**Essentials**

* know a bit of coding (Python or R preferably). I said a bit, because you can develop your skills along the way
   * list comprehension, loops, writing small concise functions, regex (i suck at that tbh)...
   * Pandas (very important for data manipulation) (or its equivalent in R )
   * Numpy (or its equivalent in R )
   * matplotlib for visualization (or its equivalent in R)

Everyone uses stackoverflow and google to find a few answers here and there so don't feel scared.

* Statistics 
   * No need to be a god in Stat, stick to the basics that we learn at school. the more advanced concepts are either too much for a regular job or for the seniors (which means you will have time to learn them while at your company)
   * Your bestfriend is [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer)
* Well written CV. One concise page about yourself. Highlight yourself without giving too much details so you can have something to talk about in your interviews.
   * if you get nervous during interviews, try applying for random positions (that you don't really care about) to receive interviews to improve your skills and confidence when talking to HRs (I have done that, it helped a lot) (*not too ethical but it helps*)

**Bonus**

* A **certificate** (or equivalent), I truly like DataCamp (reason why below and [here](https://dataanalystlife.blogspot.com/2021/05/is-datacamp-worth-it.html)), even though I got rejected when I applied for a position at their firm. Some of their professors teach at top notch universities (in Europe and USA ...)
* **Dashboarding** tools (PowerBI/Tableau ...).
* Master's degree. Not for the sake of what you learn, but for the **title**.
* A very well developed **GitHub** with plenty of projects (if you have this already, you wouldn't need to read the post for sure)
* Internships! If you're still studying at uni. Try to secure as much internships as possible you will create an attractive and robust CV.

**My Background (skip if you don't care)**

I am a Civil Engineer and a master of AI student at a top university in Belgium. I still have my thesis to defend, if I fail, I am dropping out. I have aced (in my opinion) all my other theoretical courses.

I have taken Machine Learning courses, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and others (only mentioning the trendy ones). In parallel to that, I was doing a certificate on DataCamp called ""Data Scientist Track With Python"" and I truly [believe](https://dataanalystlife.blogspot.com/2021/05/is-datacamp-worth-it.html) that this track was a game changer to me (my blog has a bit of details about that).

**My first Internship at KPMG-BE**

I was one of two interns at KPMG-BE in summer 2020. We got both accepted within the AI team. My topic was about bias and fairness in AI (in other words racism against minorities, sexist models...). I had to make a case study on why reducing the bias of datasets is needed to improve the society and abide to legislations (its a long story).

I used the skills acquired by DataCamp to play with datasets, create visualizations, train models... 

The other soft skills needed were good communication skills and PowerPoint (**communication IS HIGHLY important**).

**My second Internship at PwC-BE**

On this internship I learned the most valuable lessons of my life. By my two mentors, P. and A. (if they ever read that, they will know themselves). *BTW I was working as a Data Analyst/consultant*.

1. Having common sense and business acumen is a must in many DA/DS jobs
2. Understanding that seniors don't care about your incredible skills if you can't communicate them.
3. No-code software like **Alteryx** are GODLY (in my opinion), especially if you're not a programmer. Now, if you are a programmer Alteryx will help you develop a very good intuition for data cleaning and manipulation.
4. Prototyping/agile work is very useful for your clients
5. Knowing how to use a dashboarding tool is crazy good to communicate your ideas

**My third Internship/Project with a company**

On this internship, I was part of a team of 6, where we had to do a market study on everything related to green energies and their infrastructure. Not related to data science but it helps in developing your skills.

For each day, the global daily number is known by aggregating each country number. And each country cases can be further grouped into different variables like by virus variant, by country state, etc.

If someone looks at the global time series, it’s hard to know which variables are contributing to the number of cases without cutting and slicing the data.

Are there methods that allow us to surface the variable values that contribute to the number or cases for a given time interval?

This sounds somewhat easy, like I can calculate the contribution percentage of each variable value, and sort them.

Though I may also be interested in the contributing trend as well which can be positively contributing to the global number of cases and negatively contributing to the global number of cases.

From my cursory reading, I found topics such as aberration detection. Or generally anomaly detection. But these topics almost never explain what are the variable values that contribute to the anomaly. It max explain anomalous points due to trends and seasonalities but not so much on what are the explanatory variables given that we have aggregated time series.",What are methods that explain aggregated time series anomalies?

Before you start thinking it’s another of those “I have no experience but want to become a data scientist by end of year” post - rest assured it’s not. 

I have an office job that I’m happy with, my role does not require any data analytics / data science / programming.
I do work on daily basis with Google sheets and some basic sequel - but it’s very basic and my role does NOT require me to be any better at it.

Last summer with pandemic, working from home etc I thought I would like to learn something new, something challenging I could be proud of and never thought was possible. In August I started learning Python and MySQL. I enjoy Python and spend approx 1h/day learning but boy it does kick my ass. Even though I’m still far from being capable of doing any real coding, I’m truly happy I know the basics and I can even read others code to some extent and understand it. Looking forward to learning more of that.

On top of that I’m reading introductory book about data structures and algorithms, so I have overall broader understanding.

Recently I thought it would be a good idea to learn some basics of data analysis / science / stats - not so I can become a data scientist, but just so I’m just smarter as a person. I think it would be good to know some fundamentals.
Maybe it will prove useful at work one day - maybe not. Maybe it will help me with getting better at spreadsheets and SQL (I have ability, if I wanted to, to work much more with Gsheets and SQL at my company, but I feel a bit too intimidated).
Maybe it will always be just for my personal growth- either way, I’m happy.

Greykite’s main algorithm is Silverkite, which delivers automated forecasting, which LinkedIn uses for resource planning, performance management, optimization, and ecosystem insight.

While using predictive models to estimate consumer behavior, data drift has proven to be a great challenge during the pandemic in 2020. In such a situation, predicting future expectations is challenging as well as necessarily helpful to any business. Automation, which allows for repeatability, can increase accuracy and can be used by algorithms to make decisions further down the line. According to LinkedIn, Silverkite has improved revenue forecasts for ‘1-day ahead’ and ‘7-day ahead’ and Weekly Active User forecasts for 2-week ahead.

datascience,"ResNet-18 global, unstrctured, magnitude based and iterative pruning with CIFAR-10 dataset. The pruning goes on till 99.08% sparsity.

This is based on the research papers:

1. ""Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient Neural Networks"" by Song Han et al.
2. ""Deep Compression: by Song Han et al.
3. ""The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis"" by Frankle et al.
4. ""What is the State of Neural Network Pruning?"" by Blalock et al.

Original and unpruned model has  val\_accuracy = 88.990% . Original model size = 42.7 MB, zipped model size = 40 MB.

Pruned model with sparsity = 99.063% has  val\_accuracy = 91.260%. Pruned, trained and zipped model size = 3.5 MB. This results into a compression ratio = 11.43%.

You can refer to the code [here](https://github.com/arjun-majumdar/Neural_Network_Pruning/blob/main/ResNet18_Global_Magnitude_Custom_Pruning.ipynb).

*NOTE:* Post pruning PyTorch doesn't cast tensors to sparse format. Therefore, the tensors are of the same dimensions as before but with 0s in it to denote pruned connections.

I was just reading the article below which suggests that a t-test or z-test could be used since the distribution of the sample statistic should converge towards a normal distribution due to the CLT. The only divergence would be that the variance of the sample would need to be estimated. https://blog.analytics-toolkit.com/2017/statistical-significance-non-binomial-metrics-revenue-time-site-pages-session-aov-rpu/

I can't imagine how many times you must've heard this question, but I'm not sure where to ask. I'm creating a Linux-only Python3 script to apply and manage text tags for files and directories. It am using sqlite3 rdbms. Output will look like this:

    [mike@homelab tag]$ python3 ls.py -latr
    
    -rw-rw-r--  2 mike mike    20 May 21 21:39 newfile1		tag2
    -rw-rw-r--  2 mike mike    20 May 21 21:39 file1ln		tag1 tag2
    -rw-rw-r--  1 mike mike    20 May 21 21:40 flie1cpmv	tag1
    drwxrwxr-x  2 mike mike    39 May 21 22:32 tmp			tag1 tag2 ta... (5)

and (more lazily) 

    [mike@homelab tag]$ python3 findtags tag1
    flie1cpmv	
    file1ln		
    tmp
    ../../outer-space/but/still/same/ext4filesystem/file.jpg

Now, I have a sysadmin background, so I'm familiar with some concepts, and do some very simple queries at work. But, now I'm in the (rather interesting!) position of deciding how to structure the data in the tables and need someone to tell me what to do/learn. I want it to keep a record of

- which tags are applied to a given file

- which files have a given tag

To identify unique files, I'm trying out using the combination of absolute filepath + inode number (together, as text). Tags are text and are unique. I'm hoping to keep total number of files under about 5,000, but in reality it will probably be less than 500.

I got stuck after deciding to make two tables, `by-filename` and `by-tagname`. by-filename will look something like:

               filepath_inode      |      tags (space delimited)
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     /home/zeebrow/f1.txt12346789  | ""firstfile deleteme source_controlled""
     /home/zeebrow/f2.txt25543     | ""deleteme source_controlled""
     /home/zeebrow/f3.txt1237895   | ""source_controlled""

and by-tagname:

           tag         |  filepath_inodes (space delimited)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    firstfile          | ""/home/zeebrow/f1.txt12346789""
    deleteme           | ""/home/zeebrow/f1.txt12346789 /home/zeebrow/f2.txt25543""
    source_controlled  | ""/home/zeebrow/f1.txt12346789 /home/zeebrow/f2.txt25543 /home/zeebrow/f3.txt1237895""

I wanted to easily ask `""SELECT tags FROM by-filename WHERE filepath_inode=? ""` and `SELECT filepath_inodes FROM by-tagname WHERE tag=?`but 5k text values in a single database field feels dirty somehow. Plus Python is not going to like parsing that.  I was thinking about adding columns when new tags/files are found, which might be easier in my head.
