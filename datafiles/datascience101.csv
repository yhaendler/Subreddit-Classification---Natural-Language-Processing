I have taken this year off as I was offered a six-month internship at a FANG company as a Business Intelligence/Data Analyst.

My story goes something like this:

I graduated an MBA and started life in Finance but eventually I moved into a startup and my role was to make P&amp;L projections and B-plans to raise funding. Doing this made me an Excel Pro. I was the goto guy in small org whenever someone would get stuck anywhere in Excel. 

Later I moved into another startup where I found that I can use tools like Power BI and Tableau to improve data visibility to more people in the org. Slowly I started getting better at Tableau and also SQL to get data into Tableau.

Soon, I ran into a problem. It was clear that there were too many errors in the data as the organization grew. The growth was just too fast and the volume of data exploded. Soon I found myself learning Python and pandas to process this data, put it into a data warehouse and then create leaner sql tables which can then be used by the Tableau designers (Yeah, by now I had got disassociated from Tableau). 

In few years, I am the guy who has to ensure the quality of data and automate this process as much as possible. I was writing nifty little scripts to fetch data for quick queries and reports.

Now, I've reached a place where I have been told to leave the organization as I don't seem to be bringing value to the organization. My boss remarked that instead of taking a leadership role I had gone too deep into the data. I understand where he is coming from, at one point the requirement for the organization to get the data accurate and comprehensive and I fulfilled that requirement but I failed to leverage it to become a ""Data Scientist"". Before I could do that, the small startup I had joined had become a really large org which bought in senior MBAs (most of them from the same alma matter as the founder) in leadership roles and I had no place left for me.

So now I find myself looking for a job and I am confused. I can't apply for proper Data Science role cause I was never one even though a lot of my skillset seem to be in sync with it. When I look for an analyst job, I am offered junior roles.

datascience,"&gt;TL;DR: Neural Search is a new approach to retrieving information using neural networks. Traditional techniques to search typically meant writing rules to “understand” the data being searched and return the best results. But with neural search, developers don’t need to wrack their brains for these rules; The system learns the rules by itself and gets better as it goes along. Even developers who don’t know machine learning can quickly build a search engine using open-source frameworks such as [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina).

## What is Neural Search?

There is a massive amount of data on the web; how can we effectively search through it for relevant information? And it’s not just the web where we need it: Our computers store terabytes of company and personal data that we need to work with; we need effective search to get our day-to-day job done. And what do I mean by effective search

* Can we go beyond just matching keywords?
* Can we search using natural language, just like we would write or speak?
* Can we make the search smart enough to forgive our minor mistakes?
* Can we search for things that aren’t an exact match but are “close enough”?

We can answer all those questions with one word: Yes. To understand how, we need to enter the world of Natural Language Processing. NLP is a field of computer science that deals with analyzing natural language data, like the conversations people have every day. NLP is the foundation of intelligent search, and we have seen three different approaches in this field as follows.

## Evolution of search methods

1. **Rules (1950–1990s)**Complex handwritten rules that emulate Natural Language Understanding.**Drawbacks:** Handwritten rules can only be made more accurate by increasing their complexity, which is a much more difficult task that becomes unmanageable over time.
2. **Statistics (1990s — 2010s)**Probabilistic decisions based on weights, machine learning and feature engineering.Creating and managing rules was solved with machine learning, where the system automatically learns rules by analysing large real-world texts.**Drawbacks:** These statistical methods require elaborate feature engineering.
3. **Neural Networks (Present)**Advanced machine learning methods such as deep neural networks and representation learning.Since 2015, statistical methods have been largely abandoned, and there has been a shift to [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) in machine learning. Popular techniques using this method make it a more accurate and a scalable alternative. It involves

* Use of \`word embeddings\` to capture semantic properties of words
* Focus on end-to-end learning of higher-level tasks (e.g., question answering)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When you use Neural Networks to make your search smarter, we call this a **Neural Search System**. And as you will see, it addresses some of the critical shortcomings of other methods.

Note that the applications of Neural Search are not just limited to text. It goes well beyond what NLP covers. With neural search, we get additional capabilities to search images, audio, video, etc. Let’s look at a comparison of the extreme ends of search methods — “Rules” vs “Neural Networks”:

## Rules (Symbolic Search) vs Neural Networks (Neural Search)

While the Neural Search method has become more widespread since 2015, and should be the primary focus area of any new search system. However, we shouldn’t completely rule out Symbolic (rule-based) Search methods. In fact, using a combination of Neural Search and Symbolic Search may result in optimized results. Let’s look at some of the powerful applications of Neural Search

## Applications Of Neural Search

**Semantic search**

🔍 addidsa trosers (misspelled brand and category, still returns relevant results similar to query “adidas trousers”)

**Search between data types**

With Neural Search, you can use one kind of data to search another kind of data, for example using text to search for images, or audio to search for video.

**Search with multiple data types**

With Neural Search, you can build queries with multiple query data types e.g. search images with text+image

## Get started with Neural Search

For rule-based searches, **Apache Solr, Elasticsearch, and Lucene** are the de-facto solutions. On the other hand, Neural Search is relatively new domain, there aren’t so many off-the-shelf packages. Also training the neural network for such a system requires a lot of data. These challenges can be solved using [Jina](http://github.com/jina-ai/jina/), an open-source neural search framework.

I’m doing undergrad research now and being challenged  by my professor to go farther than just statistical learning methods, which is kind of my bread and butter, and look into network analysis.

Doing a quick Google search I’ve realized network analysis is widely applicable and graph theory is needed heavily when modeling relationships. 

As a statistics student, should I be focusing on graph theory fundamentals too? My major only offers math courses in linear algebra, real analysis, and multi variable calculus, but no graph theory. Everything else is ur typical stats courses: Bayesian, time series, regression, inference, ISLR etc",Importance of graph theory in data science?,1621360711

Let me start out by saying I am a “IT Support analyst intern” at my job, part time. What I do however is not all that complex, I use pivot tables and excel as forms to show company spending at several locations(I don’t recommend anything I simply show the bills in the best way I can, currently it’s a pivot table from the previous employee) 

My career goal is Data Science and starting out as a Data Analyst to get there. Perhaps getting a masters while being a Data Analyst. Currently, my higher ups told me if I can learn Python and how to somehow implement it in my job I can use it for resume building purposes, so I’m reading “Automate the Boring Stuff” since it has parts about Python with excel and PDFs.

Allow me to also note I am a CS major specializing in Data Science. This does have a class for Python with data science but I’d rather learn it sooner for experience purposes. This has nice a machine learning class too I won’t be able to take for another year. Of course SQL is in the database class next semester . 

My question is, what else should I be doing now to help get an actual data science internship sooner? Or data analyst if not, since that’s not my current job title. Would using Python with excel to show bill amounts count as a “Data analytic” experience? I would think not because it really doesn’t cover the broad strokes of the full job position “Data Scientist/Analyst” unless there’s a way I can visualize excel data I’m missing, apart from python. Is there any key skills I have to learn ASAP, even with a class coming up? Like SQL? And during this, what actual Data Science skills should I be looking at right now to aid in actually getting a possible data science internship?

While he’s been busy preparing for his AP tests and final exams, I’ve been researching what other students have done to get great internships during their undergraduate years.

My son actually landed his very first internship this summer doing data science stuff (he’s not sure exactly what since he doesn’t start for another few weeks, but he will be working remotely with a data scientist on the east coast) for a local doctor who is researching the safety and efficacy of certain COVID drug therapies through clinical trials. We don’t have many connections outside of the medical field and he is painfully shy, so I worry about his ability to network successfully. He’s also enrolled in a CS-specific summer program that will hopefully help expose him to some of the professors, advisors, resources, and upperclassmen at his school. He’ll continue to take a couple of college courses this summer at our local community college, but he’s never had a “real” job (just volunteer work). He has completed three CS/DS/programming classes thus far (one focused on JS, two on Python, and one touched on R) and six math classes including AP Calculus AB and college statistics. He’s hoping to have enough college and AP credits to qualify as a second-year for class registration purposes, and maybe double major and/or enroll in the accelerated master’s program (BS + MS in less than 5 years).
