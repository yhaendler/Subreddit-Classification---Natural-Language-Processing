books,"I’ve been growing suspicious of my Little Free Library being used by others in the neighborhood as a way to take books and sell to the local Half Price Books, and today I found a book that I donated to the LFL on the shelf at HPB. It was an old hardcover copy of a book on training puppies that I’ve had for 30 years, and obscure enough that I’m positive is the same one I donated.

It’s a shame to see people take advantage of what is a great idea, in order to get a little extra money for themselves. From now on I plan on donating directly to my local library.

books,"How does sight and blindness reveal meaning within Oedipus Rex?

Throughout the play there are numerous references to sight and blindness, obviously the ending and Oedipus blinding himself, but also with the character of Teiresias.  It’s a common motif in literature, the “blind seer,” ironic especially in Oedipus as the only characters who can really see the truth have no access to physical sight.  

Does sight and blindness represent something or give meaning to the work? Does it have a relation to Oedipus’s fate, perhaps a metaphor for his lack of free will, the futility of struggling against fate?",How does sight and blindness reveal meaning in Oedipus?,1615332405
books,"Hello there,

I would love to get some opinion, or rather, someone who knows what is going on with the book.

I would love to read the poem, but I am having trouble finding out which version is the right one, on the goodreads there are some Editions that span 1500+ pages, some editions that are separated into two parts each having 800+ pages and then there is the ""main"" one you can find as the primary on the goodreads and that is ""only"" 600+ pages long, so I have a hard time finding what size or edition would let me read the whole unabridged thing.

I haven't read as much criticism as I'd like to, but I wanna start. Till now I've read Susan Sontag, and I love her.

Another one is Geoffrey Hartman. I’ve read a bit of his Wordsworth commentary, and also found him really good. Erudite and well written.

books,"I understand this is going to sound weird, but I never grew up reading. I disliked reading so much (since I found it hard to concentrate) I didn’t even read my textbooks. I committed everything to memory using lectures from my teachers, and visuals haha. I had a really hard time imagining the words on the pages into visuals, and so I got bored. It was just “reading a bunch of words”. 

If there was some kind of art or I saw visuals beforehand then it made reading enjoyable. The few books I did read was because I had visuals to go off before hand. For example, one of my favorite books was Howl’s Moving Castle. Since as a child I could imagine the characters from the movie. I also ended up getting into visual novels because their was pictures to go along with it. 

I want to learn how to read more “properly” and enjoy it. I want to enjoy reading books that don’t have those “pre-existing” visuals. Learn to express myself better in words, and not have to re read everything over and over.

books,"Just wow. Feel very dumbfounded by the whole experience that is reading this memoir. I wanted to make a post right away, but I really needed to take some time to let the whole thing to soak in. 

The memoir follows the recollections of Guy Sajer, a German soldier on the Eastern Front during World War 2. It's gut wrenching. Its horrible and terrifying. The story doesn't look to take sides, but offer the perspective of one man and his comrades struggling for survival in war. 

At the end, I felt that it was just to much for men to endure. I can't comprehend what it means to fight for survival as men in such wars have and to live and reenter civilization. This is a must read. I will end with a quote from the book. 

“Too many people learn about war with no inconvenience to themselves. They read about Verdun or Stalingrad without comprehension, sitting in a comfortable armchair, with their feet beside the fire, preparing to go about their business the next day, as usual.  
One should really read such accounts under compulsion, in discomfort, considering oneself fortunate not to be describing the events in a letter home, writing from a hole in the mud. One should read about war in the worst circumstances, when everything is going badly, remembering that the torments of peace are trivial, and not worth any white hairs. Nothing is really serious in the tranquility of peace; only an idiot could be really disturbed by a question of salary.  
One should read about war standing up, late at night, when one is tired, as I am writing about it now, at dawn, while my asthma attack wears off. And even now, in my sleepless exhaustion, how gentle and easy peace seems!”",Finished the Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer,1615328939
books,"I finished ""The Years of Lyndon Johnson"" and I read ""The Power Broker"" last year. They were both incredible. Both of them are about people who were personally quite detestable, but became very powerful. It's more than a biography: Caro shows how the whole political system works and how people gain power in that system. Some of my favorite parts of his book are the mini-biographies of other people. Al Smith, Coke Stevenson. Or that Johnson brought big money into politics (He often outspent his opponents by 10x). Or how Moses ended up controlling the elected officials who were supposed to answer to him.

You were there with your mom, working your way through a picture book about how love is always stronger than anger. You were not afraid to ask for help when you couldn’t figure out a word, and weren’t ashamed when mom asked you if you wanted to take a short break and have her read the next few pages out loud. After finishing the one about the string, the next book you read from talked about a little boy who witnessed something terrible happen, who felt afraid and unsure, and had to seek help from the various adults in his life. I heard you ask your mom what the terrible thing was that happened to the little kid in the story, how it didn’t specify what was going on. Your mom whispered to you that she thought that that element was kept vague on purpose so that anybody reading this book could have an easier time relating to the feelings described. How even though they didn’t know what Sherman, the character in the book, experienced that caused him these bad dreams and anxieties might be similar to how the little girl was feeling now shortly after dad died. Mom pointed out that Sherman used art to try to make sense of these confusing emotions, and that maybe the little girl might find it helpful doing the same thing later that day at therapy. The mother whispered, “Remember last week when you were feeling really scared and upset when I dropped you off at school, and how you worried that I wouldn’t come back for you? Maybe you can try to show the doctor how this felt by drawing your feelings just like Sherman did. What do you think?” 

Your enthusiasm and eagerness shone through with every sentence you uttered. I saw you bring a sense of curiosity to your reading, asking your mom some deeply insightful questions and reading in between the lines. You even brought a sense of humor to your reading, creating little jokes about the characters and animatedly tweaking some of the phrasing as you read. I found this especially impressive considering how heavy the material at hand was. You approached the text thoughtfully and with grace and earnestness to learn something from it. Your mom chimed in many times throughout this experience to tell you how proud she was of you and how you were doing so, so well with your reading. Something about this display had me feeling profoundly moved. Not only was this a wholesome example of a child taking pride in learning a new skill, it was also an exceptional demonstration of parenting skills. Your mom was so patient and engaging with you, piping in with questions here and there to help you learn how to think critically. She was encouraging beyond measure, in a way that felt entirely genuine. She made sure to tell you why in particular she was proud of you instead of just doling out endless empty praise. She even choked up a bit there near the end, overcome with emotion just like I was two tables away, a random stranger who is adamantly childfree-by-choice. 

To this anonymous little girl, I cannot tell you how immensely proud I am of you. Your curiosity, earnestness, and tenacity will take you far in life. I’m beyond thrilled for you to be discovering the joys of reading for the first time as you find your footing in phonics so eagerly. You are opening yourself up to a world of joy and wonder, of endless capacity for entertainment, learning, and emotional immersion. No matter what you end up reading from here on out, I hope you feel empowered and fulfilled knowing that you are doing an amazing job. It sounds like you’re experiencing some extremely intense life changes, and I hope that reading is able to bring you solace through all these challenges. You are an inspiration, and so is your mom. I hope you are able to feel the fullness of the love she has for you, and know that you are not alone in your anxieties even when it may feel like you are. 

I couldn’t help myself, I had to chime in there as you and your mom were standing up to go, to tell you that I think you’re a really good reader and that I am really excited for you to be learning how to read. This display of overwhelming tenderness and wholesomeness made my day, and I thank you for that.

I enjoy these books but I have some major problems that maybe will be solved later on.

From The Name of the Wind already things were happening a little too... Conveniently. In this book it's way worse.

I feel like the author meant something to have happened way early in the first book but couldn't fit it in due to the age of Kvothe, but it would have partially covered all the blatantly convenient events later on. I'm referring to the ""oracle"" part. 

""I've been looking for this person many times I'll never find... Oh here he is"". And this happens so many times it's kind of annoying.

Also the second book feels like a huge tangent of a tangent of a tangent that has little to nothing to do with the main story. The author decided to just dump everything in a very short time, I kind of lost track of it.

I have not read the book so I cannot speak to its content, but do readers on this subreddit really encounter a life-changing book so often that the term should be used to discredit other works?

In my experience of reading, I have not encountered any life-changing book. No book has had that much impact that it has turned my life around, changed my entire mindset, or made me a new person. Has there been books that have influenced my values and opinions, absolutely yes, but that's a long stretch from being life-changing.

So when people expect The Alchemist to be a life-changing book, I always wonder at the character of those who says that. A truly life-changing book is something one might encounter once in your life. If every other book you read is life-changing for you you might want to look a bit inwards.

If I read The Alchemist sometime I will sure not approach it with expectations of having my life changed. Like any other book I will approach it with expectations of a good story and beautiful prose.","Is the term ""life-changing book"" really truthful?",1615312919

From the Iliad to The Lord of the Rings, which ones do you think fit the bill as the best that the 'genre' has to offer? (Even entries from film would work. I'm just looking for stories here.)

books,"After I read a book (and occasionally before), I love watching reading vlogs to see what how other readers' reactions and thoughts develop through the course of reading. While Goodreads reviews and blog posts are insightful, I find watching someone read a book you like really fascinating. For example, this is why I decided to read 11/22/63 by Stephen King.

Do you guys do something similar?",Reading vlogs for books?,1615303455

I feel like once things start happening it could get really interesting, but my lawd, i keep waiting and waiting and i feel like not one interesting thing has happened in 110 pages. Does it pick up or does it always move at this pace? Is the rest of it worth reading or should i move on? Please give me some feedback :) thanks",A Discovery of Witches: please help,1615303281
books,"I recently finished Shadow of the Sun and found it very compelling and interesting. But I’m curious to know if anyone from Africa is in this group and has read it, and what they might think of it. Particularly people from the places K. writes about going to. For those of you who don’t know the book, R. K. was a Polish journalist who spent decades in Africa reporting on various coups and civil wars across the whole continent. Shadow of the Sun is his autobiography about his experiences. Many thanks!",Rzyard Kapuscinski’s Shadow of the Sun. Have any Africans in this group read it?,1615303200
books,"I just finished reading a collection of Stefan Zweig's novellas based on a strong recommendation of A Chess Story. 

I enjoyed his work, I was waiting with baited breath for what would happen with Confusion. Everything was well written... but nothing particularly grabbed me. 

This isn't a criticism of Zweig - just previously I read One Hundred Years of Solitude and struggled with it. But after reading some of the history and reasons why other's loved it, it completely opened up the book and experience to me. 

So those of you that have loved Stefan Zweig's writing - what grabs you? What captures your imagination and makes him so beloved?",Why Do You Love Stefan Zweig?,1615303043
books,"i don't think I ever cried this much. what a wonderful piece of art! what kind of a human being has this ability to craft so much emotions and so much pain and trauma in the most relatable way possible!

willem and harold, i love you both! i literally live for this kind of love and support. 

jude is a tragic story of how much a person can take. the amount of trauma is just overwhelming and horrifying. there is no limit to how cruel the world can be. i dropped the book only when i felt triggered, i relate to him so much

beauty, pain, suffering, love, compassion, sacrifice and belonging. i felt every single kind of emotions through this ride

Can we stop downvoting opinions that don't match ours? This is just a way to drown out opinions and promote groupthink, which is of course bad for any community.

Just in the last few days, I have been incessantly downvoted and have seen other people also face the same, for nothing more than suggesting ideas that (in my opinion) shouldn't really be that controversial after all.
