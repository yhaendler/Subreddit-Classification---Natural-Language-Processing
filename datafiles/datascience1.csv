I know the pros and cons of different models and the general assumptions and math behind each, but I’m wondering if it would be worthwhile improving my understanding of the theory behind everything, as in a graduate level understanding. 

I’ve seen people who lack my understanding make bad assumptions that invalidate their results and am just wondering how deep into the theory I need to go in order to make sure I don’t do the same.

datascience,"Happy New Year's Eve Everyone,

I am a junior chemical engineering student in university with minors in math and computer science that is increasingly passionate about data science.  I am thinking a career as a data scientist would be very fulfilling; however, I am not sure what a great way to transition in this field would be.  I do have some experience to suggest that this career might be for me.  Let me offer some background.

I have been working for about a year in chemical industry.   My big project was using machine learning to predict a specific chemical reactor anomaly on time-series data.  In no particular order, this involved learning concepts such as:

&amp;#x200B;

* Visualizing the data or using multivariate metrics (i.e. Mahalanobis Distance)
* In general scrubbing and working with non-ideal datasets
* Exploring gradient boosting frameworks like XGBoost, grid-searching, evolutionary algorithms (TPOT), different types of neural networks
* Introducing new, calculated features in the dataset
* Using domain knowledge of the industry to maximize likelihood of success

I thoroughly enjoyed the work, whether it be exploring new concepts, meeting and setting expectations, deploying a model in production, etc.  Moreover, I enjoy a very results-driven work environment, which suggests industry is for me more than academia.  With this in mind, how should I transition?  Is a masters/phd appropriate to breakout into this field, or would it be more appropriate (or even possible) for me to try to breakout into industry right out of undergraduate?  If so, should I try to pursue an undergraduate internship specifically about data science?

If anyone could share their experience and advice, it would be greatly appreciated.",Seeking Advice to Transition Into Data Science (University Junior),1577808266

datascience,"Hi everyone, I am currently a business analyst at a large corporation and was considering moving in the direction of data. Throughout my career I have used a lot of SQL to pull data from our databases and VBA to automate reports. I had no formal education in programming though it has become a hobby of mine. I have learned on my own through the years through classes such as CS50 and Udemy courses to further my knowledge. I am no expert by any means but I understand programming concepts well and I have done small pet projects in my free time such as developing an android app.

The parts of my job that I enjoy the most are the SQL and VBA activities. I love putting together a VBA script that will automate something that would otherwise have taken a long time. I find the satisfaction of writing the script and seeing it work way more rewarding than anything else I have done in my career so far. It feels like I have built something that I know will be useful to someone else.

Recently I enrolled in Jose Portilla's udemy course on Data Science with Python. I am halfway through the course and feel that I am developing a very good understanding of the material. After enrolling in the course I began browsing this subreddit and it is rather discouraging. Recently I saw someone mention having a PHD and looking for an internship in data science. To me that screams enormous barrier of entry.. needing a PHD just for an internship? There is no way I can go back to school at the moment to get a PHD and I cannot afford too much of a pay cut as I am the sole provider for my family. It is disappointing because I was very much enjoying the content of Jose's class and was absorbing it rather naturally.

As of now I will continue the class to the end in the case that I learn something that I can use for a future analysis that no one else in my organization would know how to do. To them Python is magic.

Based on my post, does anyone have any advice for career pivots I can look into? As mentioned above I really enjoy writing scripts, automation, I enjoyed the Data Science that I was learning but the barrier of entry seems too high for where I am. I was thinking maybe I can continue learning Python and use it to become a BI Analyst or Test Automation engineer. I enjoy programming (though am not an expert) and writing scripts more than anything I have done in my career thus far. With that being said does anyone have any career advice?

datascience,"So don't get me wrong I hate SAS in general. I have a comp sci degree, have experience coding in many different languages, and get frustrated to no end every time I need to use SAS. I used to work at a job where I used R for 90% of my tasks and now work at a job where I use python for 90% of my tasks. But for all the shit it gets and the fact that it was coded in the 70s? It's still insanely fast and good at certain statistical tasks and medium-large sized data. I was working on a proof of concept to prove to my team python was much better and could replace SAS, and I was struggling. When dealing with small data python was much better, but who cares if you can do your work in 50ms compared to 200ms? When the data got bigger many of the tasks I was trying to replicate with python were so much slower that SAS was actually completing the task faster than python could even read the dataset into memory. I'm actually working on a project I can publish to a public github repo because I couldn't believe it. You would think python would shine with data that's slightly large but fits in memory, but SAS was actually winning this. When we started dealing with big data where python required dataset chunking SAS blew it out of the water performance-wise and obviously time to code-wise, since SAS required no modifications while python required much different code to handle chunks at a time.

  
Maybe there were some optimizations I could make with python to speed it up a bit, and I'm not saying SAS is not going to be obsolete in the next few years, I'm just saying I think a lot of data scientists hate on SAS without understanding the amount of genius that went into it. We're talking about software built in the 70s when large amounts of memory weren't a thing, and it still is out-performing state of the art data science programming software in 2019 for some use cases. I yearn for the day that's not the case and when real programming languages can replicate everything SAS can do, but the fact of the matter is the average r/datascience user scoffs at SAS while there are SAS users making way more money and performing data science tasks much faster and better than them. I much enjoy programming in R or python to SAS, but there are definitely things that SAS does much quicker than either language, which is amazing given the restrictions where it needs to store everything on the disk. Sure if you're an expert python coder you can probably optimize your work better than SAS, but if you're that skilled, you're probably a developer rather than a data scientist. SAS has incredibly fast operations given the flexibility it has and given the restraints of needing to work from the disk rather than memory, and if you're trying to maximize your value as a data scientist you're going to be focusing on things other than coding. If you're looking to be promoted as a data scientist today at a company that has SAS, R, and python, I think you're much more likely to be promoted by spending your time learning more AI/ML algorithms and implementing them in SAS than you are in spending that time optimizing an algorithm or process in R or python. Do you think your boss will be more impressed that you improved the model you own by lowering the adjusted R-squared and now your business can be more confident in its decision-making or will your boss be more impressed that you implemented the same model that's been running for a decade in an open-source programming language?

datascience,"Hi everyone, I have a very specific, weird question about applying MDS with Python.

When creating a distance matrix of the original high dimensional dataset (let’s call it distanceHD) you can either measure those distances with Euclidean or Manhattan distance.

Then, after performing MDS, let’s say I brought my 70+ columns down to 2 columns to plot it on a 2D graph. Now, I can create a NEW distance matrix. Let’s call it distance2D which measures those distances again, either in Manhattan or Euclidean.

Finally, I can find the difference between the two distance matrices (between distanceHD and distance2D) and this new difference matrix will show me if I preserved the distances in the MDS algorithm. I can then compute the stress using the stress function on that difference matrix and the closer the 0 that number is, the better the projection is.

My question: 
I was originally taught to use Manhattan distance in the distanceHD matrix, and to use the Euclidean distance in the distance2D matrix.  But WHY? Why not use Manhattan on both? Or Euclidean on both? Or Euclidean on distanceHD and Manhattan distance on distance2D?

I guess overall question along with that: when do I use either distance metric on the MDS algorithm?

datascience,"Hi good people of r/datascience,

I've been a long time lurker on this sub and I read most of the threads that make it on the front page.

Here's little about me, I have a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering and I've worked as a BI developer in one of the Big IT consultancies. I mainly worked on ETL - mappings/loading procedures, Visualization, SQL and some UNIX here and there. I have some experience with Big Data, Python programming + JavaScript as well.

Now I've left the organization and working on my grad school applications.

Here's my dilemma, I originally intended to apply for MS in DS programs in universities but now that I am actually applying I feel ""uneasy"", 

All this time I had a profile of Data/Business Analyst and it was pretty good so far and keeping that in mind I thought I would do good in DS as well.
But now I feel, ""What if I actually suck at DS?"" ""What if I can't do all the complex calculus, linear algebra my course work requires me to do?""

My main motivation for choosing DS was career progression. Since I've already dealt with Analyst stuff I should be progressing to the Scientist stuff. That was my thinking.

It might sound crappy but now I think that what if I legitimize my career as a BI Dev by getting a master's degree in Data/Business Analytics instead of a MS in DS.
So far I've set up data pipelines and made dashboards but as Data Scientist I'll have to make algorithms, do linear algebra/calculus stuff and maybe even do crazy amount of programming that I never did as a BI Dev.

Am I ready? What should I do?

I sure like setting up data and data engineering stuff, I was lately leaning towards AWS as well. I am not sure if I'd like the actual Data Scientist work as well.

datascience,"Hello,

I was wondering if any of you have health issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome, RSI or other (probably arthritis comes to mind) in this career.

I've been diagnosed 1 year ago. Quite unfortunate, as I've tried pursuing a more technical career 2 years ago and just shortly before I started having these problems, found my passion for programming &amp; analytics.

I'm currently working in hotel Revenue Management, which is very similar to analytics, although less technical, so a better parallel to my work would probably be Product Management.

I felt like I finally found some meaning to life, something I'm passionate about. And recently even got an offer for a job as a BI Developer, which would move me closer to a more technical job. But I turned it down, because my health problems have been getting worse.

I guess the bottom line is this - how much of a problem might these health problems be? I'm still using a keyboard and mouse in my current job, but my fear is that a more technical job will make me use them a lot more, so making my carpal tunnel  + RSI even worse.

But I might be wrong and maybe a lot of time is spent thinking about models, thinking about coding and so on. And less time clicking the mouse. I don't really have trouble with writing, it's more using the mouse. Currently have an analyst who makes most reports for me, so I don't need to do too much with the mouse. As a BI  Dev, clicking around in Tableau it would definitely be worse.

So, my choices are either:

1) follow my passion and risk getting a job in a technical sector

2) continue what I'm doing and go towards management, which I'm not so passionate about but I may not have another choice, looking 10 years in the future

3) maybe  a middle ground - get a job in the data sector, but choose one specialization which uses the least amount of mouse (and ideally keyboard, but this is just future-proofing - currently I don't have so much problems with writing, as I mentioned). so maybe a PM? (not sure if possible without actual Data Science experience). Or I was thinking Consulting, but that would probably have me do management consulting, not data consulting (again, no Data Science experience, although I've been programming + doing analytics + making strategy, forecasting etc for the past 3 years in my job - just in a less technical/math way than a DS would - I'm a business person, not a statistician)","Carpal Tunnel, RSI and other health issue obtacles in a data job",1577742799

datascience,"Hi, 

I’m currently doing inputting and analysis of questionnaire data and don’t really have much influence over the wording of the questions or the possible answers. Because the person collecting the data doesn’t really know anything about statistics / DA they are doing things which are seriously affecting the quality of the data (for example, changing the bins for answers between rounds of surveys) or adding options like ‘all my time’ for answers that are otherwise numerical. On the one hand the question changing reflect the changing understanding of the topic and it’s most likely useful for them to find out more specific info, but it obviously makes amalgamation of the rounds of questionnaires harder / less valid. 

So I’ve tried to explain about not changing answer options, why you can and can’t do with cat/num variables etc etc but it’s hard to impress this without them having a better understanding of statistics. For slightly more complex reasons it’s not possible for me to take over the design / implementation of said questionnaires, so I’m basically just left reacting to what I’m given. 

It definitely doesn’t come from a lack of interest / caring (they recently hand coded a load of questionnaire info for me, when I could’ve run it through a script in seconds...).

datascience,"[ELI5](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest) provides support for the following machine learning frameworks and packages: 

It provides support for the following machine learning frameworks and packages:

* scikit-learn. Currently ELI5 allows to explain weights and predictions of scikit-learn linear classifiers and regressors, print decision trees as text or as SVG, show feature importances and explain predictions of decision trees and tree-based ensembles. ELI5 understands text processing utilities from scikit-learn and can highlight text data accordingly. Pipeline and FeatureUnion are supported. It also allows to debug scikit-learn pipelines which contain HashingVectorizer, by undoing hashing.
* Keras - explain predictions of image classifiers via Grad-CAM visualizations.
* xgboost - show feature importances and explain predictions of XGBClassifier, XGBRegressor and xgboost.Booster.
* LightGBM - show feature importances and explain predictions of LGBMClassifier and LGBMRegressor.
* CatBoost - show feature importances of CatBoostClassifier, CatBoostRegressor and catboost.CatBoost.
* lightning - explain weights and predictions of lightning classifiers and regressors.
* sklearn-crfsuite. ELI5 allows to check weights of sklearn\_crfsuite.CRF models.

ELI5 also implements several algorithms for inspecting black-box models (see [Inspecting Black-Box Estimators](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blackbox/index.html)):

* [TextExplainer](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/black-box-text-classifiers.html) allows to explain predictions of any text classifier using [LIME](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blackbox/lime.html) algorithm (Ribeiro et al., 2016). There are utilities for using LIME with non-text data and arbitrary black-box classifiers as well, but this feature is currently experimental.
* [Permutation importance](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blackbox/permutation_importance.html) method can be used to compute feature importances for black box estimators.

Explanation and formatting are separated; you can get text-based explanation to display in console, HTML version embeddable in an IPython notebook or web dashboards, a pandas.DataFrame object if you want to process results further, or JSON version which allows to implement custom rendering and formatting on a client.

I've started a bioinformatics masters degree (I have a bachelor's in biochemistry) while working as a project coordinator and research associate and am finding that I like the data analytics electives more and think there is more opportunity there than in a bioinformatics lab. I'm learning python, R, git and SQL in the classes which seem to be some of the core skills of a data science portfolio.

Hi r/datascience,

I’m a grad student in data science at a major university. I’ve recently been questioning what is the right path for me in the field of data science.

I originally became interested in data science because I was fascinated with the ability to leverage data to surface insights and uncover truths that could drive real-world decision-making and impact. I find much of ML, on the other hand, to be tweaking models and fiddling with things to get those couple of points more of accuracy. It doesn’t feel much like uncovering truth and communicating insights at all. It feels similar to tuning up a car.  

I was wondering what paths are available for more insights-driven data science. It seems that ML is all the rage and all the jobs/internships out there are for that. I’m not sure how to tailor my education or look for roles outside of this realm.",Paths in Data Science - ML vs. Insights,1577656700
datascience,"Is there any good free PHP software for presenting graphs on a website from data from a MySQL database?

Finding Grafana is incredibly good for quickly showing data from a MySQL database. However It seems to be focussed on dashboard style / monitoring usage for logged in users. 

Is there an alternative that’s similar in style of the graphs it outputs which enables you to present the  graph data as a public website without the dashboard style interface? Preferably php and opensource. The closest I’ve found to achieving this kind of thing with graphs for a public website is chart.js but looks like a lot more effort to get graphs than Grafana where you just input SQL queries and it does all the hard work for you.

The data to be visualised is nothing to do with system monitoring and would be from publicly available transport data that is presented to a wide audience as a graph for much easier comprehension than a table, perhaps with some bespoke branding.

Like the style of graphs that Grafana produces, the api and the ability to produce images which can be automatically fed to Twitter but haven’t found anything comparable for generic data visualisation.

datascience,"First off, let me apologize for the content of this post, because I know it's something people often hate to talk about.
I am looking at data science bootcamps and online, self-teaching materials because I have a very strong interest in public health and environmental applications using data science algorithms. My background, for reference, is in the humanities and social sciences - although I do have an advanced degree (an M.A.). So, it would be quite a switch from what I am used to doing, but ultimately one I feel really strongly about. I have used free online resources to familiarize myself with basic principles, and feel that I want to delve in more fully.
As someone with a social sciences background (even though it's an M.A. from a highly respected university), I don't feel like I will be taken seriously if I self-teach. I honestly feel like I need some name or program that has vouched for me and this major shift in my educational and career goals.

So, my questions are: is this assumption correct? What bootcamps or programs might you recommend for someone like me?

As a disclaimer, I know jobs in the field can be hard without an advanced degree in the field.

datascience,"As a finance major who started his journey in this field of study completely through self-learning, here are some of the hard truths one needs to hear if they ever plan to jump into the so called hype train of ""AI"" and ""Data Science""

&amp;#x200B;

* **Data science is not just about predictions**: I see so many freshers approach me and ask me ""So I want to predict X using some Y and Z. Is that not data science?"". NO it is not data science. Data science is a multidisciplinary field which focuses on deriving maximum value from information through statistical and programming methods. It is not just predicting the outcome of some input, but it is also the art and science of understanding, dissecting and making inferences on data that can bring in fruitful value for others. Whoever markets data science to you as a ""way of predicting something"", please take their words with caution.
* **It cannot be learnt through Coursera, Udemy or any online courses**: This one is perhaps the most occurring pattern I see amongst newbies who plan to master machine learning and AI through online certifications. Let me tell you something, if these certs and courses were to make you a data scientist, every university or institution in this world which teaches students the concepts of probability theory, linear algebra, calculus from ground up has to be stupid. Machine learning and AI are extremely deep fields with a lot of intricacies in them that just can't be understood properly through online courses. Sure, the courses give us a brief primer but if you plan to apply ML or AI in any real world scenario without understanding the underlying mechanics of them, please don't. Drill the mathematics along, grind in them and understand why things are the way they are. There are millions of people working on the advancement of this field in the industry and academia, so it will be an insult to their years of hardwork and perseverance if one claimed that they understand ML or AI after going through some online courses. 
* **Stay away from the hype as much as you can**: The ever growing rush to jump into jobs of data science and machine learning because it is the hot trend floating around the market is the most gruesome form of tragedy I have taken place. The hype is created by folks who don't know jackshit about ML, AI or even statistics, atleast how I see it. In my internship, my sales manager was dumb enough to ask me to detect fraud stock transactions just by listening to the voice of the trader/broker. Like hold up, did you just ask me to singlehandedly develop a system which requires a whole department of PhD's, domain experts, ML engineers and DS's? 
* **Specialize in something**: As mentioned above, this field is immensely vast and attempting to be a godfather in machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, meta learning and whatnot, that's an overkill. Pick an area of domain which you are interested in and start exploring how statistics and machine learning is applied in it. Its better to be good at one thing and have expertise than to be that dude who claims to be good at making GAN's, fraud detection models, big data management and having supreme mastery on 5 languages. 
* **The learning shall never end**: Maybe this might sound repelling for a few here, but this is the real red pill of data science, ML and AI; the learning shall never end. There will be days where you will develop some of the most exciting and amazing models for deriving insights, but there will also be days when you will have to sit back, read the math and constantly be updated with all the progress that is happening in this field. There will be days when you will be writing amazing code that puts the whole team in awe, but there will be days where something you saw on Stackoverflow will make you wonder ""I suck at this"". Revision is the key here in this field. Don't stop learning, revise something if you have to, and keep working forward with the goal of learning. Trust me, I started out as a complete noob and after 3 years I still am a noob, just a more educated one. 
* **Stay humble**: Lastly, if you ever feel like you know a lot, just go to Kaggle notebooks, stackexchange or read some of the papers on Google Scholar or ArXiv. Simple as that.

My plan is to use my final two years of college to attempt to master (Is this even possible?) R, SQL, and Python. The courses at my college would have an emphasis on mastering Python, and I plan on working on my R and SQL skills on the side.

 Do you have any advice on what I should if I want to take on a career in Data Science? If paying for a master's in Data Science will not be a problem, would it be advantageous to pursue a master's upon graduation?

Sorry for the rambling, but my main point is that I have about two and a half years until I graduate. What skills do you advise I learn to prepare myself upon graduating (May 2022)?  I'd appreciate any advice thanks.",Sophomore Mathematics Major Want to Become a Data Scientist,1577560784
datascience,"Hi all! New data engineer supporting a new data science team. 

My team is about to launch a group of binary classification data science models. And I was looking at a side project to monitor these models and the underlying datasets. After researching this subreddit and reading a plethora of articles online, I really haven't found a solution for it. I am looking to:

1. Be notified of any shifts in the dataset.
2. Be notified of any significant decreases in model performance.
3. And if there is a decrease in performance, identify what underlying shifts in the data have caused this.

Has anyone found a good solution for this? Otherwise I'm going to build a bespoke application for this. I'll be happy to post a Python package and Docker container barring any issues from my company publishing it.

If you don't have a good solution, what else would you like to see in this application?

Thanks all!",Monitoring of Multiple Data Science Models,1577559574
datascience,"Hey all, I graduated this year from computer science and got a job as a data scientist, I'm the only data scientist in the start up  I'm working for and some of the problems they want me to tackle are kind of advanced. I have an idea on how to tackle these problems but I'd prefer if there was someone to tell me whether the direction I'm going in is the right one or not.

I'm looking for someone who has experience working on auto dispatch and algorithms for stacking items inside vehicles, or experience with churn prediction / recommendation models.

If you have experience with any of those topics but don't have time to be a mentor I'd still appreciate it if you dropped a couple of links / books to read, especially a model to stack items inside a vehicle, this is the one that I'm kind of super stumped on since the variation among items is insane and I'd like to stack them order by order, each order contains one or more items.

PS: I'm not sure if this type of post is allowed here, I checked the sidebar and there seems to be nothing against it. If it is just let me know and I'll delete it.",Fresh grad looking for a mentor,1577558009
