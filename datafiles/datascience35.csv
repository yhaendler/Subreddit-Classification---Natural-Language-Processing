Data scientist?

This was found on a business careers related subreddit. I thought this claim was crazy and outlandish, but maybe this sub could confirm. Are data scientist jobs so lax you can casually write SQL and make 250k/year?

I was always under the impression you needed a masters/PHD in stats and had to know a whole bunch of complicated math just to even break six figures, much less 250k.","User claims he is a ""data scientist"" that makes 250k/year for just writing a few SQL scripts a day. Is this false?",1592605978
datascience,"I am learning some concepts on preprocessing of datasets and have come to the filtering of near-zero variance variables. This makes sense to me, but have a conflict on how to process predictors for which I get dummy variables.

For example, I have a categorical variable with enough variance to pass the near-zero variance test, but once I convert it to dummy, some of its levels go out because are rare and their variance approaches to zero. This happens more for predictors with more levels as one would expect, so I am not entirely convinced on removing them.

Is there a general recommendation on whether filtering by near-zero variance should be carried out before or after getting dummies?",Dummy and Near zero variance variables,1592605934

datascience,"Hey everyone.

I'm about to graduate and get my masters degree next week and I have a tough decision to make. I've been working full time job for the last year in one of the biggest IT consulting companies out there as a big data intern, however my academic background is also more about analytics and statistics (i'm graduating in ""Computer Science and Econometrics"").

My main repsopnsibilites in current position are: building a star schema data warehouse (using SQL and Spark), bugfixes in existing tables, adding new source tables etc. I have never done any Kafka related stuff nor some extreamly-advanced pipelines using Spark Streaming or other tools. Most of them were quite complicated SQL queries (with over 1k lines of code). Within next 3 months the client I'm working for is going to be migrating from Hive to Snowflake and Wherscape, do you think knowing those would be benefitial to add to my resume? I would also learn some Amazon Athena and S3.

In my free time I often do kaagle competitions (just to test my skills and have some portfolio projects), prepare some ML models, try to do some predictive analysis. I really dont want to let those skills ""fade"" and develop in analytics as well.

All the technologies/languages I have worked with are: SQL, Python (more analytical python, so libraries like: numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, pandas etc.), R (although I hate it), Scala (basic scala to understand Spark better), Spark (also pySpark), Hive (Hive-QL), Apache Ariflow (althow I know how to trigger a job and read logs, not really how to write complicated scheduling scripts), Jenkins, Git, Jira.

Now, I really have a tough decision to make. Should I stay in my current job as data engineer (with promotion to regular engineer, not an intern anymore) or look into more data science field. What do you guys think would be more lucrative within the next 5-10 years? Is there any way I could lets say, within a year or two, easily change fields from data engineering to data science? I guess I would be pretty good at data preparation and cleaning in that time. Is knowlege of those technologies mentioned above superficial in case I wanted to change? Should I learn anything specific? Also, if I decide to stay in the current position, I can take certification exams in SQL and Spark. Would it be benefitial in data science? What would be the best path to take?

datascience,"Hey everyone,

I work as a DS for a fortune 100 company. It’s my first data science role and I’ve been here a little short of a year. We have no way of implementing models and I’ve built a few production worthy scoring engines. The company is trying to get up to speed with analytics and data science but is still behind in the curve in terms of technology and utilizing data and their data scientists.

This leads to my question. Is anyone else in a role where you are “looking for drivers” or “key factors” regularly. It seems as though this is a huge majority of the work and all people care about. “Looking for segments” or “tell stories”. It seems extremely trivial and the amount of work reducing extremely wide datasets to a selection of variables that can tell a story is a relatively big task. They’re so open ended and can tend to be misleading. This feels like more of a business analytics role (even though so many titles seem arbitrary). They’re looking to have a production ready environment by the end of this year but it seems that actually having the business utilize scoring engines is unlikely. 

Doing these segmentations or “drivers” of events is what stakeholders care about. Is this very common in data science? Am I looking at this position wrong?

I don't know if I completely agree with his methodology - for example, looking at the prices, the UC Berkeley [Master of Information and Data Science](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/) costs about $70k, with the  U. of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign [Master of Computer Science in Data Science](https://online.illinois.edu/mcs-ds) at about $20k. Both programs come from reputable schools with, after reviewing the curriculum, don't seem much different. However, there's a 50k difference. I know Berkeley is constantly rated #1-2 for public schools, but Illinois usually makes the top 10 for public schools as well. Considering these are online courses, I feel like the weight of the methodology should be based on cost and curriculum, as various aspects are lacking from not being on-campus. My only justification would be that Berkeley is in an area with the most data science jobs in the country, resulting in a higher likelyhood of earning a high-paying job. But then again, I think high-paying jobs are also dependent on location, with the Bay Area offering higher salaries than Chicago/Midwest.

My network structure is:

These layers should aggregate each nodes features together with their neighbours

This should return an object that is N*1 (where N is the original number of nodes). This can then be fed into a set of linear layers, with dropouts.

I am aware of the fact that switching to a major like maths, engineering etc. is obviously better for landing a job in DS. If it comes to down that I am willing to switch, but I just want to explore the option of not having to switch my major, because it's really a hassle to switch majors in Germany due to funding, paperwork and potentially moving. Also I don't mind my major, whereas I might not like maths or physics.

So my PPE curriculum actually includes R , statistics, management courses etc. and an internship. So I was wondering if anyone with interview experience can judge if that's impactful at all.

I am very thankful for everyone who takes his time and this issue serious, genuinely wants to help and discuss this! Stay safe y'all!

datascience,"Sorry if this question had been asked before, but I am kind of clueless on where to go from here. I do not have any programming, engineering, or data science background and I am in the midst of a career change. I am currently doing clinical research for a research institute but I found myself more interested in data analytics. As I look more into the field, I can envision myself doing some of its project and implements in many various directions. My end goal is to applies it into healthcare on either business or research side using analytics. Hopefully in a few years, I could apply a master program on  either CS or DS just to be more employable and gain some useful skills.

 I have self taught myself on some coding by doing career track on R and python in Datacamp, but I am having a hard time  being invested in this format as it is not very applicable to real life scenario. I heard suggestions such as kaggle, youtube, and etc., but there are so many resources that I have no idea where to go. My question to all of you,  where can I go from here after I complete career tracks from datacamp? Thank you.",How can I get started from ground zero to become a data scientist?,1592501739
datascience,"Hi all. Currently just finished my undergraduate degree in Statistics and Computer Science. Last summer I had an internship at a large company, was offered a FT position to start June 2020 as an IT Engineer for $75k a year, around $85k total comp per year. I turned the offer down since I wanted to go into more of a DS role, whereas my internship focused more on software dev, very little DS which didn't excite me at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to take a chance on myself, get an MS in Statistics and apply for DS jobs once I finish that. I was able to get into a good program, and my MS is fully funded by the research I'll be doing for the university. However, I'm a bit conflicted now as to the value that a Master's degree will have. Would my job prospects be significantly better than the offer I turned down? Is there any insight from employers as to the value added from having an MS? I don't really regret turning down the offer due to the duties I'd have to perform in my role...I think. Definitely a bit conflicted though",Struggling to determine if I made the right choice -- value added by Master's degree?,1592497844

datascience,"Hi everyone! I am currently trying to make a positive impact on the personal life of some professionals. I know from experience that working on some projects (not only as data scientist, I already posted this in different subreddits) can be very challenging, leaving a very short time for personal and dating life. 

That is why I have a couple of questions on this topic, which I believe to be very important: 

1. As a male professional, do you ever think you don’t have enough time to dedicate to your personal life?

2. What is something about your personality (if there is anything), that you think you could improve when it comes to meeting and attracting women (or men)?

To be clear: I am just getting started with this, not trying to sell you anything with these questions! I am simply particularly interested in the topic. I would really like to get your valuable insights, so that maybe a tailored solution can be provided in the future!

datascience,"So I think it needs no explaining that a model trained on a data set can overfit and provide false impressions of model performance. That's where cross-validation comes in. It paints a more honest (usually less optimistic) picture of generalization error.

I was surprised to discover that in Kaggle notebooks and other places, the Train/Test/Holdout scheme is widespread, sometimes even hailed as the gold standard.

The terminology differs between sources, so let me be clear: I am referring to the following protocol. The analyst divides the data into three parts. The train and test set are used to build the model. The analyst first trains the model on the train set, before evaluating on the test set. And so on, for a couple of iterations, each time seeking to reduce the generalization error of the model. Importantly, the holdout set never comes into contact with the model until the very end (to prevent data leakage). It is used once and only once to provide a final estimate of model performance.

Now I don't think this approach is fundamentally wrong. Rather, it seems there are better alternatives.

I see two problems with the random partitioning of the data into 3 parts. First, the partitioning of the data can decide the model. Consider what would happen if all the outliers fell in the holdout set (or the training set). Well, the model would suffer because of that. If another analyst had a more balanced partitioning of outliers due to chance, their model would appear to have the better performance.

Second, the stochastic behavior of many models (such as random forests) means a single validation score on a holdout sample is necessarily subject to variability.

For these reasons I have long preferred **repeated k-fold cross-validation** instead. The *repeated* random partitioning of folds strengthens estimates of model performance and allows the model performance to regress toward the mean over many trials (law of large numbers).

So I believe repeated k-fold cross-validation provides strictly better estimates than the train/test/holdout method, while having the disadvantage of being computationally intensive.

Caveat: there is a need for the train/test/holdout method in the sciences, since a single holdout test offers a chance to benchmark different methods in prediction and classification. I am speaking of the general case.

However, like those fields data science also deals with a lot of well, data.

I was wondering if there is some overlap between those areas.

datascience,"Data is the necessity of the modern industry. The mechanism of the  flow of both structured and unstructured information into workable  insights with scientific approaches and methodology can be termed as  data science in simple words. The procedure involves subjects combining  machine learning, algorithms, statistics, programming, and mathematics  to draw raw information and transform it into usable data. Data Science  has its dominance over major industries in the world. Perceiving the  usable data from the raw version with the latest technology is the task  performed by the data scientists.  
**Healthcare**  
The Healthcare industry is the most benefited industry of data science. Data science  is used in detecting several ailments like tumors, infection, organ  malfunction, and more. It applies processes like machine learning for  medical image indexing and medical analysis for report classification.  From computerizing reports, medical image analysis to genetic disease  exploration data science has given a whole new meaning to medical  science.   
**Banking**  
This sector was the earliest adopters of information technology (IT)  for processes and data security. The data available to banks for  transactions are numerous and complex. The implementation of data  science in the banking industry has led to better management of the data  flowing in from different sources. Internet banking and mobile banking  have been easier with the help of data science.  
**Transport and Logistic**  
Data  science has its implementation in logistics companies such as DHL, FedEx and more to enhance their operational efficiency and streamlining  businesses. With the assistance of data science, companies know the best  of shipment, time to deliver, methods of transport for picking up, and a  lot more. Data science, moreover introduced the utilization of the GPS system giving them a lot more outcomes to investigate utilizing data science.  
**Image Recognition and Speech Recognition**  
The  application of data science can be found in the image and speech  recognition field. The automated notification or suggestion feature is  carried out by an algorithm commonly known as face recognition.  Similarly, Google also offers the search option for images by uploading  them. Speech recognition works in the same manner. Some instances are  Google Voice, Siri, and more. By using the speech-recognition feature,  one can easily avoid typing a message. Simply speaking out the message  will help to convert the information into text.  
The application and role of data science haven’t evolved overnight. Data mining  from multiple sources is a challenging task. The raw data comes in  various formats and is unstructured. The application of data science is  not limited to these industries only. It is also utilized in gaming,  augmented reality, advertisement, and marketing.
