Background: I was working on a project recently that employed complex survey analysis. It was delegated to us by another company. I was assigned to it under this DS who is further up in the company. As we started working on the project, I've mentioned multiple times that I've done a very similar analysis before on this data because they said they've never done it before. My experience seemed to be ignored because when we spoke to the other company, they were requesting all sorts of odd things that totally goes against appropriate CSA methodology for what they want to do with it. After that meeting I've brought it up to that project supervisor (re: the upper level DS) that the methodology is inappropriate. But they insisted to just do it how they requested.

* Should I learn more about Financial related topics in Data Science (at a personal level I am interested in this I would like to use Data Science + Finance for trading in a personal portfolio but this will have no use in the organization I am working in since that organization is Marketing oriented ).

* Should I learn Julia ?
* Should I learn Pyspark (It seems many job positions ask for it and it may have some applications in my organization).

datascience,"This is something I've been thinking for a while and feel needs to be said. The title ""data scientist"" now is what the title ""Web Master"" was back in the 90s. 

For those unfamiliar with a Web Master, this title was given to someone who did graphic design, front and back end web development and SEO - everything related to a website. This has now become several different jobs as it needs to be.  

Data science is going through the same thing. And we're finally starting to see it branch out into various disciplines. So when the often asked question, ""how do I become a data scientist"" comes up, you need to think about (or explore and discover) what part(s) you enjoy.

For me, it's applied data science. I have no interest in developing new algorithms, but love taking what has been developed and applying it to business applications. I frequently consult with machine learning experts and work with them to develop solutions into real world problems.  They work their ML magic and I implement it and deliver it to end users (remember, no one pays you to just do data science for data science sake, there's always a goal).

datascience,"1. I was recently contacted by a recruiter from a FANG company.  Why now and never before?
2. I took the call with the intention to learn how did they found me. The answer: LinkedIn.
3. Two years ago while I was looking for a job, I  tweaked my LinkedIn with popular keywords and It didn't do much difference.
4. I am getting many good offers on LinkedIn, without any changes to my profile, which I haven't got before.  What changed?
5. My theory is: I am doing a lot of self-promotion on LinkedIn (with blogs) and people interact with and profile. When a recruiter searches for a DS, LinkedIn ranks my profile higher as it has many interactions.
6. So the key takeaway is: self-promote on LinkedIn so that the ranking algorithm will rank you higher.  Just tweaking your profile doesn't help.

Another easier alternative: Just try to find a friend there or an acquaintance and ask for a referral.   Note: this won't make the process after (getting hired) easier, though.

With that in mind, I've created a complete course on the fundamentals of data analysis with SQL, that I'm offering for free on Udemy through the end of the month:

https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-basics-crash-course-with-sql-server/?couponCode=LEARN-SQL-FOR-FREE

As a self-taught SQL programmer, I’ve learned the hard way that all the books, videos, and articles in the world won’t help without LOTS of structured practice, i.e. coding exercises. So I've included nearly 100 coding exercises in the course, covering every fundamental aspect of SQL programming.

And I walk through every subject in bite-sized videos ( averaging less than 10 minutes in length). Every concept is built up step by step, with no hand-waving at intermediate topics.

datascience,"I am currently working on a problem that involves improving an already deployed binary classification model.

And I have come across with the following:

We are trying to predict if a certain task is going to be abandoned or completed by the person who accepted it in the first place.

So our target variable is the abandonment/completion of the task itself.

And I have come across another feature in the dataset which is the average % of abandoment of that person.

And this feature is troubling me: because if we look at the training process this feature which is the total number of abandoment/completed tasks has the information about what the model needs to predict.

Not only that but it is has the highest importance.

If we isolate ourselves from the training process and look at the predicting moment this stops being an issue since at that moment in time we are taking this feature as the past behaviour of that person and using to predict the outcome, however during the training process, since this feature isn't being treated as a time series variable it's feeding future information to past predictions.

Which brings me to my question: How could I solve this issue? Tell them they a mistake in the working model and drop that feature, find a way to implement this feature as a time series variable? 

I've tested the model without it and the recall which is the metric being used to track the performance really gets hit.","Feature Leakage, how to handle it?",1601301167

datascience,"The other day I was jogging along the coastal walk in Bondi, taking in the ocean view and getting my evening exercise. I couldn’t help but notice a guy run past me built like a Greek God. He was massive, and sculpted, and clearly spent a lot of time working out. This guy must have spent hours every day pumping iron, watching what he ate, and caring what other people thought of his figure.

Now this guy deserves respect for his dedication. But with a fraction of the effort, everyone else jogging was getting most of the benefits he was. Everyone was taking a break from their day’s labors, getting enough exercise to be reasonably fit and healthy, and enjoying the view of the ocean. The only part they were missing out on was the perfection (in the words of Ronnie Coleman-- “Lightweight baby”).

Newcomers to coding and data science often take Adonis’ approach. They strive for perfection and they want to hit every single muscle (learn all the syntax). However in many parts of the business world, the Golden Rule is 80/20 “Get the most out of the least effort”. This is especially true with SQL, where a minority of the syntax covers most of the use cases.

When I started my first job I was handed a textbook to learn to code. It was a waste of time and counterproductive. So I wrote a course to solve that problem.

As the title kinda implies, I am a 30m ex-med student who decided not to practice medicine about 4 months before graduating from med school (this was about 18 months ago).  After leaving, kinda been bouncing around trying out different things on the business/analytical side of healthcare as it seems more fitting of my personality (health admin for 8 months, consulting internship for 3 months, etc.).  Recently a friend of mine working on developing AI for a pharma company put me onto becoming a data scientist with a specialization in healthcare.  From his description of the job, it seems right down my alley as I love the concept of using technology/AI to analyze and interpret massive amounts of data by making sure I, as the coder, ask the right questions in the right way. Obviously, I have the medical knowledge to fulfill the role, but I am concerned about my technical ability, or lack thereof.  I have always enjoyed technology and have a pretty good but basic understanding of computers from PC gaming in my early 20s, but absolutely no experience with coding.  So I guess my question would be, how hard/how long did it take people to feel proficient with coding/python?  Do I need to have a CS degree (or just a strong background in CS) to even becoming proficient in coding? I kinda just wanna know if jumping in head first into coding can lead me down a successful career path, or would I just be wasting my time?
