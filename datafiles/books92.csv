Then it kept happening. The main character is a young, snarky girl who challenges everyone and every thing. And dresses rough. What started out as subversion is now, I feel, a cliche.

I've been taking an interest in reading more and more classical books over the last few years, thanks to the help of guides that help go thru the books in detail and comment on them as we go (spoiler-free). Some of the ones I've found are the following:

* The *Les Miserables* Reading Companion ([**https://readlesmis.libsyn.com/website**](https://readlesmis.libsyn.com/website)**)**
* The Ulysses Guide ([http://www.ulyssesguide.com/](http://www.ulyssesguide.com/)) and a different, but related playlist from Chris Reich on YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxlGs\_Xj2HYA8P6E2Jy6Ub9m7eqs-9lcU](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxlGs_Xj2HYA8P6E2Jy6Ub9m7eqs-9lcU)**)**
* The 100 Canto / 100 Video Project from TOM LA Books ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpiUReQm8Y8a6EVTuhjE6KK7dnS\_IaPud](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpiUReQm8Y8a6EVTuhjE6KK7dnS_IaPud))
* Yale's course on Don Quixote ([https://oyc.yale.edu/spanish-and-portuguese/span-300](https://oyc.yale.edu/spanish-and-portuguese/span-300))

I was hoping to get some other recommendations from this sub with either YouTube playlists/podcasts/websites that pick a book and go pretty indepth into it. It helps me personally to dive into a work and get as detailed and thorough as possible before moving on to the next one. If nothing else, I hope the community benefits from the above recommendations that I've encountered.

This book is a simple story on deep themes. The plot could have been told in a much shorter form, and yet the writing is so precise -- almost no scene, detail or element is out of place. The rhythm of the book takes the reader through the growing up of Josie and Klara -- human and android (although technically robots cannot ""grow"" as they aren't biological).


To me, the true growth here is of the reader: either getting acquainted with a Black Mirror-esque near future, or receiving light dosage of provocative thoughts on contemporary scientific topics (enhancing people genetically; remote learning; change of the labour market; suburb-inization; and more).


All of these are portrayed with a beautiful background, that for some reason reminds me of Kansas (ie. the way it shows in film at least).

Kennedy in the Barrio

My sixth-grade class had been assigned to watch the Kennedy inauguration on television and I did so at the counter of Puerto Habana, the restaurant where my father worked. The heard the Cuban owner Larry Reyes say that an Irish Catholic being elected meant that someday an Hispano could be president in the United States too. I saw my father nod in automatic agreement with the boss, but his eyes were not on the grainy screen; he was mainly concerned with the food cooking in the back and with the listless waitress mopping the floor. Larry Reyes turned his attention to me then and raised his cup as if to make a toast: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to a puertorrique√±o or puetorrique√±a president of the United States,‚Äù he laughed, not kindly, I thought.

‚ÄòRight, Elenita?‚Äô

I shrugged my shoulders. Later my father would once again reprimand me for not showing Mr. Reyes the proper respect.

Two years and ten months later I would run to Puerto Habana on a cold Friday afternoon to find a crowd around the television set. Many of them, men and women both, were sobbing like children. ‚ÄúDios m√≠o, dios m√≠o,‚Äù they kept wailing. A group of huddling women tried to embrace me as I made my way to my parents, who were holding each other tightly, apart from the others. I slipped in between them. I smelled her scene of castile soap, caf√© con leche, and cinnamon; I inhaled his mixture of sweat and Old Spice cologne‚Äîa man smell that I was afraid to like too much.",Kennedy in the Barrio by Judith Ortiz Cofer,1617550216

books,"I should probably begin with how much I appreciate the writing technique. It really felt like I was time travelling with Billy. I think it's a work of a genius to accomplish such a task. It was very unique for me atleast.

I also understood that Billy was not merely time travelling, he was going through PTSD. He is a broken man with fragmented and painful memories of the war. After coming home from the war he admitted himself into the hospital. He doesn't feel happy and feels guilty to his mother for that. So much that he doesn't know how to face her. When his wife dies he stops speaking for days. I think this is the point where he is completely broken and comes up with alien stories to deal with the grief and loss of his wife. I think it was interesting that he starts reading the sci-fi books when he was in hospital and he starts to incorporate those stories in his life when he was in hospital. Maybe that's how he made the connection? His nihilism is also evident with how he agrees with whatever the war veteran who was writing about war said to justify the bombings in Dresden. It's like he only wanted to be believed that he was there. That he has suffered and witnessed the hell. So much that he doesn't feel anything now.

And the wisdoms of Tralfamadorians on how to live a happy life is something that I'm trying to follow diligently. To just focus on good moments and ignore the bad ones. I also liked the message to have serenity to accept the things you can't change, courage to change the things you can and wisdom to know the difference.

When I first heard about this novel it was termed as anti-war book. The sequence of watching war movie in reverse was very hard hitting and beautifully done. This book didn't portray the soldiers as heros and there was nothing glorifying about the war.
But I wish there was something more. Maybe it's because of all the hype that my expectations were very high and I felt unsatisfied when I was done reading? I mean, I know war is never good. Killing innocent people to avengs innocent people is stupid. But that's the thing : I already KNOW it. I think I was looking for some revelation that I didn't find. 

My main gripe is that I didn't feel emotionally invested or connected to any of the characters. Not even with Billy. I didn't feel anything. And I feel so bad for that. I feel like I'm missing out on something and I feel so disappointed.

Anyway, I would really love it if someone could help me find the author of the book that brought me to tears, the details of which I shall outline now:

It's a fantasy novel, a coming of age, where a young adult is in rebellion, raised as a foster child in a sort-of medieval setting. 

What transpires is that the young adult is of a special breed, one that commands the attention of a wild animal which bonds with them. In this instance, it was a wolf. The protagonist is orphaned, an outcast in a world if semi-royalty.

Human and animal can communicate because of their bond. Whether it's a spiritual animal, or an actual animal eludes me. Apparently, there are many of these people but they don't exactly advertise their abilities.

It's the way the author wrote this connection that tugged at my heartstrings. I know the author was a lady.

books,"I just finished reading The Institute by Stephen King, it usually takes me around an hour to read 30 pages, I really like to picture everything that's being described and I had 60 pages until the end so I decided to power through before I go to bed. 

The book is about a government facility where the staff kidnaps kids and do experiments on them, the reason being the children have psychic abilities. Telepathy and telekinesis. We follow the story of Luke Ellis, a very bright 12 year old who gets taken in the middle of the night and wakes up in the institute confused, tired, and scared. During his (horrible) stay he meets other kids and forms an unbreakable bond with them and makes friends with the biggest hero in the book (in my opinion) Avery, aka, the Avester!

 The institute is broken up into two buildings, front half, and back half. In front half, where Luke wakes up, there are horrible test and experiments done on the children, but compared to what happens in back half, these experiments are nothing. Luke decides he has had enough with the sadistic tests, the abusive staff, and makes a daring escape. Chaos soon follows and you discover that maybe Luke's escaping of this awful place might lead to the end of the world!

I'll leave my description of the book at that, and I hope it has enticed you enough to pick it up. If you like Stephen King or the Netflix show Stranger Things, then I think you'll love this. The way Stephen writes these characters and scenarios really makes you empathise with them, and he makes you feel like you part of the group at the institute. Thank you for taking the time to read my post, and if you decide to read the book, I promise you you won't be disappointed :)
