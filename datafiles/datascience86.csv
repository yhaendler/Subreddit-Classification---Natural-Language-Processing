A lot of them are getting better constantly and the work as a data scientist in product companies shifts from building these models to knowing which companies are out there to solve the problem.

There are still some very unqie problems that require custom solutions, but as the number of AI startups grows and the giants are offering more and more use cases in their cloud solutions, the work for us is getting less. A lot of internal models, we built in the past years can now be replaced by specialized external tools. (fraud detection, risk scoring, nlp tasks and even image classification)

Usually when a project in our company requires some ML, we were asked to find a solution, but today the most interesting problems are nowadays solved by specialized companies, having many customers and therefore more data and a highly specialized team to solve the issue. Oftentimes their salespeople are also overpromising, but in the end leaders often prefer to use their solutions, instead of building something custom. So, we end up losing a lot of the highly interesting use cases to external competitors, making them even better with our data.

the title might be a bit confusing so let me explain myself better. R can be very easily connected with SQL Server to fetch raw data.

However, since I am no expert in R and I still read lots of documentation on internet etc... very often I see people who swear to god that dplyr / tidyverse changed their life and wondered how they could work before without these tools.

Now, I am sure I miss something but... If I already prepare, clean, merge, etc.. the raw data with T-SQL and just run a query to fetch the resutls in R.. Are there still reasons that I am missing for which it would make sense to ""explore"" the tidyverse?

datascience,"This is a topic that I have discussed heavily in the past, and I constantly see it popping up as a question and source of confusion among the community, asking what exactly is the bias-variance tradeoff, why is it called that, and how do you actually define them in objective terms? I was lucky enough to have a professor in my university days by the name of Shai-Ben David that has an excellent textbook titled *Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms* that is theoretically oriented, and it had the best definition of the bias-variance tradeoff that I have seen to this day, which is a topic that I think is heavily misunderstood today, though I would love to hear the opinions of others that might disagree with me.

**Common misconception:** For example, I have seen people define the bias-variance tradeoff as referring to the variance of outputted predictions of your model relative to small local changes to input features. However, we all know that variance refers to the overfitting error, and this definition would imply that a constant-predictor model *f(x) = k* that simply outputs a constant value (parameter that is learned) would have a variance of zero, and therefore will not overfit? Even if it is given a training set with only a single example, it will not overfit at all? This definition clearly does not make sense. I think it is common to see highly overfit models with high variance that also happen to have highly volatile predictions relative to small changes in input features, however that is NOT a requirement nor is it a good definition.

**Another common misconception:** Another common definition of bias-variance or overfitting-underfitting that I have seen before is usually referring to models that have a learning curve over the course of their training (usually neural networks or ensemble models) where you can see the training error and validation error change over the course of training. Typically, the training error always improves, while the validation error improves for a while until it reaches its 'peak validation performance' iteration and then the validation error starts getting worse while training keeps improving. Sometimes, people will refer to the model iterations BEFORE the 'peak validation' as being underfitting or high bias, and then refer to the model iterations AFTER the 'peak validation' as being overfitting or high variance. I understand why people often make this association and confusion, but again it doesn't make much sense. Why are model iterations before considering underfitting while the iterations after are overfitting? Does this mean that the 'peak validation' iteration is not overfitting or underfitting? How do you even define bias/variance for models that don't have a learning curve? There is a lot lacking here.

**So then, what is the bias-variance tradeoff?**

The bias variance trade-off is a useful concept that stems from decomposing the generalisation error. Before we can understand this, we need to define a few concepts that are important.

First, we need to frame the training of a model as a mathematical process. What are we doing when we take a linear regression model and feed it a bunch of training data? One way to look at this, is that we have a model hypothesis class *H = { f(x) = kx + m | for all k,m }* which is the set of all possible simple univariate linear regression models that we could learn. Then, training a model, is basically running a TrainingAlgorithm that takes in the training dataset as input and outputs a model *f(x)* that is from the hypothesis class *H*. So basically, *H* is the set of all possible models, and training a model is basically trying to find the best model in *H* that fits our training data best and that we think will generalise the best.

Given those definitions, we can now define the key terms that we need to bring it all together.

**What is generalisation error?**

The generalisation error, in this example, is the error that we expect to observe by training a linear regression model on the training dataset that we have and deploying it on future unseen data examples drawn from the target distribution. Basically, it is the true error of the model that we will have. The reason that we have a 'test set' is so we can estimate the generalisation error. Now, thankfully, smarter people than me have gone ahead and done a bunch of mathematical wizardry to decompose the generalisation error into the following definition:

*GeneralisationError = TrueError + Bias + Variance*

Note that *Bias = UnderfittingError* and *Variance = OverfittingError*

***What is TrueError?***

TrueError is defined as the underlying error of the target distribution. For example, suppose that we are given training data from the target distribution of samples (x, y) where y = 5x + 2. Then we can clearly see that this can be perfectly predicted (if we know the underlying true distribution and can model it), and the TrueError would be 0. However, for another example, maybe the target distribution is y = 5x + 2 + u, where u is a random Normal variable with mean 0 and variance 1. Well clearly, even if we know the true underlying distribution, we won't be able to perfectly predict it because of the underlying error of the target distribution, and the TrueError is equal to the variance of the random variable u.

**What is Bias?**

Bias is defined as the difference between the generalisation error of the BEST model from our hypothesis class *H and the* underlying *TrueError*. For example, if the true underlying target distribution is y = 5x + 2, then we can see that our model class of simple linear regression models *H* contains this exact model! So therefore, the best model instance is *f(x) = 5x + 2* where *f in* H, and we can see that our Bias/UnderfittingError is equal to 0! As you can see, *Bias* or the *Underfitting Error* is basically the error introduced by choosing our model hypothesis class *H.* If our hypothesis class contains the true target distribution model, then our bias will be 0, otherwise the farther our 'best' model in the class is from the true underlying target distribution, then the higher our bias will be. Notice that this definition has nothing to do with the volatility of the model output predictions, and has nothing to do with the learning curve.

**What is Variance?**

Variance is defined as the difference between the generalisation error of the BEST model from our hypothesis class *H* and the error of the EXPECTED model that will be learned from our class *H* given the finite training set of size *N* that is fed into the training algorithm. To continue with our example from above, we know that the best model in our class *H* is the model instance *f(x) = 5x + 2*. However, suppose that we are given a training set of size 1 with only a single sample of (x,y). Given only 1 sample, our training algorithm may choose the model instance *f(x) = 4x + 1*, which is worse than our best model and will have higher generalisation error. The difference between the expected GE of our model trained on the dataset of size 1 and the expected GE of our 'best model' is the variance or overfitting error component of the GE. Notice how the variance is dependent on the model hypothesis class *H*, the training algorithm *A,* and the size of the training dataset. This is why we can reduce overfitting by increasing the size of our training dataset, or we can reduce overfitting by reducing the size of our model hypothesis class (by choosing a simpler model or adding regularization which typically reduces the size of the model hypothesis class).

**TL;DR:** An accurate mathematical exact definition of underfitting/overfitting A.K.A the bias-variance tradeoff is useful to understand even beyond a theoretical context. For a more comprehensive understanding, I recommend that you read the textbook I mentioned at the beginning of the post.",Mathematical definition of the bias-variance tradeoff,1614736458

The aim of this project is to get the probability of an event occurs (a goal in a soccer match, because I like soccer and that could be an incentive to learn faster), given certain circumstances. 

Basically I want to know the probability of a goal occurs if: it's raining, the elapsed time of the match and if the team with the ball is losing the match. As you can see, I have continuous and categorical independent variables. I know that, for continuous variable, I could just make a linear regression. But my aim is to get all of this variables into the same model. 

My doubts: what are the best models or theories I could use, which the output is a probability prediction? What models can be fitted with those different types of data?

(I've already studied about logistic regression, but in that case the output is a prediction whether there is or there isn't a goal, and what I want is the probability of that goal occurring in each scenario. I thought about putting this logistic regression prediction into a Monte Carlo simulation, but I don't know if it's feasible or even if the prediction will change after each simulation. I don't know if this simulation would answer my questions either).
