datascience,"Hey all, I’m just looking for some general advice. I graduated a few years ago with a double major in Geologic Sciences and Geographic Information Systems. 

I worked a couple of years in materials science and the last year in oil &amp; gas field operations. I was just laid off and returned to my parents place near NYC. I’m think of using this forced hiatus to apply to Data Analytics/Science &amp; Business Analytics masters programs in the CUNY system. I’m almost 2/3rds of the way through a program in ‘Earth Data Analytics’, which is really just python for remote sensing. I took it because i wanted some formal training in python.

Anyone have any advice for leveraging GIS and remote sensing skills in data analytics? Any opinions on how I should proceed?",Moving into data,1586044751

datascience,"I have a website that organizes factual claims and allows the community to rate them based on objective qualities.  One current feature associated with each claim is called ""topics"".  I'm considering a redesign where topics are calculated automatically based on the contents of the claim, its sources, and its evidence provided.

Technology is no bother for me, as I built the website from the ground up.  However, I know next to nothing about data science.  I've spent most of today researching where I even need to begin.

What I think I'm looking for is called Text Classification.  Here's what I imagine my process would look like.

1. Certain users sometimes enter topics with each claim.  When they do, the back-end will take that opportunity to train a model with the user provided topics.  Maybe I have to spend some time training the model myself, which is fine.  Who trains it doesn't matter, but I would like the model to be trained against a specific set of topics.  This could eventually be in the thousands.
2. Certain users take advantage of auto-tagging of topics, and the claim document is then submitted to the text classification service by the back-end where it will predict one to many topics automatically.
3. Depending on other services provided by the text classification solution, it may also be used for fuzzy searching and trending topics.

Here's where I'm uncertain:

1. Am I on the right track with text classification as the right solution to this problem?  I've seen several tools for ""text annotation"" but those seem more interactive, and tied to recognizing existing named entities, whereas I want to train the model against a more tailored lexicon (train a document against a topic/category/label/whatever).
2. Most examples I saw while researching only used one topic to train one document, and got only one topic in return when predicting a document.  I am looking for a solution where I can provide many topics per doc in training, and get many topics back when predicting.
3. Does training end, or is it continuous?  Is there such a thing as over-training?  I'd also need to factor in storage size for trained topics, especially if it is continuous.
4. Can text classification be used to determine topics that are trending and fading?  Or, is that a different data science approach/solution?
5. I think I found what I need in GCP [AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl) Natural Languare Processing API, but it is too expensive ($5 per 1000 doc predictions!?).
6. And, assuming I'm on the right track with all of this, does anyone know of any production-ready service API's or docker images out there, or even libraries I could integrate with or build a service around?  I'm technology agnostic and am comfortable in many languages including python.  But, most everything I've found seems one-off, white-paper-ish, experimental, small-scale (i.e. in-memory only), etc...  Here are the ones that seemed closest to what I want to do:
   1. [natural](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural) \- node toolsuite with most everything I think I need, but would need to build up persistence storage and run benchmarking to assess its scalability.
   2. [prodi.gy](https://prodi.gy) \- Seems more UI human interaction focused, rather than API driven.  And, not sure about custom lexicon given the emphasis on general annotation.
   3. [tagtog](https://www.tagtog.net/) \- Same comments as [prodi.gy](https://prodi.gy), but  got excited when I saw they had a docker image. Didn't seem like the right solution for my problem, though.
   4. [cortex](https://www.cortex.dev/) \- AWS based, service based, but wasn't clear on how they offer text classification at all.  I wondered if I could makeshift their sentiment analysis just using a custom  topics.  I could work with AWS, but it's not my first choice
   5. [monkeylearn.com](https://monkeylearn.com) and various other services that aren't upfront about pricing or are just too expensive.
   6. [xgboost.readthedocs.io](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io) \- here's one that I believe is production ready and \*probably\*, but I have a hard time figuring out what the heck it does or what I do with it!
   7. [klassify](https://github.com/fatiherikli/klassify) \- This one seemed the most straightforward, and closest to what I'm trying to do, has a docker image, works with redis, and so it seems scalable.  But, I wasn't sure if anyone had any experience with it or if it meets my requirement of pulling multiple topics out of one document (at first glance it only seems to work with one).

Appreciate any help on the matter!  I have a [sandbox](https://sandbox.thinkards.org) up if that helps gauge what the website abilities are.  I'm aware the UI/UX needs some work, and I am working on it (that's at least two things I'm clueless on)!

datascience,"When I chose this career path as my trajectory, it wasn't originally out of subject matter interest. I picked it because all signs indicated it was destined for explosive growth. The number of DS jobs indeed has exploded, likewise, the volume of free and paid educational material has surged. Through my progression, I've come to really enjoy the work environment/types of problems. 

But this is starting to look a but like the 90s ""dot-com"" bubble to me. (It's okay to disagree with me, I really want to be wrong here!)

Here are some thoughts:

\- Companies like Google and Amazon were using what's now ""data science"" long before such a term gained traction. (For example, google's pagerank algorithm that put them on the map.) So why did the demand inflate \~20 years later?

\- Most businesses, even established ones in tech sector (ie SAP), don't know how to gainfully employ a data scientist and have few subject matter expert within their ranks. I interned with SAP some time ago and I was the only DS person in the building, \*as an intern\*. My judgment was literally unchecked by anyone more experienced. I definitely made some green horn mistakes. 

\- The amount of educational resources far exceeds the market demand available. Further, why is Jose Portilla (Udemy instructor) making a living off of teaching DS? (If the skills were so valuable in the industry, why not rise through the ranks and become a FAANG chief data scientist?) -- in other words, the educational DS market is beginning to look like a pyramid scheme.

\- There's no established credentials that determine success. I've seen self-taught people do incredible work, but only because they put the hours into learning calc, linear algebra, and probability theory in f*irst*, before jumping into neural nets, probabilistic graphical models, etc. Likewise, I've seen friends in MSCS programs only superficially master the domain because they tried to learn too many models but none in any appreciable depth.

\- Most companies don't have ""big data"" problems. Some do. Most have catacombs full of excel spreadsheets with varying column lengths and names, different levels of data aggregation (ie weekly/monthly/quarterly reports) and often overlapping time frames.    

\- And most dangerously, established tech companies (not startups!) seem to be the most insulated from the economic effects of covid-19. (My guess is because a higher proportion of the workforce can work from home and the product isn't tangible so it doesn't require physical interaction.) My prediction - the candidate pool for DS roles is going to surge in the next 6-12 months with respect to a limited job pool.

\- As a second order consequence of the above, the ambiguous entry requirements for DS roles will suddenly congeal as a function of supply/demand. All of a sudden, PhD in CS or statistics won't be ""preferred"" it will be ""required."" And this is really when I foresee the bubble bursting. If it becomes common belief that MOOCs are inadequate for passing the first round HR screenings , the DS educational market will collapse and data science will be eclipsed by the ""next big thing.""

\- Another possible covid-19 consequence. All of our predictions for 2020 customer churn, sales volume, etc is likely entirely wrong. Experienced data scientists command a decently high salary. But if a year's worth of model predictions flop, companies will lose faith in the cost/benefits of staffing data scientist. They might just trim down to 1-2 experienced roles, virtually eliminating all entry level roles (of those that even remain!)

Honestly, I really do want to be wrong here. But the hair on the back of my neck is standing up. My gut instinct, hedge my bets by picking up some software development skills; brush up on DS&amp;A, master a web development framework.

I'll pick it up if there really aren't any other theory-focused programs out there, but I'd rather not spend a year learning a language I probably won't ever use in a job.*

Does anyone have any other recommendations? Or is a stats degree what I need? And if so, does anyone have recommendations for that?

datascience,"At my work, I have access to a large dataset of salesperson call recordings, I'm very interested to hear what everyone things about how to business value might extracted from these data. Just looking for general thoughts and ideas. Recommendations for specific papers and code projects are helpful, but I also need to in general terms what types of things are possible with a dataset like this.

I work as a data analyst on a sales and marketing team. The sales team consists of 130 sales representatives, and each sales rep spends a few hours per day on the phone, calling leads, developing and maintaining relationships with current customers, and just in general trying to grow sales.

Nearly every call is automatically recorded in full, and a lot of background information can be related to the call; for example the customer history, the lead's job title, marketing and website engagement history and more.

It seems like there has to be a way to extract useful information from these call recordings. There is so much data, there could be 300 or more hours of call recordings generated every day.

Here are a few things that are often on the team's mind:

* How do we coach sales reps differently to improve lead conversion rates?
* How can the phone call performance of sales reps be quantified?
* Which of our hundreds of products are people the most interested in?
* What are customers saying about our products?
* What product categories are being discussed in sales calls right now?
* When we lose sales opportunities, for what reasons did we lose them?
* How can we forecast future sales?

For what reasons are some of our leads not able to be contacted by sales reps, e.g. how often is the phone number bad versus how often is the call being shut down by a secretary?

Generally, I don't like backing into the use of a dataset, it is much better to have a question and then use data to try to answer the question than to have a dataset and come up with a question...

...but there is so much information embedded in these call records, I just can't stop thinking that there must be a way to extract business value here.

A little bit about my background is relevant - I'm fluent in Python (preference), can pick up new programming languages if there is a good reason to. I have a good background in math and am more than happy to bootstrap new concepts in that domain as well. I'm the only one on my team with this type of background.

What methodologies should I start to experiment with? Are there cloud-based services that could be useful? Is this even a good use of time, maybe the data isn't really that valuable?",What to do with a large dataset of sales call audio recordings,1585920830

I like to make the following assumptions for the model

* It takes the form of a Gaussian function with 3 parameters: the mean, standard deviation and the altitude.

`def gauss(x, mean, std, altitude):`

`return (np.exp(-np.square(x - position) / (2 * np.square(std)))) * altitude`

* The respective intervals for these parameters are predefined as \[0, 50\], \[0, 50\] and \[0, 2000\].

Because of these priors I assume a Bayesian model is preferred over a Frequentist one. I also like to include uncertainty.

So the next thing I did was sample uniformly from these 3 parameters many times, and calculated the resulting error (RMSE) on the data. I did this 100k times:

This gives insight in the promising parameter regions. But how to I go from here to actually sample good parameters?

Should I create a gaussian function per parameter? Or a multivariate one for all three? And how?

I have heard that Data Science MS programs are new and therefore haven't been tested in the market with regards to employability while Statistics MS have been around for a long time and are a safer bet.  I've been accepted to Brown's Data Science program and BU's Master of Statistical Practice program with a considerable amount of financial assistance at BU.  I'm waiting to hear on one more school(Rutgers) that had a very late deadline.  If I go to Rutgers I'll pay in-state tuition and its also a more traditional Statistics program from what I understand.  It's 3 semesters with the option to pursue a PhD whereas Brown and BU are more professional programs.  Also I should mention that I've been working for awhile since my undergrad and regardless of where I go I will not have to take out any loans.  Is the Ivy League price tag worth it?  Is it risky to go to a relatively new program(Brown or BU) that hasn't been around long enough to really be tested?

The University of San Francisco is my top candidate right now because it is in the hub of innovation, is one of the value schools, clear post-graduation outcomes, one-year, small little scholarship. My second candidate is the University of Michigan because of its proximity to home, value, and strong engineering ranking.
