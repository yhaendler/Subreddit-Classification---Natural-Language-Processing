datascience,"Hi All,

We have just released MLFinLab 0.8.0 which includes a couple of bug fixes and the new [Tail Set Labeling technique](https://mlfinlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/implementations/labeling_tail_sets.html).

Additionally, we have started a [mentorship program](https://hudsonthames.org/mentorship/) that caters to ambitious students looking to make an impact on open-source and develop a portfolio of work based on financial machine learning.

Finally, we ran a poll to figure out which verticals to focus on for 2020, below are the results.

I must say, I am very surprised by the results. I thought that portfolio optimization was going to dominate. Re the Backtest overfitting: Last week we added the [Deflated](https://mlfinlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/implementations/backtest_statistics.html#deflated-sharpe-ratio) and [Probabilistic](https://mlfinlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/implementations/backtest_statistics.html#probabilistic-sharpe-ratio) Sharpe ratios, [Campbell's](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/research/blob/campbell/Backtesting/Backtesting.ipynb) famous Haircut Sharpe Ratio and Profit Hurdle algorithms will be released in the coming week.

datascience,"In my sort of work/project, I was tasked to classify tweets (sentiment analysis). I did the annotation step (farmed it out actually), did the inter rater thing, tried to clean it as best as I could, used a bunch of algorithms, from naive bayes to multilingual Bert to even novel algorithms, but only got an accuracy of about 80%, very little hyperparameter tuning tho (interesting to note tho is that regardless of which method I chose, they're all  quite near that accuracy range of 80%). And tbh man I'm feeling so down about it.

I sort of know why the accuracy isn't very good. Even the annotators and myself were also having some trouble during the annotation per se because there's a lot of nuance and context in the data (and a LOT of sarcasm). Like, there are some items that could really go either way.

You loose 2 GB of ram with the 2080TI's, but instead you get 8700 cuda cores, versus the Titan's 4600 cores. You also get almost double the amount of tensor cores. However, the memory interface and bandwidth is bigger for the titan, (616 GB/s vs. 672 GB/s).   
I guess if you need more than 24GB and don't want to use more that 2 cards, then Titan's could be the solution. But at the same time, for the price of 2 titans, you can get a nice quadro? Is it perhaps more a power-consumption-to-memory question?   
What am i missing, why does the RTX Titan exist?  
Thank you.

datascience,"Fellow Data Scientists, 

I'm a junior data scientist, almost two years of experience in modeling. I come from a computer engineering background. 

Here's where I stand tech/skills/toolbox: 
1. Intermediate level of coding in Python (can write decent code, some OOP tricks but not too advanced), decent in R (built two models before I switched to Python) 
2. Stats: other than what I learned in school, I know enough to get by and analyze my results. Can't go too deep in Statistical Learning
3. MLE stuff: pretty good at it, in terms of deployment, image/docker, cloud MLOps (I like this part because I'm good at it) 
4. DS Knowledge: learned lots in school, but I mostly use regression and some sort of feature reduction/importance


In the mid of a COVID crisis, and wanting to push forward either for a promotion (post-crisis) or a new job. Here are my options: 

A. Work harder on Python level skillset to reach the intermediate ++ (Publish package, practice better OOP principals, encapsulation, unit testing, etc.) [PS: this can come if I just stay at it with work because it's a skill that grows)

B. Get my stats in order (I have some pretty good resources) but it's hard for me to learn without direct application

C. Invest in Deep Learning (I'm aware that some of the MOOCs are bull-shit, Udacity's nano but some Coursera courses are pretty legit). I know just enough from school, but I wouldn't say that I can play ball. 


I'm leaning more towards option C because I feel that A and B will come with more exposure. And in the worst case I get laid off, most companies are on the deep learning end or computer vision and not the statistician masquerading as a data scientist role.

datascience,"One of the ostensible selling points of Python over R is that Python supposedly deals better with large data sets, as it doesn't store datasets in memory. However, I recently learned from this very subreddit that pandas stores datasets in memory. 

Given how frequently data scientists can need to deal with very large datasets, are there any good alternatives to pandas that doesn't do this, or ways around this, etc? Otherwise, given how essential I've always understood pandas to be to data science in Python, the language seems to lose a major advantage in its favor.

(I don't mean for this to be a Python vs R post -- personally I plan on learning both for flexibility.)",Are there good Python alternatives to pandas that don't store datasets in memory?,1585488085

datascience,"Hey all,

So brief summary, I applied for a Market Analyst position (first analyst position in general) and essentially after proving my SQL skills in a few, very tedious interviews beforehand, made it to the final interview (via video, woo!)

It was this last question in this final interview that just threw me off of everything, as I have like no statistical experience/knowledge (except for taking one stats class in early college lol). 

So I know this is probably simpler than I made it out to be in my head, but it being in the moment, and again, my lack of statistical knowledge in general, I literally was stumped. 


Essentially here’s what I was given:

Upon past email marketing survey efforts to a test send group of 10,000 customers, we had a 20% response rate. We then had a control group to 1,000 customers, and had a response rate of 15% with them. 

We want to lower the control group and yet, be confident we can measure the response rate with statistical significance. What would you recommend?


So basically, I pulled stuff out my ass with things like “further personalization of the designs of these email surveys as we decrease the control group size, as well as trigger(automate) emails to send surveys out in a more timely manner” (LOL) etc etc; knowing damn well that this problem isn’t really focused on the process or design of the survey itself.

They tried giving me a hint saying that this is supposed to be conceptual and there’s no one right answer and they don’t need exact calculations or anything but more of the statistical thought process one would go through for this experiment.


The only stats I remember was like simple t-tests (one sample and independent samples) but I’m rusty in both concepts and definitely need to go back and refresh every little thing about them. Plus, wasn’t even sure if this scenario even constitutes those two tests lol. 

I was feeling so good up until then since literally all of the other interviews and questions were about SQL and they were really impressed by my queries and such. And on top of that, they said most of the day to day is SQL so I felt like this might be my first analyst position I could finally land.

But what’s done is done and as I wait for a decision, I wanted to see what thought process you guys would’ve essentially said (in simplest terms?) so that I can learn and just be able to familiarize myself with some of these terminologies for future references.

Thanks in advance for any input on the matter~",What’s the simplest way I should’ve answered this conceptual statistics/methodology question in my interview (Market Analyst)?,1585454701
