datascience,"Hello all, quick question about Spacy NER. 

Let's say I train a Spacy model to identify brand names, and in the labeled data I am using, the word Apple is tagged as ""brand"", and Amazon is not. But I augmented this Spacy model using word vectors; would this Spacy model be able to extrapolate that Amazon is also a brand, based that Apple and Amazon are similar words, and Apple was tagged as brand in the training data (even though Amazon was never tagged in this same training data)?

I am actually working on a NER model to extract technical keywords out of a document, but there are countless keywords (including SKUs, etc.) so creating a master list of all the keywords is not feasible. If NER won't work for this problem, does anyone have any other ideas?

Finally, I've become a grown-up and recently just graduated from my university.

I come from an MSc in business intelligence and have about one year of experience with study jobs, that is mostly focused on ""front-end business intelligence"". Basically,  that means making dashboarding and working with already ready data.

So, now I just hit an interview with Amazon and I'm pretty impressed that they wanna interview with me even though I lack experience, and therefore I'm here to ask for help.

I know for sure, that this job requires a lot of technical skills within data extraction, manipulation etc for business requirements.

And.. I'm pretty sucky in SQL having only had in school and made some basic query. The interview is on Wednesday, and I don't know if I should just try it? They send an e-mail, that said they will have live coding test on me but I basically am scared because I'm terrible at this part.

What's ur suggestion? I have two days to maybe run a data camp for fundamentals of SQL, but I'm unsure if that's enough to consider myself worthy for this position?

My life is a bit topsy turvy, though I shouldn't have any regrets 'cos apart from unemployment, I'm pretty happy with my life. Some information about me first, I'm highly creative but I'm also very analytical.  

I graduated with a degree in Biology and Chemistry. Decent grades, not the best, but I didn't want to go to Medical School so I ended up studying some film courses in Hollywood. I ended up having a film career in the Philippines as a second unit director and coordinator. (basically, I work with different groups, and do all the handling of talents and set coordination) A healthy mix of creative input and logistic problem-solving. After about ten years of that (until 2018) I decided I wanted something more stable than freelance work. I moved to New York with my wife. (I'm a US Citizen) and I joined a boot camp for data science.  I got certified in December of last year. My wife has a stable job now (almost a year) and I'm still unemployed. 

I've tried applying everywhere, entry-level, and even unpaid internships.  I have a decent knowledge of data analytics, I've made some personal projects apart from the ones we had to make at the boot camp. So I'm more than qualified for an entry-level job in data analytics, I think. I've had about 2 or 3 initial interviews but that's about it.

datascience,"My background: I have a PhD in Physics, which was heavy on the data analysis &amp; Monte Carlo simulations (but in a non-OOP language few have heard of). And I've spent the last 8 years working in finance at a top-tier bank in data engineer / financial analyst combinational role. 

During lockdown I've completed [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/) (highly recommended for beginners) and I've now started planning for the future. With a mix of the professional and personal I'm considering (covid notwithstanding) taking a sabbatical next spring to travel and study. 

Initially I thought a Master's in Data Science was the best option and had settled on applying for the [MSDS at Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/master-of-applied-data-science-umich). However this would cost $42k and with my current background I think a master's might be overkill anyway. So I'm currently considering taking a year out and aiming to finish all/most of the below in lieu of a masters:  


* Two 'MicroMasters' one at [MIT](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data) (heavy on the Statistics) and [UCSanDiego](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/uc-san-diegox-data-science) (heavy on Python, ML &amp; Spark) - to be clear, I'll do both - approx 1,100 hours of study and $2,750 in total. 
* Several Coursera certificates: - 500 hours in total
   * [Michigan Applied DS](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) \- general overview ML, data mining. 
   * [IBM Applied DS](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) \- covers ML with a Capstone project
   * [IBM AI Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) \- ML, Apache Spark, Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow with a Capstone project.
   * Three different courses from deeplearning.ai, which seem to extensively cover [Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?), [TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice?) and [Natural Language](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing#courses) processing. 
* There's also a broad Specialization from [HSE](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml) on coursera, but at 240 hrs this looks similar to MicroMasters. 
* Finally, I'll probably finish the R module on Dataquest \~30 hours

The above will likely evolve as I learn more. And I'll keep an eye out for worthwhile Kaggle projects (already finished the Titanic project). 

Long-term I may wish to move away from finance entirely, maybe even back to academia. But short-term I might be best placed to attempt to pivot back to finance into a full time data science role for a few years and then decide from there. 

I'd really appreciate any advice or suggestions on anything, but especially; 1. the merits of foregoing a masters over the above. 2. comments on the future plans, 3. Kaggle suggestions, 4.

datascience,"Data scientist?  What does that mean?  I know many struggle with this question.  Let me try to provide some clarity and thoughts by comparing to other professions.  In this world there are many big industries oil, energy, auto, pharmaceutical, aero, shipping, finance, etc.   just to name a few.   Many other newer businesses too but many new ones are built on marketing like FB.   Each specific company has different data infrastructure, business needs, and problems to solve.    Each company has to make profits.  If they are collecting or trying to collect data then they want to use it to optimize/estimate/predict and make more profits.  Data scientists build capability or products to do this.  

Now we can ask the questions of who is qualified for this work and how much is a data scientist job title worth?
Well what is a financial analyst worth,  what is an engineer worth?   Who can do those jobs?   It all depends on the business.    For these other professions they require accredited schools and some require standard certifications like PE license.  So the qualifications depend on the job and business.  Also,  just because one is experienced in one business doesn’t mean they make big bucks, because their industry may be in a bad time in history.   Many professional engineers in oil industry are cut or making less today.   In finance I am sure big bankers make a whole lot more than little ones and are basically a different profession than little banks due to skill set.  But both are considered financial analysts.  One thing the other professions have learned is their domain expertise, with traditional skills.  Which usually analyzes data already in their jobs.

Data science is even more general than other professions.  I could find a high school student and train them to be a data scientist very cheaply and quickly on some dataset using powerBi.  But they won’t know much about other domains, business, profits, design, coding, and consequences of data decisions.  Most importantly they won’t have domain or business knowledge.  Which they will need to get a good data science job and provide value to business. They could probably find one with some small business trying to analyze their small datasets like at a local library or city govt.  But it won’t pay well, maybe minimum wage.  This would be just a few steps under the large amount of people today getting a BS or just a MS without a thesis.  So the low end will be getting flooded with this type of job seeker.  This is ok since everyone with data wants to profit from it.  But due to accreditation or licenses these jobs will be low pay, not like engineering. 

Now many wonder how do I just get the highest paid job with the smallest amount of education in data science?  This question appears here almost multiple times a day.   The answer is hard,  one can do it with just a no thesis MS but it may not pay well.  It is a continuum, where depending on what you know, and who you know you will be qualified for various roles.  If you have a phd, highly technical, understand business problems, and have personal connections you can work at Google.  If not then it will be more difficult.  

Data science won’t go away but expand vastly.  It will not be taken over by analysts and software engineering but the opposite in prototyping phases.  The pay and people in the field would also expand, making many lower and higher paid jobs.   It will not be a clear distribution of pay, but multimodal,  and average pay will not mean anything.  Many modes of pay.  

So in take away, if you want the best and highest paid job as a “data scientist”,  You need higher education, correct technical skills for a company, understand a company/industry, and know people.   There is no easy route and as always the only path to greatness is putting in the work for years, and networking.

datascience,"Quick background: I graduated with my MS in data science in January 2019. I decided to pursue a PhD because I noticed that all the jobs I wanted either required or strongly encouraged a PhD. I'm 1.5 years into a PhD in computer science, which includes statistics and natural language processing. My masters thesis was in time series. Before that, I was working as an analyst without programming skills. During my masters, I did two data analyst/data science internships.


I've been trying to find a remote, part-time internship for a while now to keep my industry skills sharp and never even got to the interview stage since starting my PhD. I figured with my experience, I was perfect for an internship: I have academic experience, I have a little bit of industry experience, but I really need mentorship and guidance when dealing with practical problems.


Last week, one company emailed me back but told me that they were offering the paid internship that I'd applied to as unpaid only, and they asked me if I was interested in an interview. I figured why not, at the least it would be good interview practice. 


Horrific is maybe an exaggeration, but it was truly awful. So first of all, the company deals with image classification, which I've never done outside of classes. Maybe I was naive, but I thought that a few classes I took two years ago and my more recent experience in natural language processing might be enough to translate into an internship in image classification. I was wrong. 


I didn't realize it was going to be a technical interview. They immediately started off by asking me if I knew a certain term and to explain it. I had never even heard of it, so I'm not sure if it was a library, a concept, or a software (yes, I should have written it down but at this point, I was very flustered). This continued for maybe ten different terms. With each one, I'd never heard of it. I wish I had just cut the interview short after the first two or three since it was such an obvious mismatch. They eventually gave up and just asked me to explain what I was currently working on, and the interview ended.


I don't know where to go from here. Clearly there is a huge discrepancy between my skills and the skills that this company was expecting from someone with an undergrad or masters degree in data science/machine learning. Normally, I would find a bootcamp or some course and start up from scratch again. But I'm wondering if it would be better to focus on what I'm doing in my PhD and try to hone one or two skills. I am scared of either (a) pigeon-holing myself and not being able to find a job in those specific areas or (b) broadening my skills to the point that I don't actually know anything important about a wide variety of data science concepts.


By getting a PhD, did I ruin my chances of working in anything other than what I'm working on now?

I'm currenly trying to use the orange data mining tool via both supervised and unsupervised learning - to study past historical sales trend and product images, and project future trends using more images.

In the industry i'm in, this sounds like it would work well as we have a large dataset (40k images and 5-8 years x 4 quarters of sales trend) to work from.

However, i'm having difficulties integrating images into the workflow because of the type of data image embedding returns (999 numerical values etc.) - anyone can point me in the right direction on how to make this work?

In my country, Singapore, more efforts and investment are initiated from the government to push data analytics and AI to be implemented in business and is one of the driver of the national economic plans. I'm new to the community and will like to ask the people here about career advice here in data science/AI. 

Academics:
Masters in Information System
I will finished my Masters in Information System from National University of Singapore this December, which is a #10 University Ranking Globally - QS World University Rankings by Subject 2019. 
I took four data science related courses mainly related to machine learning and predictive analytics.
-big data technologies(hadoop &amp; spark)
-predictive analytics (machine learning)
-intelligent system (more qualitative)
-data mining

Economics Undergraduate degree
Prior, I had an economics major background and graduated with the highest honour. 

Job:
Transaction Banking Product management experience - 1 year. My first job as a trainee for a year in a international bank. 
Data analyst, currently I have also secured a role in another leading international bank as a data analyst that uses predictive analytics and ML (not yet started)

My ultimate aim is to be a data scientist that uses AI or maybe an AI role but less on being a developer part. I'm not so much interested about business intelligence too. In the long term, I will like to grow into a even more rewarding career in the future. I dont have a preference in industry, but given my work experience and internships, I thought its more efficient to pursue something in the financial industry.

I was thinking doing another masters degree in Georgia Tech Online Masters of Science in Analytics (OMSA) program as part-time to further deepen my skills and be exposed to new ideas on how people apply analytics.(will it help in my career?). If relevant, I am 27-29 years old. I thought a degree with the brand name from georgia tech, can expose me to new career opportunities overseas.

datascience,"I'm a 24 y/o Supply Chain Analyst at an Aerospace manufacturer with only a business management degree. I am technically savvy and know how to query our database, and export and analyze our data in Excel only. Recently, after doing a deep Safety Stock analysis, it started to occur to me how much potential there was for advanced analyses if I knew more coding languages/programs and mathematical concepts. Currently I perform most of my analyses with existing supply-chain-type equations, or just basic logic, but I almost feel like I'm cheating my job a bit without knowing more technical knowledge. Not to sell myself short, I am revered at my company as a young (24 yo) prodigy for knowing advanced Excel (lol), however I feel there is so much more I could be doing. 

Therefore, I'd like to explore the Data Science/Statistics field to learn more mathematical and programming concepts. To preface, I am an ambitious person, and love to learn. I've begun online (Udemy) classes for Python and SQL, and eventually more.. (I doubt that will be enough) but my main concern is with the math portion of Data Science. Looking back at my business degree, everything is theoretical to the point that I laugh thinking of how someone can learn practical business concepts from school. I've been working for 2 years in the Aerospace industry, and ""Business Management"" is load of shit in my opinion. There is no result, no practice, no product that you can market to an employer (IMO you'd be better off with a marketing or finance degree, something tangible so you can create a portfolio). I of course know there is exception, and I do value the discipline, endurance, and overview I received. But I feel like business education is much different than technical education like data science/statistics. Is data science/statistics something you can learn as you go? I feel like math is math, regardless of where you learn it, but the practice of where to apply certain theories is the important aspect to know? 

Just to tie this up, as I continue to work at my job, I'll be practicing programming, doing projects and even ""take work home"" and try to solve work problems/opportunities at home with a more diverse set of tools (Python, etc.). As I do this I imagine I'll run into mathematical concepts and problems that I will research and understand, and then move on with that knowledge. But I fear doing it that way will be putting together the Legos without reading the instructions, if that makes sense. I'm a little averse to more schooling because of the wealth of knowledge that exists on the internet/books/etc, but I would be open to night classes alongside my current job. (I'm an avid Dave Ramsey follower if that makes sense to you)

I am debating whether or not to continue with my PhD because I am not sure if the academic researcher life is right for me, and so I am thinking of leaving with my masters degree and moving back to my hometown and getting a job in industry while my wife finishes her bachelors degree. 

I have searched online for companies in my hometown that are hiring people with my background, and most of the jobs that seem like they might be interested in someone with my degree are data analysis positions that ask for people with “masters degrees in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or similar disciplines.” Correct me if I’m wrong but I think physics fits here.

It wasn't about how to build one (such as the technical part), but instead, it was focused entirely on the UX. I put it on my bookmarks and of course, it got lost after a while. I am looking now for such resources, preferable a MOOC. Do you have any?",Looking for a MOOC about UX design in Dashboards,1598179881

datascience,"I am a software engineer and I am interested in working as a data scientist/analyst(Even if its for a short time). I am especially interested in a facebook data scientist role.

I am practicing my sql and I think I will look for a statistics crash course. What other resources should I use to prepare for an interview?",What are the best resources to prepare for a data science interview?,1598167359
datascience,"So, I’m currently studying an undergrad in Data Science (DS). This course has coding, stats and a bit of econometrics. There is also a CS/Stats degree I can move to. 

The CS/Stats degree has all the stats classes with DS apart from Bayesian inference. It has software engi + regular CS stuff but no machine learning &amp; AI which is offered with DS. And obviously no eco with CS/stats. 

1.) Is it worth to switch?
2.) Is having a degree in DS too specific meaning I may be disadvantaged in other fields such as software engineering?",CS/Stats vs DataSci,1598166491
datascience,"I'm analysing billing data at work to look for anomalies (e.g. overcharging) in time series data. The models we've used so far include basic confidence intervals, time series forecasts, regression forecasts, LSTM, and libraries like [PYOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod) and [Alibi Detect](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/alibi-detect/en/v0.2.0/index.html).
