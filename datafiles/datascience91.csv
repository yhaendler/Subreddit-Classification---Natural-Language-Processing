datascience,"Hi, I’m sorry for this post but I’m just trying to understand what I’m supposed to be and do.
Do you have a minute to help me out what kind of job I’m supposed to be looking for? What position I should be looking for? I would really appreciate it, because I’m getting desperate during my job search.
I apologize in advance for some broken english here and there.

I have a bachelor in Economics during which I discovered statistics and R, and a MSc in Data Analytics.
In my MSc I studied more statistics (distributions, exponential families...), some marketing, some SQL, but mostly ML stuff (all the topics in ISLR basically) on R and Python, plus a course on NN (how they work relatively in detail, and tried them out on Python) I did go into some details on how these algorithms work, but not too much (e.g. I can’t tell you why the logistic regression doesn’t work when data is perfectly separable, but I do know the logic behind k-means, or GAMs, or SVMs, or gradient boosting, even though I think I would have a somewhat hard time with the maths involved).

I feel like I’ve done a bit of everything, but I’m not worth hiring for anything.

I’ve looked at “Data Analyst” positions, but the vast majority are focused on Excel (macros, pivot, lookup) and PowerBI. Some others simply require SQL. I’m not even good at Excel, and my SQL knowledge is basic. Machine learning is not even mentioned.

“Data Scientist” positions are more interesting, but they usually ask for more knowledge and in any case I know for sure I can’t call myself a DS, I lack the deep knowledge of maths and algorithms.

In any case, very few return my applications, very, very few.

I feel like I’ve studied to become a DS, I love what ML is, and I find the algorithms extremely fascinating, but I definitely lack the “solid ground” that someone with a BSc in Statistics or many other maths degrees, has over me.

Am I just wrong? Is this a feeling that I have but it’s not how it works? Should I apply for positions that don’t offer any ML and just get good at Excel, PowerBI, Tableau, and SQL? Is this the correct career path?

I’m really doubting my choices. I entered this field without knowing it and properly gathering information on how it works, I just found it fascinating and it agreed with my natural behavior of looking for patterns and striving to understand why and how things work. I also feel like my MSc is worth nothing, as I can’t apply for a job that actively does all that ML, as I would need much more knowledge. Instead, I’m starting to think that I should have had much more SQL courses.

I don’t know, I’m just so lost. If you have some time to look at this rant and find some information to give me I would greatly appreciate it. Or simply tell me where to look for this kind of information.

[NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) is a toolkit for building new State-of-the-Art Conversational AI models. NeMo has separate collections for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) models. Each collection consists of prebuilt modules that include everything needed to train on your data. Every module can easily be customized, extended, and composed to create new Conversational AI model architectures.

Conversational AI architectures are typically large and require a lot of data and compute for training. NeMo uses PyTorch Lightning for easy and performant multi-GPU/multi-node mixed-precision training.

[Cool collab notebook for getting started with NeMo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/r1.0.0rc1/tutorials/NeMo_Getting_Started.ipynb) shows how we can construct a toy demo showing the ability to translate Russian audio files into English. That's what is so neat about NeMo is the pipeline is so diverse; we can translate these audio files into English, then if we wanted to, use BERT for the NLP task for the translated English as well. And so on and so on.

Completed my undergrad in data analytics and I'm now considering an online master's in applied statistics. Initially, I was looking over any data analytics or data science programs but I feel like I will learn more skills that I can retain in my career long term with more emphasis on statistics. I know programming is very important and I have some basic knowledge of Python and SQL and I figure I can learn more tools on my own.

So my employer covers up to $5250 per year and I'm trying to avoid building up any debt and therefore I narrowed my search to these two programs that are below 30k.

I'm just about to r/iwantout once I finish my bond of service to my Singapore university and I'm looking to get back into what I always wanted to do: public policy and data science. 

There is an abundance of very expensive, very nice MPPDS (and other funny names) in the West, mostly looking at CMU, GT, USC etc. but I'm not too interested in names or prestige as compared to finding a course with a strong Asia focus. I'd rather study where I intend to work afterwards (excluding Singapore as the public policy schools are more mid 30s clubhouse simulators) but I really cannot find anywhere with a solid DS foundation and a public policy focus in the region. 

Potentally looking at CMU Adelaide, perhaps Australia but wanted to know if I'm missing something. Asia loves MBAs and other Master's which are not interesting to me. Alternatively, are there any good schools abroad with a fair Asia focus? I'm definitely returning after my studies to the Asia region, though I'd honestly be willing to go anywhere if it fits.

datascience,"I want to (commiserate) hear about your terrible interview experiences. Here’s mine that happened a few weeks ago:

I saw a job posting for one of my most watched companies and it was for a job that was an exact mirror of my resume. I had work experience, academic research, and personal projects done in the exact area (and oddly specific tech stack I had worked in). I applied on Day X, they emailed me on Day X+1 to set up an interview for Day X+2. 

I was scheduled for a 45 minute phone call to go over the usuals + some technical stuff. The interviewer called and started off the conversation by saying how they contacted me as soon as they read my resume. On the first “tell me about yourself” kind of question I stuttered really bad (I have a usually mild speech impediment but it is worse over the phone) and the interviewer’s tone immediately changed. I didn’t think this was going to be a problem because I briefly mentioned this in one of my emails giving them advanced notice. The interviewer basically was like “if you don’t have anything else for me I think that’s fine.” and ended the call after 4 MINUTES. It was a 4 minute phone call that was supposed to be 45.

I received the rejection email a little later.

Just very disappointed as this was a company I had built up in my mind and a place where I really could have added value. I will be okay as there are lots of other opportunities for me, but I was just very upset following this. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience or any advice to offer up?

datascience,"I'm a 21 year old senior graduating in a couple of months, and feel like I'm beyond saving. Started college with a communications degree my first two years because I was not sure of what I wanted to do, then switched to pursue a BS in Data Analytics at the start of my Junior year.

The first semester and a half of my degree was fine. I was introduced to Python, SQL, and a bunch of concepts in the field. Pandemic hits and we switch to a terrible remote learning model. Our professors were already hit or miss, but this just made things much worse second semester. I managed to get an internship as a Junior Data Analyst in the summer following Junior year, but very little to no coding was done. I was basically handed task and told to create infographics while cleaning data from huge excel sheets I was given. Around this time my father died, and my focus around the internship dwindled as I had to take some time away. 

Fast-forward a bit to the beginning of Senior year and everything is still remote. Classes still were not organized well, professors were terrible, and I was not learning anything. Just kind of did the work for grades and moved on. I spoke to other students in my field and they agreed that they felt as if they met no requirements to begin work. 

I chalked it up to bad timing in being a student during the pandemic, and turned my attention to grad school. I go to school in New York and my school offers a Data Science Masters degree, so I thought I'd do that as it's still a field of interest. After doing some research in my school's Data Science MS degree, I realized how fucked I am. Not only are the professors bottom of the barrell based on student reviews, but the prerequisites are some things I haven't touched since last being in person or before that. I am familiar with a ton of different terms within my area of study, but can by no means give you a proper run down on them. At this point I should be super comfortable in my understanding with some elements of probability and statistics, but I'm just not. I should have all the fundamental knowledge of Python and SQL, but I just don't. In fact, I can't even put it on my resume anymore because I essentially forgot everything. 

I've been going on too long and am losing focus of the initial purpose of this post, sorry. What do you think my options are? I have close to a 4.0 GPA in my major, 3.5 GPA overall, but it's not reflective of the information I currently hold. I want to try and transfer to another program since the professors here are universally described as below average, but I feel like there are other areas of concern I need to address first such as having a plan. My initial goal was to work with a sports franchise in some facet by working with data, but I'm a complete and utter joke to the job market right now; and I'm scared if I enter Grad school I'll get punched in the face.

Many of the data sources I use are estimates. For intercensal population from the Census Bureau as one example, when a new version comes out the source will update the prior year's estimates using the new data. In v2020 population for Springfield in year 2015 could be 1,000. But then in v2021 population for Springfield 2015 might be 1,005. In some cases the changes are so extreme using older data is just not possible. However, most of the time it's minor enough not to change takeaways but rather just to make the results a little different. This is the case with a good number of the sources I use.

I feel bound to use the freshest data possible. The non-technical folks hate this. It means prior materials no longer jibe with new ones and they have to explain it to clients. So I always get pushback on it. There have been a few situations where I simply couldn't convince my boss and had to use prior estimates.

datascience,"I've been doing some text analytics work, and am trying out LDA (Latent Direchlet Analysis) as a way of categorizing text into different topics.  I've used it for two sets of survey data, one from local post offices, and one from medical education, and some police report data. Before getting into real data, I ran through some online exercises in R and Python, for sorting chapters of classic books.  (You know, where you get ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", and ""Nemo"", ""Submarine"", and so forth pop out, and ""Pride and Prejudice"", where ""Elizabeth"", and ""Proposal"" pop out, and so on.)

I'm unwhelmed by the results.   For the data sets I'd done topic modeling on by hand, and have a fair amount of domain knowledge.   I've played with varying parameters, but had a fairly clear idea going in what a 'reasonable' number of categories would be.

The category clusters use common words, but I can't think what the clusters are supposed to represent, even when I go back and look at the quotes that best match those categories.   For example, with the post office one, you'd think ""Damaged stuff"", ""Late Mail"",  ""Missing Items"", or ""Like my Mail Guy"" would come out, but I can't go from the word clusters suggested by LDA to any of these obvious categories.  In the medical stuff, one concept that gets mentioned a lot is ""Broken Arm Syndrome"", and I find that ""Broken"" and ""Arm"" appear in different clusters.  (There's nothing else in this data set related to ""Broken"" or ""Arm"" separately).

I'm wondering if text size is the problem.  While the corpus size is at least 10k's of words, and \~1M in some sets, the individual quotes are almost all &lt;100 words, with some only a few.  Could that be the problem?   Those of you who have some experiences with real data sets and LDA, could you confirm or deny whether you've been successful.
