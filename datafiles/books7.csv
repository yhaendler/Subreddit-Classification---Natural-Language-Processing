I typically read a paragraph then my mind is like ‚Äúwtf did you just read‚Äù  so I reread, which slows me down.

I was recently hosting a panel at a literature festival with three other respected, very talented authors. We were talking about what books we'd commend to each other if the world ended. And it emerged that I had never read Black Beauty by Anna Sewell.

The writer was very passionate and very convincing. She couldn't believe that I had somehow gone 33 years without reading it. So I decided to give it a go.

And in short, very, very enjoyable. A great story and so beautifully written. I am, of course, encouraging everyone to pick it up, for the first time or again.

For instance, this past summer I started the gentleman bastards, I read the lies of Locke Lamora. Then I decided I wanted to read kingkiller Chronicles. So I read the name of the wind and about halfway though the wise man's fear, found myself a bit burnt out on the story. But I finished anyways. And then I went back to gentleman bastards and I found myself unable to get back into it the way I was before.

But I think that may have had to do with the series I was reading, and not so much me. I'm halfway through book 2 of the stormlight archive and am having no issues with being burnt out. So maybe it was just the book I was reading at the time.

Second , I didn't search for similar questions because I almost spoiled Never let me go in the process of finding movie v/s book reviews . I know very well how stupid it is to even consider a adaptation over the original,especially for a writer as good as Ishiguro (although I've heard that The remains of the day movie is pretty good. ). The thing is, I prefer the visual medium in the general case - for instance I can take a movie or tv show over the (written) source material  if(and only if ) it is as emotionally impactful as the source material - a movie can't show a character's inner monologues or show the story through a character's perspective as well as a book - but as i read in a 'The remains of the day'  review :"" an adaptation can be a masterpiece in it's own way""  - by using the advantages the visual medium has over written text.  

So enough prevarication. My question : should I watch the movie first or read the books first  ? I would  prefer the better experience first. Again ,I prefer the visual medium and can overlook its flaws - but in this case (and especially in this case , as Ishiguro got a freaking Nobel Prize in literature for the ""great emotional force"" his novels carried.)

I'm torn. On one hand, I get it-- Jeanine Cummins was given a million dollar book deal to write a book about the Mexican migrant experience, whereas actual Mexican and Mexican-American authors don't get these kinds of deals, or even any recognition that might lead to these kinds of book deals. Based on a handful of reviews I read, it also seems like the depiction of the migrants and their lives is pretty poorly done in her book: at best a naive outsider's view of their situation, at worst a mish-mash of stereotypes and cliches.

On the other hand, I'm definitely concerned about the precedent that this (and others like it) sets, that no one can write a book outside of their own culture/experience, or that you don't have the right to write about another culture. I would say one of the most important aspects of literature, maybe *the* most important aspect, is that authors have the freedom to create any world they want, to write about anything they want. And if the book is terrible, or the characters or world the author created aren't believable, then the book will fail because it's not good.

I'm wondering if the solution here isn't gatekeeping who gets to create what art and using the concept of cultural appropriation to limit what people can do, but instead lifting up authors and artists who are currently unheralded or recognized. It seems like ultimately the issue isn't that white authors/artists have an easier time making a name for themselves, but rather that non-white authors/artists have a much more difficult road to travel. So maybe instead of saying Jeanine Cummins can't write about migrants, people should spend time promoting authors from Mexico or elsewhere that are doing amazing work but not getting a shot, and putting pressure on publishing houses to support the work of people who are being overlooked?",American Dirt and writing books about other cultures,1580398108
