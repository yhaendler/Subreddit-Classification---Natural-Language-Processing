datascience,"I really enjoy playing with numbers. Since, I was a kid I enjoyed doing weird stuff with numbers. Now I am in my Bachelors and learning a lot of stuff. The thing is, I still enjoy analysing numbers (data), gathering relevant information and producing it into answers about some questions. However, I hate programming. I am just terrified of it. I can understand what someone is doing by looking at the code but I can't write it myself. Now I am at a position where I feel I need to learn programming to analyse data which makes it a liability for me. My love to analyze data gets diminished by my fear of not able to program and this makes me very anxious and sad at the same time concerning my future. I was wondering if there exists career opportunities where we have the chance to analyse data but not programme which also pays decently. Another side note, I love working on social projects such as human trafficking, plastic pollution because of its complexity and inter-dynamics of various fields in it.

I'm building a small side project on the analysis of the sentiment of public companies' shares and I want to expose my thought process so that you can criticize it and suggest possible improvements.

The idea of the project is to practice several skills to improve my daily job (I work for a data startup in Italy)

The idea for the project is: 

- fetch news headlines on a dailybasis with a scheduled Python job, with https://newsapi.org/ (example : $AAPL stock related headlines)

- preprocess them with Python and SKlearn, applying the ""pipeline"" practices, to clean and preprocess the data

- build a NoSQL database with all the processed data (I can fetch only since last month with the APIs, so with time I want to build my local headlines history

- for the DB I was thinking about MongoDB or ElasticSearch, some suggestions here? 

- analyze sentiment of the headlines, and save them in the DB 

- after this collection-cleaning-analysis process, I will use Dash https://plotly.com/dash/ to build an interactive dashboard with the results (then host the dashboard with Heroku)

‚Äã

Better MongoDB or Elastic for my use case? I don't think I really need the Elastic scalability, but I've seen some cool features that MongoDB doesn't have.

datascience,"Hi,

I am an aspiring data scientist (who DOES NOT have a question about entering the field), seeking to understand the field‚Äôs relation to its own composite fields, and about the subfields of data science.

As I understand it, data science is a composite field at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and statistics. That said, while the field is new, much of what falls under it is not, with research into what would now be considered ‚Äúdata science‚Äù dating back a good bit, in multiple fields.

Equally, while I understand that given the field‚Äôs young age, much of the terminology associated with it is still being codified, I‚Äôve been told by my professors that the field has two ends, data analytics vs artificial intelligence. First of all, is this generally accepted?

Of the two, AI interests me much more, and it is the focus of my further question‚Äîthere is a long history of research in AI in its own right by fellows like Minsky and so on, and even Chomsky, with that research seemingly being merely regarded as a subfield of computer science (witness how the IEEE has acknowledged advances in the field; I‚Äôve also taken an AI class in a CS department.)

I am frankly, very unclear on the extent to which this work relates to AI as a subfield of data science. Is it mostly the same, is there overlap, or, is it mostly irrelevant to data science (just a term in common)? I feel certain that most questions of cognitive science, for instance, are irrelevant to data science‚Äîwe aren‚Äôt trying to build Hal from 2001‚Äìbut I have no clear sense of this generally.

Bonus question: where and how does data mining relate to data science as a whole?

shows Godels 1st and 2nd theorems shown to end in meaninglessness

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/GODEL5.pdf

Godels 1st theorem

‚ÄúAny effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete. In particular, for any consistent, effectively generated formal theorythat proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is true,[1] but not provable in the theory (Kleene 1967, p. 250)

but Godel cant tell us what makes a mathematical statement true,

thus his theorem is meaningless

even Cambridge expert on Godel Peter Smith admits

""G√∂del didn't rely on the notion of truth""

thus by not telling us what makes a maths statement true Godels 1st theorem is meaningless

so  much for separating truth from proof

and for some relish

Godel uses his G statement to prove his theorem but Godels sentence G is outlawed by the very axiom of the system he uses to prove his theorem ie the axiom of reducibility -thus his proof is invalid,

Godels 2nd theorem

Godels second theorem ends in paradox‚Äì impredicative

The theorem in a rephrasing reads http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#Proof_sketch_for_the_second_theorem

The following rephrasing of the second theorem is even more unsettling to the foundations of mathematics: If an axiomatic system can be proven to be consistent and complete from within itself, then it is inconsistent.‚Äù

or again

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems

""The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.""

But here is a contradiction Godel must prove that a system c a n n o t b e proven to be consistent based upon the premise that the logic he uses must be consistent . If the logic he uses is not consistent then he cannot make a proof that is consistent. So he must assume that his logic is consistent so he can make a proof of the impossibility of proving a system to be consistent. But if his proof is true then he has proved that the logic he uses to make the proof must be consistent, but his proof proves that this cannot be done

note if Godels system is inconsistent then it can demonstrate its consistency and inconsistency

but Godels theorem does not say that

it says

""...the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency""

thus as said above

""But here is a contradiction Godel must prove that a system c a n n o t b e proven to be consistent based upon the premise that the logic he uses must be consistent""

But if his proof is true then he has proved that the logic he uses to make the proof must be consistent, but his proof proves that this cannot be done","For science: Godels theorem: ""Kurt G√∂del‚ÄîSeparating Truth from Proof in Mathematics""",1600812252
datascience,"Hey all,

I have a bachelor's degree in Statistics and 3+ years of experience working with advanced analytics and data science. 

I recently move to the US, and I feel that people care a lot about Masters here. However, I do not know what kind of Master I should pursue.

**if I go for MS in Statistics**

* drawback: not sure if I will learn many new things, especially the ones important for working with data science, such as programming skills and artificial intelligence techniques. In addition, my undergrad program had already offered me a strong background in Statistics
* positive point: it is a more traditional field, and it has a solid technical reputation in the market (for many years).

**If I go for MS in Data Science**

* drawback: many of the programs are new. some of them have the fame of just taking advantage of data science as a market trend - only looking for students' money, not teaching anything real
* positive point: I feel that I might learn more useful things for a real data science job - but it is definitely more a feeling than a certainty.

datascience,"Hi, I'm a college senior and am majoring in CS and Math. I've been really struggling trying to figure out what I should do after I graduate. I know I want to get into a Machine Learning PhD program but I don't know how I would go about doing this.

I've taken classes in linear algebra, probability theory, statistics, diff. eqs., intro A.I., etc., and am currently taking machine learning and deep learning. I also have pretty good grades (I think). The problem is I have ***no research experience.*** I've done projects relating to machine learning, and will probably do more considering the classes I'm in, but no papers.

It's a little to late for me to do research with a professor since I skipped a year (graduating in 3 years rather than 4) and given the current situation its hard to find any research opportunities while being remote.

So, in my na√Øve and inexperienced view, I see 2 paths:

1. Go to grad school for a machine learning MS, and hopefully get some research experience while I'm there. I looked into this recently and apparently if your ultimate goal is a PhD this doesn't seem to be the best move, especially if you already have a CS/ML background and aren't pivoting form a related area. That and I looked up the tuition cost of the top MS programs in ML (CMU, Berkley, etc.) and holy s\*\*t they are absurdly expensive!
2. Then there's option 2, getting some research experience with an ML internship. This seems to be a better choice since I wouldn't be breaking the bank (and in fact getting paid), it'd be research focused rather than course focused etc. And, maybe, I'll have a leg up since I had an internship at a big software company last summer.

The problem is, do those research internship positions even exist? It seems most of the positions I find are for MS and PhD students. This makes sense of course, why would you want a kid fresh out of college to work on your research rather than an MS/PhD student. But still, I'm totally unclear on what I should do. I can't find any info online about what people in my position do usually.

1. Do they just suck it up and get a masters? 
2. Do they just always have research experience and so don't deal with this?
3. And even if I find a research position it might only be for the summer. In that case I would have to find another one for the year I'm no longer in school yet also not in a PhD program (or maybe just a regular software dev job I guess).
