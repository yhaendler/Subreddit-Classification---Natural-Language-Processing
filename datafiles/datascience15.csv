datascience,"Hello,

So I am a recent university graduate with a bachelor's degree with a focus on data science. My time in college was not perfect the first few years due to some health issues so I had a 2.0 GPA as a CompSci major, but in my last 4 semesters, I averaged a 3.8 GPA. Due to the bad start and since I was paying some costs out of pocket, I had to take various jobs and took classes during the summer. So I have no internship experience. Back then, I wanted to graduate quickly and then I would search for internships after I graduated. However, now I find myself in a tough financial situation where I need to find work within the next couple of months. I have applied to hundreds of postings but I have only managed to get a handful of interviews. Most of the criticism I receive is that I have no working experience. How can I get experience if I am rejected at every turn? Any advice on this issue?

datascience,"Hello,

I am trying to come up with a fair way to measure two groups of different sizes progressing towards the same goal.  
I have Group1 with 1000 members and Group2 with 200 members. Each member has to complete a survey that will be open for 20 days. Obviously, group2 has fewer members and reaching 100% participation will take less time than group2.   
I was thinking of measuring the pace of the progress towards 100% participation rather than the actual time it takes to hit 100%. For Example: the projected pace for Group1 is 50 members/day (1000 members/20 days), while the projected pace for group2 is 10 members per day.  Who is more successful will then be determined by the actual average daily pace (number of members completing survey) as a percentage of the group's target pace. If group1 finishes in 19 days, their actual average daily pace will be 52.5 or 105% of their projected pace.   
Does this seem like a fair way to measure which group is on-track? Is there another way to ""handicap"" group2?  
I am open to consider other approaches as well.",How to measure progress towards a goal for groups with different number of members?,1583788126

I have a dataset of companies, and I know for each company what percentage of their revenue came from which region. (e.g: company A has total revenue 100K, 40K in USA, 60K in europe. Company B has 1 million revenue, 900K in USA, 100K in europe, etc..).

However, a logistic regression will probably just tell me that increasing USA revenue % and Europe revenue % increases likelihood of being succesful (because it increases revenue).

datascience,"In complex projects, especially in research, there can be many notebooks (Jupyter or otherwise) used for data cleaning, munging, feature engineering and analysis.

Some of you may be in the position of having a dedicated person employed for data cleaning and other boring stuff, but for many, especially PhD students these kinds of activities is bread and butter and take much more time than the actual model development - especially when integrating complex data from multiple sources.

Onto the question - for those of you who work with (Jupyter) notebooks, how do you move the data around, keeping it tidy and reproducible?

datascience,"Hi all - little background about me:  
I already work as a data scientist for a big consulting firm. My skills in stats and programming are enough to get me by, and I have little interest in continuing my study of theoretical statistics or computer science.

That said, I know it will help my career if I get an advanced degree, so I've been looking into masters of applied data science programs (part-time, preferably, maybe online). Problem is, I haven't got a clue where to start.

I learn by doing. Case studies were the highlight of my undergrad - small teams are presented with a business case and relevant data, design a strategic response, and then discuss the benefits and detriments of the various solutions the class came up with. In my career as a consultant I do effectively the same thing. 

Therefore, that's how I want my higher education to be structured - teaching specific concepts, methodologies, or algorithms through end-to-end case study type problems (with the learning expedited through competent case study design, guidance from the educators, and class discussion).

An example case study could go like (just spitballing):

1. You are given an information packet which details a problem your client is facing (to simulate the SOW you'd see in consulting, ie after basic discovery has been done)
   1. You have to read it to learn the business has many contracts with many vendors 
   2. You'd also learn they are looking to reduce the overhead they spend on writing and enforcing those contracts by standardizing the contract language
2. You are given links to a lot of data
   1. Some object store holds all of the contracts, which are scanned-image PDFs in some object store
   2. There's a database which contains hours charged to ""legal - sales"" during the negotiation of those contracts and hours charged to ""legal - disputes"" during contract disputes, which can be correlated by vendor and time frame
   3. There's another database which contains accounting numbers for ""goodwill"" write-offs related to contract disputes
   4. There is additional useless data in all of these sources which must be weeded out
3. You need to design and build a solution
   1. First you'd want to digitize the contracts:
      1. Preprocessing including computer vision such as removing noise, dealing with pages that aren't level/right-side-up, and so forth
      2. OCR by building and training a neural net 
      3. Postprocessing including NLP techniques to clean up the output 
   2. Then maybe you'd want to group similar contract clause language by clustering so minor differences are ignored 
   3. Then you'd want to query and correlate the relevant additional data in a way that creates a ""score"" for each contract clause
   4. Then you'd need to train and test an algorithm to try to predict net loss of certain contract clauses to find out if there's any statistically significant way to rank them
4. Finally you need to present the results

Does that make sense? In such a case study, you'd practice:

* querying structured data
* working with unstructured data
* OCR/neural nets
* NLP
* clustering
* feature engineering
* prediction
* statistical analysis
* presentation including visualization
* ?

Little bit here, little bit there, and after 2 years of doing that I think I'd really understand applied data science.

Does anyone know of accredited data science degree programs structured in a similar way? Am I overthinking things? Are there other considerations I may be missing?

datascience,"I am personally a fan of the [STAR format](https://www.zipjob.com/blog/star-method-resume/) for interviews or for my resume. 

For example, instead of saying something like: 

&gt;I built an anomaly detection model using isolation forests to identify click fraud, thus saving $100M a year

I would frame it using the STAR approach:

&gt;Click-Fraud Detection: Online ad platforms earn revenue when users click on an affiliated ad placed in a website, sharing part of the revenue with the website owner. Fraudulent users try to subvert this model, by building automated programs that mimic a genuine click from a genuine user.  
&gt;  
&gt;I worked with a major Australian ad platform in developing a click-fraud detection model. I used an Isolation Forest model, leveraging features like click-velocity of user, time-of-day, User's IP etc, in order to identify a fraudulent user before they have caused too much damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;The model achieved a positive predictive value of 70%, resulting in savings of $100M a year.

My questions:

1. Is this too verbose a format? Some of my reasons for this format:
   1. It's easy to wrongly assume people are familiar with the problem or even the industry. In the above example, exposition about what click-fraud is seems unnecessary. That is a toy example chosen for ease of understanding. Some industries, like Finance or Healthcare, have some very dense jargon which will never make sense to someone not intimately familiar with the industry.
   2. An ML project involves a lot of steps. This lets me flesh out a very high level summary of what happened. For instance, reading what I have written, it's easy to understand what the data sort-of looked like due to the examples of the features.
2. How do I manage content overload?
   1. Due to a large number of projects, the 2 pages now look extremely wordy.
   2. I have little hope that a recruiter would take the 5 minutes necessary to read and understand my experience. Due to the verbose format, ""ML jargon-density"" is very low. My fear is that the recruiter would eye-ball the 2 pages, see very few ""keywords"" like ""Random Forest"" or ""LSTM"" and would reject the resume.

In summary, I now face a weird choice. 

If I go ahead with the STAR format, I have a resume which is easy-to-understand (at least if it's done right), but the word count is high and there's a good chance an overworked recruiter will skim and decide against going forward. 

If I go with a more one-liner approach, the keyword-density definitely increases. This means that the skimming recruiter will catch a lot of ML-specific jargon. However, it's unlikely they would really understand what the problem was and what my solution did.

datascience,"I’ve been at my current job for about a year. My job duties look something like this: 50% Data manipulation (formatting/calculating) in SAS and MS SQL Server (sometimes I get to do ETL, but very rarely), 25% troubleshooting data anomalies (communicating with data sources), 25% building/editing Tableau dashboards. I am taking online classes on Python, and plan to take classes on R. 

I know from HR that my companies career path for my role is something like this: Associate Data Analyst —&gt; Data Analyst —&gt; Senior Data Analyst —&gt; Data Scientist etc. I’ve talked to our “Senior Data Analysts” and they don’t know any R or Python or SQL, they use SAS, SPSS, VBA and Tableau only.

We have a separate “Modeling and PA” team, and I want to make a transition to that, because that’s where the “real” data science happens, at least imo. Eventually I want to work with ML and PA myself. 

I guess my question boils down to this: besides learning R and Python (and how to use them for my purposes), as well as getting more industry knowledge, what should I do to progress my career? Should I ask for more “data sciency” projects where I can actually apply stuff I learn.

datascience,"In simplest terms, I will add a few points, just to build your interest to give it a read.

&amp;#x200B;

✔ Without an activation function, a simple #neuralnetwork is just a linear regression model. 

&amp;#x200B;

✔ We need activation functions to add complexity and non-linearity in our model equation, so that it can understand, all the complex relationships in data, create all functional mappings of inputs to outputs.

&amp;#x200B;

✔ So, we use these mathematical functions, which we know like #linear, #sigmoid, #tanh etc and are easily differentiable to perform #backpropogation #optimization strategy while propogating backwards in the network to compute gradients of Error (loss) with respect to Weights and then accordingly optimize weights using #GradientDescent.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. so, our output comes interacting with activation function.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember!

☛ Regression, use tanh , relu (use in hidden layers) and linear in output layer to get back NN outputs to continous values. 

☛ Classification ,use sigmoid/softmax in output layer.

tanh cause #VanishingGradient, it will never converge then and keep training, so use wisely.

If dead neurons, use #leakyRelu, #Maxout.
