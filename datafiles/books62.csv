books,"I‚Äôm currently reading Upheaval by Jared Diamond. I‚Äôve gotten to the chapter on Chile‚Äôs internal conflict in the 1970s. 

Basically a democratic nation elected someone they thought was in the centre but he instilled extreme Marxist policy which didn‚Äôt help the country. So in turn a capitalistic Military Coup happened which held dictatorship for 17 years. They became sadistic in their techniques of torture and terrorism. 

While the specifics are different the general trajectory and shock of the people at how fast a democracy could falter is sadly relevant. 

This quote stands out.

‚ÄúOne has to wonder how a previously democratic country could descend to such depths of behaviour, which far exceeded the previous military interventions of Chilean history in duration, number of killings, and sadism. Partly, the answer involves Chile‚Äôs increasing polarisation, violence, and breakdown of political compromise.‚Äù

I think the USA‚Äôs history of not having much education about other countries (except how it relates to the US) is a huge contribution to their current situation. 

They‚Äôve dominated western culture for an entire generation which I think may have hurt them in the long run. By blinding many to important lessons of history that come from ‚Äúsmaller countries‚Äù. 

Reading Upheaval has been an odd comfort (and learning experience) through this time.",The chapter on Chile in Jared Diamond‚Äôs Upheaval is a dire warning for the USA,1604532781

For myself, I keep a mixture of books I read as a kid and teenager and enjoyed, books on my list that want to enjoy but haven't gotten to, and just really good books that I've connected with. I try to buy only hardcover books for better preservation than paperbacks.

Just as a sampling of these categories:

\-Michael Crichton's *Eaters of the Dead*: really good book I liked as a teenager, and the style it's written in - a realistic but fictitious commentary on an old translated manuscript - was awesome. I loved reading the fictional author's commentary on the manuscript he/she was translating. As for the actual novel, it's a lovely blend of historical fiction and adventure from the likes of *Beowulf.* 

\-Simon Schama's *The Embarrassment of Riches*: bought it but haven't had time to read it. It's a social history about the Dutch Golden Age. Fairly lengthy book, but looking forward to it.

\-Jhumpa Lahiri's *Interpreter of Maladies*: a book I've connected with, especially the last short story, ""The Third and Final Continent."" Being an immigrant myself, I thought she captured beautifully the struggles of immigrant parents when they first arrived in the US.

books,"The Song of Ice and Fire series and the prequels (A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, Fire and Blood, A World of Ice and Fire) have enthralled me for many years and are one of my most beloved fantasy series. I was into them well before the show came around. I've always wondered where GRRM drew inspiration from and I thought to ask here. The big ones are Tolkien which he has mentioned, because of course Tolkien is basically the father of world-building. 

I was recently re-reading ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"" a story about a wandering hedge knight named Duncan and his squire, Egg who travel all across Westeros (similar size as Britain). One of the main themes of the book is Duncan's commitment to being a true knight: honorable, courteous and skilled at arms in a world where most knights are dishonest and false.

I thought it sounded familiar to Don Quixote which is also about a wandering knight who wants to be chivalrous and travels with a squire all around the country. Just like in GRRM's novella, they encounter many trials, challenges and people attempting to expose him as being just like everyone else.

I'm sure there are many more examples where George R.R. Martin was influenced in his works. Do you know of any books/authors that you think George R.R. drew light or heavy inspiration from?

‚Äú‚ÄúThose in this situation who call for more intellectual depth, more spirituality, have understood nothing, for the problem is that the intellect has taken over everything. Everything has become intellect, even our bodies, they aren‚Äôt bodies anymore, but ideas of bodies, something that is situated in our own heaven of images and conceptions within us and above us, where an increasingly large part of our lives is lived. The limits of that which cannot speak to us‚Äìthe unfathomable‚Äìno longer exist. We understand everything, and we do so because we have turned everything into ourselves. Nowadays, as one might expect, all those who have occupied themselves with the neutral, the negative, the nonhuman in art, have turned to language, that is where the incomprehensible and the otherness have been sought, as if they were to be found on the margins of human expression, on the fringes of what we understand, and of course, actually, that is logical: where else would it be found in a world that no longer acknowledges that there is a beyond?‚Äù",Karl ove knausgaard philosophy,1604510825

But before it's actually the 5th, when hordes of full grown juveniles will remember ""V for Vendetta' for little beyond ""Remember, remember, the fifth of november, gunpowder, treason and plot"", let us share this moment which in retrospect will either seem anti-climactic or pre-apocalyptic.¬†


On this most revered of dates we tread finely on the Road that will either lead us to liberty or to anarchy. But what is Liberty, except a lover out of our reach, bedded daily by Authority. And what is Anarchy, except a forbidden fruit, the consumption of which leads to instilling of both - envy and jealousy into Liberty and Authority.


Authority allows two roles: The torturer and the tortured. It twists people into joyless mannequins that fear and hate, while culture plunges into the abyss. Authority deforms the rearing of their children, makes a cockfight of their love. Authority‚Äôs collapse sends cracks through bedrooms, boardrooms, churches and schools alike. All is misrule.¬†


All convicts are hunched and deformed by the smallness of their cells, the weight of their chains and the unfairness of their sentences.

We can‚Äôt have too much of science, despite its nuclear quiirks. With science, ideas can germinate, within a bed of theory, form and practice that assists their growth, but we as gardeners must be aware. For some seeds are the seeds of ruin. And the most iridescent blooms are most often dangerous. That is why perhaps that the technology that was supposed to keep us together in a time when staying apart was essential, has left us feeling alone and smaller than ever before in the face of too much information and too many narratives.¬†


Then another voice within says that all these miseries are a part of life, and putting up with all of it is what makes it meaningful. In fact, the majority of people go through this silent ordeal every time they wake up.¬†


It doesn‚Äôt do well to rely too much on silent majorities, for silence is a fragile thing. One loud noise, and its gone. But the thing is that people are so cowed and disorganised, that even if a few might take the opportunity to protest, it‚Äôll be a voice in the wilderness. I hope going through this shared ordeal just makes us stronger, and we mature from agonists to protagonists.


We still have this inch of ours out here. Its small and its fragile, and its the only thing in the world that is worth having. We can‚Äôt lose it, sell it or give it away, we can‚Äôt let them take it away. I don‚Äôt know who you are, or whether you are a man or a woman. I may never see you, I will never hug you or cry with you or get drunk with you. But if you share this inch with me, I love you.

books,"When i picked this one up on the Apple Books app, i wasn't in need of something new to read, i have a backlog a mile long sitting on my (physical) shelves, as i am sure all of us here do, but the first copy was free and it looked interesting.

I'm now on the final one and it has been very cool, definitely recommend it, though probably read her other series in this world first, which i didn't even notice until i went looking for more, guess it will just be more of a prequel read for me.

The main reason i wanted to post was to share a laugh i was having with my wife;   
I've alwasy lightly teased her about her books being ""smutty vampire"" types, which i know they're not, and even if they were I wouldn't matter, it's just some fun between us.  
Last night she asked about what i was reading and i explained how this series is about how &gt;!dragons like to shapeshift into human or animal form to have a good time, leading to all sorts of magic type creatures being born!&lt;. She immediately started poking fun at me for the smutty books i was reading! Ooops! Heheheh.

In any case, if you are looking for something that has a perfect mix of sexual inuendo, light provocative encounters, with fantasy and magic, then Lindsay hits the mark.",Lindsay Buroker - Heritage of Power,1604465220
