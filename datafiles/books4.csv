books,"Hi,

So I just recently got introduced to romance novels. I find them fascinating. They focus on characters and what's going on in their minds, and how they feel, more so than hardly any other genre. That is the whole point, not just context for some plot points. Kinda mind blowing. These are some deep, deep dives into somebody's head. I can't believe I've never read one until now.

But I'm reading this and finding them a bit saucy. And there's issues with consent.

Those of you who *actually have read* at least one romance novel: How realistic are they?

I get it that it's a fantasy. But at the same time, this genre is based on realism, enough that you can believe the people, and the setting... it's not ""hot"" (... or ""romantic"") if it's not something you can invest in and believe in to some extent.

How realistic would you rate them from one to ten? What stuff is usually unrealistic? What stuff is usually realistic? Some topics I'm particularly thinking of:

**Consent/communication**: I'm shocked at some of the scenes where a woman just ""lets"" a guy's ""love"" come over her as a prelude to sex. Like, she isn't necessarily convinced it's right to do it, or the right time, but there she and he are, doing it. On the one hand, being conflicted about love and whether to go ahead to a next stage with someone in a relationship feels pretty realistic. On the other hand, it feels like society is trying to move away from that lack of outright communication, and that you should be able to firmly consent to romantic advances.

**Internal monologue, dialog**: Romance novels have these great descriptions of longing, great banter, arguments, all sorts of passion/romance/lust/courtship, etc... Is real life ever this flowery? This complicated? Or is life simpler and more boring for you? How much of the ""drama"" is true to you? (I know for me, just the complexity of having to think over (and ""feel"" over) whether I like somebody is more complex than any author could capture. But at the same time... Isn't it simpler sometimes in real life?)

**Drama**: Obviously, romance novels are pretty dramatic. How much of this feels true to your real life? How much is just pure fantasy invented by the authors?",How Realistic are Romance Novels?,1579045444

As 2020 has just begun, I've made my fair share of reading goals. Besides my amount of books and other goals to step out of my comfort zone, I've made a goal to revise and review all of my books this year.

It doesn't have to be a long essay every time, just enough to remember the books. I'm struggling with a good step by step approach which I would want to follow for each book, a template if you will.


With non-fiction I'd shortly revise the chapters, write down the overall message and some other facts.

With fiction, I've got no clue what might be a good approach.

I find it an interesting and important topic to help understand current political and cultural trends. All have been non-fiction, historical accounts, not overtly judgmental but certainly not favorable to such movements (i.e., not pro-movement propaganda). 

One book that is repeatedly featured in many of these accounts is The Turner Diaries, a 1978 unapologetically racist novel that has influenced a host of real-world bad actors to do horrific things, including Timothy McVeigh (who blew up the Murrah federal building in OKC) and many others. I'm considering reading it because of the central role it has played in these movements.

I've recently decided I need to get back into reading as much as I did in middle school. I missed it.

I love stories that drop characters into a remote, abandoned setting (ghost ship, outpost, etc.), usually to respond to a distress signal or investigate a disappearance, and slowly start to piece together the fate of the missing souls.

**Film**

* Event Horizon (1997)
* Prometheus (2012)
* The Twilight zone - Where is Everybody? (1959)
* Mines of Moria from LotR (2001) - I haven't read the book so I'm putting this in the film section, deal with it

* Bioshock (2007)
* Dead Space, kind of (2008)
* Myst games, kind of (Various)
* Obduction (2016)
* Hollow Knight (2017)

**Books**

* Sphere (1987)
* The section from Dracula about the Demeter (1897)

Did anyone here enjoy this book? My aunt and I love reading WWII books and she suggested this to me since it is her all-time favorite. 

I finished it today and I feel like the author just slapped me in the face. She made me read all of that, just to find out... Nothing. The beginning of the book is literally the ending. Nothing came out of it. I thought the book would explain how they go on from there until they die, but nope. So it's this story about a couple forever missing their ""deceased"" spouse just to find out in the end that they're not dead. That actually sounds kind of mean for the characters. Josef was able to finally let go a bit (burned the letters) and then he saw Lenka. That just seems like a step backwards in the story. 

I also felt like the story had little emotion for something so heavy. When Lenka was in the concentration camps, she mentioned Josef maybe twice? I didn't feel like she loved him, though I guess this could be explained by her being a little preoccupied with the fact that she's in a concentration camp. But that story didn't really hit me too emotionally, either. It seemed like everything was stated matter-of-factly, rather than like a story. 

I felt the most emotion in Josef, but again this all kind of seems ruined by the fact that he ends up seeing Lenka in the end.

There are books that I've seriously enjoyed and couldn't put down. Examples Name of the Wind and Wise Man's Fear, Dune, Hitchhikers Guide, You. (Clearly I have a thing for sci-fi)

Why did they turn her into what Zeena used to be? Because even though Zeena's troubles gave her that personality..she was always sort of that way. But Mattie was always really sweet. So I don't know why she would just change like that. I feel like I would still try to get out of there lol but that's personal and I don't know everything about that time period.

As someone whose grandmother was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, happening upon this plain, short book in a local bookshop seems almost like providence.

books,"I usually finish what I start, but these are the 10 books that I just couldn’t get through. Some are certainly controversial, and I’m ready to face the inevitable backlash and downvotes, but hopefully it sparks some discussion. Sorted by author’s surname;

**1. Red Rising, by Pierce Brown**

I just did not like Darrow, and couldn’t care less what happened to him. He was written as some average, everyday bloke who somehow can do no wrong and is good at everything all the time. A better written main character may have encouraged me to finish it because the premise wasn’t bad.

**2. Leviathan Wakes, by James S.A. Corey**

Started reading this hoping for it to be an epic space opera – boy was I wrong! Felt like a very generic sci-fi with boring, military characters, and the world just didn’t fill me with wonderment as a good sci-fi should, I’m afraid. But the reason I stopped reading was the almost high-school level of writing – it was so sub-par and full of clichés! Fancy a drinking game? Read through and take a shot every time the author uses the phrase “out of nowhere.”

**3. The Pillars of the Earth, by Ken Follett**

This book gets a ridiculous amount of mentions on Reddit and I’m dumbfounded as to why. It might as well be called “A series of unfortunate events that threaten the building of the cathedral that quickly and conveniently get resolved followed by a, not always consensual, sex scene”. I thought the writing was seriously bad, and the book was too damn long for me to even consider finishing.

**4. The Girl on the Train, by Paula Hawkins**

I only started reading this because my wife was reading at the same time – neither of us could finish it. Pathetic, unlikeable characters. Slow, tedious unengaging plot. It was a mess from start to ~~finish~~ half-way!

**5. Lolita, by Vladimir Nabokov**

Started this because I felt it was an important piece of literary work that I just HAD to read, despite knowing about the controversial subject matter. I could appreciate the writing and mesmerising prose, but I just noped out of the book a third of the way through with no intention of going back. I just don’t have the stomach for it!

**6. Master and Commander, by Patrick O'Brian**

I really REALLY wanted to like this book because the film is one of my favourites, and I LOVE books about old ships. But I can’t quite put my finger on why I couldn’t finish it. I think the pacing was a bit erratic – there’d be pages and pages of nautical talk followed by a battle at sea that would be over in the blink of an eye. Also, I found the characters (who were all male) incredibly bitchy. To be fair, I probably will finish this book at some point when I’m in the mood to be out at sea again!

**7. The Republic, by Plato**

Wanted to get in to philosophy and thought this would be a good starting point. Quickly learned that philosophy just isn’t my cup of tea! It started off as a delightful read, and I felt like I was in a grand villa among some of the greatest thinkers in history, discussing some really profound ideas. But then I just got lost, unfortunately, and felt like I should sneak out of the villa to see something that made me feel less stupid. Have the Olympic games been founded yet?

**8. The Rise of Endymion, by Dan Simmons**

The fourth and final book in Dan Simmons’ EPIC Hyperion Cantos. I was so close to finishing it…so close! But I inexplicably stopped caring about Raul and Aenea. It’s strange, even though the writing is still very much top tier and beautiful at times, it felt like a completely different tale to the one I fell in love with when reading Hyperion (probably my all-time favourite sci-fi book). I may pick it up again to see how the story ends, but it’ll likely be a skim read I’m sorry to say. Nevertheless, if you haven’t read Hyperion – do it now!

 **9. Children of Time, by Adrian Tchaikovsky**

Interesting premise, but I just couldn’t bring myself round to caring about spiders, and the human characters for that matter. I also don’t think it was very well written – no personal stories, no touching moments, no humour. A LOT of time is passing by apparently but I didn’t really get a sense of the scale. Disappointed, because the reviews are overwhelmingly good.

**10. The Lord of the Rings, by J.R.R. Tolkien**

I’m sorry Reddit, I’m so deeply and truly sorry. I watch all three of the films at least twice a year and know Fellowship by heart, and FINALLY dove in to this book with the giddy enthusiasm of my teenage self seeing the films for the first time. But the thing that stopped me from finishing the book (and this may seem trivial) was….all the bloody singing! It seemed that any time anything inconsequential happened, a character would spontaneously burst in to song. I tried to look past it after the first few melodies but then it just became jarring. I get that the book was written a long time ago and having your protagonists sing about anything and everything was probably normal back then, but it just completely baffled and exhausted me to be honest. I hope to be able to pick it up again someday, and attempt to look past the singing…BUT IT IS NOT THIS DAY!",The 10 books I haven't been able to finish,1579012846

since I spend around 2-3 hours in my car each day, I was thinking about 'reading' audiobooks so that those hours don't feel wasted anymore. However, my native language is not English, so I think I might need to start with books that are not too hard. Any recommendations on that front? Maybe a book that I've read before?

I was also just wondering if you guys listen to a lot of audiobooks, and if it's easy to follow while you are also paying attentions to other things (such as, you know, the road...)
