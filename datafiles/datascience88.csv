I’m currently a masters student in business analytics, and previously a chemical engineer, so I had some exposure to analytics, but not as much data science. Since starting my masters, I’ve devoted 200% of my time (helps that I’m home all day) to learning as much as I can about DS, ML, DL, data engineering...

I’ve watched hundreds of videos and believe to have learned surface knowledge on many of those topics. I’ve done projects that each solve a “business/personal goal” in my life (I don’t find some random kaggle dataset to analyze). For example, I deployed a music recommendation system web app using KNN. I programmed a sudoku solver with OpenCV and trained a CNN on the MNIST digits. I’ve also made live tableau dashboard with a data pipeline to MySQL with Apache airflow. I plan on learning AWS and perhaps try for the cloud practitioner certificate to really round everything off.

Each of these projects has really helped me better understand the world of data. I am proud of each of them bc I felt like I levelled up when I complete them. However, now I feel like at my limit of what I can do by myself. Im really not sure how to move forward at this point.

datascience,"This question is primarily to understand how you all think of structuring your code and/or file system structure for projects. There are times when what I need to do is very well defined, and it's easy to think of a package structure for a version-controlled package of code within a Docker container that I can develop on and deploy. Other times I'm doing what seems like a simple ""one-off"" type of analysis that's meant to support or check the results of a more major line of work, do some computation and hand off something to someone else in a different format, etc. Often I'll do this type of work in a different directory that's not version controlled, because I don't want to complicate it by adding it to my clean code base or create options for my existing code base that are unlikely to be used in the future and will complicate its interface. However, sometimes these ""one-offs"" build momentum, and become more persistent and important, and I often struggle with finding the right time to put them into the official package (or their own) versus letting them exist on the side as one-offs (and modifications thereof).

A related issue is that when my code is not structured into a well-thought out package, my directory structure tends to look like this:

    .
    └── new_project
        ├── data_prep
        │   ├── prepare_data.py
        │   └── raw_data
        │       └── raw_data_file
        └── run_model
            ├── model_code.py
            └── try_with_mod
                ├── model_code1.py
                ├── output_explore.ipynb
                ├── with_more_iterations
                │   └── model_code1.py
                └── write_out_intermediate_for_jim
                    └── model_code1_for_jim.py

The problem with this structure is a couple things:

(1) Sometimes the number of \`try\_with\_mod\` trees can get pretty nested in ways which are difficult to manage from a git branch perspective. On the other hand, when they do get nested they do convey useful information on the time-ordered progression of my projects, something that branching in git doesn't necessarily preserve. That time-ordered progression is one of the main reasons I keep this directory structure and have to actively fight against it.

(2) The code I put into \`write\_out\_intermediate\_for\_jim\` is usually something quick and hacky to give someone an intermediate result and is not version controlled. Not having it version controlled or documented is just not a great practice.

Do any of you struggle with these types of situations? How do you view the trade-offs of clean, well organized code bases versus one-offs? Do you have a better way or organizing your one-offs than to create subdirectories like I've outlined here?","How to choose between a well-structured code base for all analysis, a collection of one-off scripts, and the spectrum in between?",1615653409

It's an interesting and important topic but am I alone in thinking that most of the articles written about this show a complete lack of understanding about what machine learning is, how it works and even what bias and discrimination are and that data science and data scientists are generally pretty silent about this or even seem to go along with the accusations so as not to be seen somehow as pro-discrimination?

I watched something (I think from Google) about this recently where one of their senior DS/MLEs was talking about how an algorithm was biased because it was more likely to predict men earned $50k+ than women. But isn't it a fairly established fact that men on average earn more than women and so you'd expect a higher % of men to earn above 50k and so any good algorithm should be picking that up? To fix this ""problem"", you'd essentially have to doctor your data until you get the result you want. Which is just nuts.

I'm not saying there's not any ethical issues around these kinds of topics at all. DS should be aware and responsible for not reinforcing discrimination that already exists but if the world and the data it produces have biases, discrimination and even just plain old differences between groups built into it, DS should be reflecting that.

datascience,"So I'm currently working as a data analyst and I want to move toward transitioning to a data engineer role. I have a degree in economics but stats isn't my favourite. I love working on ETL stuff though.  


Where I currently work we use SQL Server and Excel pretty extensively, Tableau and Prep often and R very occasionally. I have no Python at all but I'm really strong in SQL. All my ETL work at the moment is done in either SQL or Prep, and a little bit in powerquery. I am looking at developing my skillset and think I'm settled on the data engineer track on Datacamp (I have a membership through work)

The course covers the following

* Python
* Shell
* Bash
* Airflow
* Scala
* Pyspark
* SQL Server 
* Mongo DB

I'm already pretty strong in SQL so those bits aren't new but the rest is. My question is, is this a good skillset to get started? Its a long course and I'll learn loads. Happy to divert off and learn supplimentary material when needed. But is this the right track? or should I be looking somewhere else and learning some other set of skills?",Transition to Data Engineer,1615585553

datascience,"Hey folks,

So I've just been hired as a data science/BI analyst. It's a bit of a situation of having been hired as a plumber to do a pool job (I've got a deep background in maths and modeling work, but haven't ever really touched on this stuff). 

I know a lot of the work will be pulling things from SQL, and making sense of them with various Python modules. That being said, I've never worked with SQL, and have a few questions on how exactly it interfaces with the company's data servers. 

1) How do I figure out what SQL ""protocol"" I will need to use? Will the company have some sort of SQL terminal that can be accessed by individuals with certain login credentials? Or will I have download a specific program and then link it up to the company's servers? 

2) I am doing some upskilling on DataCamp right now. It is great for learning general syntax, but I feel like I am lacking a contextual perspective. Any other resources you would recommend to learn, quickly, how SQL actually is used by companies to execute on specific projects?

datascience,"Hello!

Over the last 9 months, my friends and I have built a web application, called SuiSense, that uses Natural Language Processing to determine whether an inputted text is either depressive or suicidal. While other applications have been built to diagnose between Suicide and Healthy text, none have been used to differentiate suicide from depression, which are very different in the ways they are approached and treated. We have built a series of models for initial mental health screening, and we think our app can be used primarily by friends and family who are concerned about a loved one, or even therapists. So far, we have presented our solution to local therapists, who have all shown interest. Here is a video demo of our application: [https://youtu.be/QHpKJBVObhA](https://youtu.be/QHpKJBVObhA).

To legitimize the algorithm, we have recently written a paper (currently in review) that demonstrates the performance of the algorithm using state-of-the-art NLP models, and to improve performance, we used a label correction method to clean the labels, as the data is trained on Reddit data from [r/depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/) and [r/SuicideWatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/).

We would really appreciate it if anyone who saw this could give our **repository a star on Github** so that we could try to grow our application. If you have any time, if you could check out the website and provide any feedback, that would be great. **And of course**, if you or anyone you know could benefit from the application, please let us know and possibly consider using it.

datascience,"Dear All,

I need some help with planning my Machine Learning journey.

Background: Electrical Engineer with Graduate Degree working in R&amp;D advisory. Over 15 years of experience. Not looking to change careers. In my work, I need to read a large number of technical publications, research papers etc. Many times, projects involve short timelines and therefore someone who can extract deep insights from these vast documents can be quite valuable. Therefore, I want to learn manipulating large volume of text and extract information from them. I also need to identify technically similar documents (clustering and similarity detection). Additionally, I would also like to learn methods to develop a model that can ""rank"" these technical documents. For example, scoring each paper based on parameters like number of authors, author affiliations, author country etc. (if at all it is possible).

What I have done: Bunch of courses on Udemy related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP. Also did an Online Certificate program in Machine Learning. Have ""hacked"" together some Python scripts that do things like Topic Modeling and Hierarchical Clustering etc.

Problems: 1) I understand how ML algorithms work but can't code them from scratch. I rely on Scikit Learn etc. 2) I do not know Object Oriented Programming 3) I am comfortable with Mathematics but have no energy to refresh my Linear Algebra or Calculus Concepts 4) I do not know Git 5) I do not know how to deploy models

My Goal: To be able to perform text mining at scale (it is common that I am dealing with 50K technically dense documents) and deploy the developed techniques as web service.

How do I go about this? Any textbooks, courses?

datascience,"Hi! I'm studying data science and got a project here as a homework. I made a logistic regression model to predict some rare events (3% or less). This event is labeled as my ""1"". Then, instead of getting an ideal model with perfect balance sensitivity and specificity, I did what every shithead would do and focused on creating a model who would predict the ""0"" or non-event with an ""marvellous"" precision, ignoring all the false positives. (To do that, I filtered all the scenarios where the probability of 0 would be grater than a high value).
Result: I got a specificity of 99.95% (yaaay!) and a sensitivity of 2% or something like that. 
But now, I'm looking for the probabilities for each scenario being 0 or 1 (I'm using python and the predict_proba() method, if it's a useful info).
I would like to assess these probabilities and I was told the log loss would be the ideal tool. I did it for the model and got a really shitty value (0.98 or something like that). This got me thinking: Is this value specific for the probabilities of ""1"" and, therefore, I could use the (1 - 0.98) to assess the probabilities of non-event (""0"")? I guess probably not but that's my doubt.

So in cases like this, where just specificity matters (and it shows a semi-perfect value), how should I assess the probabilities (outputs of the model) individually?

One avenue I've used to get experience was volunteering for a political campaign's data team.  Campaigns are ALWAYS looking for extra help, and will usually be happy to assign you some easy data cleaning or analysis tasks that you can use to hone your skills.

To get started, I reached out to the data/tech director for a mid-size PAC (after finding them on LinkedIn) and asked if they had any data volunteering opportunities.  If you can't find this person, reach out to anyone in the campaign and ask if they know who to talk to.  Within a few days they had me sign an NDA and I was working on getting insights out of their textbanking data - figuring out which messaging was working best, weeding out phone numbers that volunteers should have added to the opt-out list but didn't, etc.

datascience,"I’m looking to find a niche as to build a domain specific expert to that complement my data science background.

In general, I think it’s quite common that data scientists can work on almost any datasets they can find and build intuition from there to find insights, and build relevant models. Worse case scenario there will always be a domain expert who can help to better understand the datasets or objectives.

I hope to specialize myself into a particular niche like cyber security. I’m still open to other areas but cyber security seems to be quite a logical progression given that it deals with data generated by IT systems (machines) as opposed to data generated by humans.

From my experience I rather deal with this kind of machine generated datasets than human ones.

Other than that I find cyber security topics to be interesting in general and thought that I may want to specialize in this area as well.
