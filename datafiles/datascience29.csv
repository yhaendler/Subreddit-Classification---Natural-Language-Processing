See what I did there? I posted a link with a bit of an explanation. That's fine. If you want to know more, you have to go to their content on their site. We all do that in our social media feeds. Putting all their content on my site so readers don't need to go to theirs is theft. It doesn't matter if I put the attribution somewhere with the post. No permission=theft.

When another site wants to repost something I've written, they send me a message and ask for permission. That's been the way it is done for the eight years I have been writing. With a site like KDNuggets, I am always good with giving them the OK and not asking for compensation. Some major outlets will ask me to rebuild a post to appeal to their target audience. They have millions of readers. I do that for free too.

I have worked with consulting companies. They want content to drive people to their site as a form of organic marketing. It's usually pretty fluffy, buzzword bingo type posts. I get paid for that. If someone is advertising their services on the site, they are making money off that site and you should too.

I have worked with companies that make products. They want technical content to explain how to use their product in the real world. Again, they use that content to market their products. I get paid for that and you should too.

In the research world, works are cited. There can be a longer quotation from the original work which will have the primary authors' names next to it. Supporting works without quotes will be linked to at the end of the research paper. That's fine. Copy paste research, paraphrasing, releasing implementations as original works, all of that is plagiarism. That gets you blacklisted.

I have posted content that was very close to someone else's. They posted first. I issued an apology and a link to their content. It happens.

· Store location and size (in square metres);

· Type of store (large or small convenience store);

· Customer buying habits, measured as the frequency with which products were bought in each department over the last year; and

· Median income of the surrounding suburb, in thousands of Rand's.

The standard volume of a cereal box is 3,000 cm 3.



You are asked to assist with the following problems:

· **Problem 1:** Optimize the amount of shelf space to use for cereal boxes.

· **Problem 2:** Determine which brands of cereal to sell in which stores.

· **Problem 3:** Identify cereals that are often bought together so that they can be placed close to one another on the shelves.

datascience,"Hey everyone, 

I spent a lot of time on A/B testing during my time last job. For me, A/B testing was a way to be more involved in product development and have a more say in what ultimately got shipped. Honestly, I really enjoyed it.

One of the things I realized was that there's a big mismatch between what you learn in statistics textbooks and how experimentation works in practice. Being successful at A/B testing isn't really about analytical methods. It's about process and people. Here are some of the things I learned.

Note: These are all based on my experience, and may not reflect every situation. Take each with an ounce of salt.

# Know what kind of test you're running

This isn't about t-tests or z-tests. It's not about Bayesian vs. frequentist methods. You have to set the context for the experiment. Uncertainty before the test leads to incorrect decisions after the test. Under what circumstances will you roll out the variant? Does it have to significantly outperform the control or just break even? What size impact do you expect and how long will the test run for?

I like breaking these down into:

* Big bets
* Iterative
* Health checks
* Danger zone

# Get everything down in writing

Running an A/B test at scale is a cross-functional endeavor. Chances are it will involve Data Science and Analytics, Product, Engineering, and potentially Design as well. With all of these different touchpoints, you need a ""source of truth"" document. This is something that you can point people to for sufficient context. 

This allows you to:

* Coordinate between teams
* Reduce the likelihood of bias
* Document learnings for future reference

# Determine your primary metric

Related to the last point of writing things down, you should state what metrics you care about before the test. I like breaking these up into primary, secondary, and ""will monitor"" in most cases.

This seems straightforward, but it can be difficult. What if you are running a checkout optimization test and you find that the variant improves the number of conversions, but lowers the average purchase value? How do you deal with these conflicting variables? There are lots of considerations, but having a unified view upfront about which metric matters most will make your life easier come decision time.

# Partner with engineering where needed

I'm not sure how A/B testing infrastructure is set up at your organization. I've found that it varies greatly from company to company. There are huge tech companies that have everything baked in and then there are smaller startups where it's the wild west. If you aren't the former, assignment logic is never as easy as it seems.

You should spec out in the written document who is being assigned, what unique id they are being assigned on, and when that assignment is occurring. This complexity needs to be handled if your infrastructure doesn't handle it for you. You may need to partner with engineering to get things implemented in the right way. It's not the most interesting work in the world, but it's worth investing the time and effort to get this right.

# Turn insights into future tests

So, you have finally run the test and waited patiently for results. This is where things get exciting! Oddly enough, data scientists get lazy here. They report on the key metrics, name the winning variant, and call it a day.

The most interesting parts of an A/B test are buried in the analysis. This is where you learn about how people use your product. You should write up this analysis and share it with everyone involved in the testing process as part of your reporting. This analysis will often surface other hypotheses that will lead to more tests and so on. This is the cyclical nature of experimentation. Tests aren't linear. They feed into each other.

# Productize your thinking

When you hit a certain scale, data scientists shouldn't be managing every test. Create or adopt tools and infrastructure that encapsulates their thinking so others can run tests on their own. It's a tough transition to get here both technically and culturally, but it's a transition that you'll have to make one day. It should be on your mind, ideally before it's already too late.

RSS feed readers ingest content and republish it with credit to the author. This step gives the author added exposure, like how radio stations offer musicians free advertising to sell their music.

Examples of news aggregators include Google News, Drudge Report, Huffington Post, Fark, Zero Hedge, Newslookup, Newsvine, World News (WN) Network and Daily Beast, where the aggregation is entirely automatic

I see that the automated algorithm was incorrectly listing the admin as the author on some of the articles, but there was no intent to deceive. If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of EACH ARTICLE, and that linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR. One more time: If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of each piece that then linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR. 

There was no intent to claim ownership. If so, it was a pretty hair-brained try, but I apologize to anyone who feels deserving.

It was built as a news aggregator to promote the work of others and create a place to stay up to date without navigating to hundreds of sources (yes hundreds). That IS what news aggregators do!

I had a one on one meeting for a class that was in the minor for data science and the teacher asked me if I was planning to apply for the MSBA. I told the teacher that I already had and was fortunate enough to be wait-listed instead of denied.

I know how to write an email to ask for a recommendation, but not in this situation. Always formal yes but I see this as a very delicate matter as me and the accounting professor only talked a handful of times and I had a mediocre grade in the class (though I think he might remember me on a story I was telling that caught his interest).

AWS offers an ML specialisation certification, and Azure offer Data Scientist certifications - are they valuable or coveted in any way?

However, given that we don’t have any chartered certifications within the field, and there are a plethora of certifications one can obtain from udemy or coursera - are certifications from established platforms such as AWS or Azure a desirable trait from an employee’s and employer’s perspective?

Whenever training goals are proposed internally, these certifications often crop up.

A career that will have the least amount of social interaction and will be in demand in Bangladesh and that will in skilled occupation list in countries like Canada or Australia. Because frankly speaking the environment for people with disabilities is downright horrible here. 

I was reading the book Getting a Big Data Job for Dummies and the book says that there are only three career streams in Big Data: Data Scientist, Programmer and Business Analyst. Now I cannot become a programmer or Data Scientist because I don't have a background in CSE but Business Analyst also requires a huge amount of sales, customer service and client interaction.

But I can't do much else. My job search has been bad for these reasons, I think.

\- Is a degree in mathematics necessary?

datascience,"Hey all,

I recently graduated with an MS in stats with the goal of pursuing a data analyst career. Outside of school, I don't really have any data analysis projects to show off. I worked pretty exclusively in R and am learning some python now. My question is sort of two fold. First, I need to update my resume now that I've graduated. What are the necessary things one should include in a resume for a data analyst position? Doing my studies I took classes from all kinds of stats departments, e.g., math stats which included a good amount of theory with application, biostats, and stats perhaps used more frequently in the social sciences, e.g. SEMs. So I'm more a jack of all trades. Is that something that is worth highlighting, for example? Second, what does a good data analyst resume \*look\* like? What do hiring managers actually care to see beyond education and work history?  


In a similar vein, what things can I do to make my resume more appealing? For example, what are the kinds of projects I should work on independently to show off? And how much should I branch into proper programming? I was thinking learning how to make APIs in python might be a now essential skill for a data analyst? Is it worthwhile to spend my time learning SQL vs picking it up on the job? Things of that nature.  


Any direction/guidance/resources would be appreciated!",What does a good Data Analyst resume look like?,1589745396
