books,"Well, the title is self-explanatory but I will extend myself a bit. My girl's stepdad lent me the book last weekend, said it was a good book, easy reading and very interesting. As Flowers for Algernon is published by my favorite publisher in Brazil I've always had it on radar, but never bought because I'm more of a space opera, Asimov's robots and PKD-like craziness fan. Nonetheless, I decided to grab the book and in less than 48 hours I consumed it, or it consumed me.

The way Daniel Keyes gives voice for Charlie in his journals, especially in the beginning of the book is marvelous, plus the author's psychological knowledge makes us to go deep into the questions that he brings to light. Anyways, I'm out of words and wasn't expecting it to hit me as hard as it did. 

Would like to know if you guys had the same experience with Flowers for Algernon. (And STRONGLY RECOMMEND the reading of the book if you've been researching about it, but like me, was not still able to make your mind)",I've just read Flowers for Algernon. I'm speechless.,1606262209

“Entering Madcliffe”

The Sky is jet black and dotted with white circles, a dark maroon mustang rips through the air on a vast road in rural Carolina. A tall muscular but feminine female sits behind the wheel, her kite structured face with bow shaped lips, almond shaped hazel colored eyes, and ivory skin framed by the moonlight alongside her medium lengthened thick curly blonde hair softly billowing in the wind with the top of the car down. She is a supernatural hunter and has come to Carolina following a werewolf connected to the death of her family, she just past the “Entering Madcliffe: Pop. 3,556” and her soul burns with hatred for everything supernatural.

Name? Claire Garland, born in 1993 on the 20th of June in the New York State to Lydia and David Garland alongside her brothers Elliot and Noah in a farm outside Rochester. Growing alongside the supernatural was the normal since 1698 and truth be told, Claire loves the supernatural. Correction, loved. In 2009, on a cool foggy night just after a rainstorm and just after her siblings and her had been put to bed, they invaded. A Vampire, a Witch, and a Werewolf had broke through the gate and in a flash she heard her mother screaming.

9:12 Pm, she is dreaming of school then is awoken by the screams of her mother and bolts up alongside her siblings.

9:14 Pm, father comes in and tells his frightened children to hide.

9:15 Pm, he leaves.

9:18 Pm, Claire hears her father “Please no-just take me! Leave my family alive! Please!”

9:22 Pm, silence, beforehand terrifying screams like a banshee.

9:37 Pm, still silence.

9:58 Pm, still just silence.

10:12 Pm, Elliot goes out and leaves Noah with Claire, the door flies off its hinges and in a flash Elliot is a heap of blood. Noah rushes out to protect Claire but the witch turns him to ash. Suddenly two persons, a man and a woman downstairs break in rush upstairs. It’s auntie Helen and Uncle Marti-

Claire shakes her head, clearing those thoughts and pulls into a diner called “Auntie Janets Grill”

“Auntie Janets Grill Part One”

Claire opens the door to her mustang, her maroon leather jacket blending in with her car while her black skinny jeans blend into the night, her m1911 pistol slightly creating a bulge in her jacket

she walks up to the diner which is nestled in tall trees, it’s not big nor small, not popular nor inactive, normal yet crawling with creatures. Claire thinks ‘quaint, quiet, rustic...optimal’

she opens the door which creates a chime, a female waitress says “Hello, grab a table or seat at the bar, someone will be with you in a tight minute”

Claire strolls up to the bar and takes a seat, looking around to see possible vampires, wizards or witches, and some werewolves but some do look distinctly human

A woman in her 50s in a dark blue waitress uniform rolls up behind the bar with a notepad in hand

“Hello welcome to Auntie Janets Grill, I’m Waitress Boyer, what can I get you hun” says Waitress Boyer

“Hello, I’ll take a dark coffee, no addings, and I need information” says Claire

The waitress tenses, now realizing the bulging pistol in Claire’s jacket

“Sure thing, and....what information...I’ll also need your supernatural hunters license” says the waitress

Claire pulls out a wallet and takes out a small rectangle shaped card which reads REGISTERED SUPERNATURAL HUNTER:ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE SUPERNATURAL alongside other information

“All right, I’ll get your coffee ms Garland and....information” says the waitress

Claire looks around the dinner again and now sees several eyes on her, she thinks ‘mistake showing that license, people now know and judging these looks, they favor the supernatural’

After 2 minutes, the waitress comes back with a black coffee and sets it down then leans her elbows on the bar

“Alright what do you need?” says the waitress

“Auntie Janets Diner Part Two”

Claire sips her coffee then looks around before leaning in 

“A werewolf, Alan Clark. 6 foot 2, 180 pounds, wears dark woodsy attire. Last seen in a Mercury XR4Ti with a busted fender and green paint job. His right arm is in a sling and he has bruising around his right eye, both courtesy of me” says Claire

“Well, I don’t know cars but a fellow did come in matching that description, made a real fuss” says the waitress

“What do you mean?” says Claire

“Well he came in frightened, said he was being chased by a blazing blonde storm-guess that’s you-and he got into a fight with our regular mr Fowler just socked him, right in the face” says the waitress

suddenly a patron calls the waitress over and leaves Claire alone who writes the information down in a small black journal while sipping her coffee more

The door chimes, Claire turns to see a tall handsome muscular man who appears to be a policeman. CORP. BARK is on a silver rectangle on his uniform, he goes and sits and flags down the waitress who comes to his table then walks away and seconds later enters the kitchen.

The waitress comes out with a plate and opens a glass dome container on the counter with a cue card reading “raspberry pie”, she cuts a slice and puts it on the plate then walks over to his table and sets it down

“Waitress can I have you?” says Claire to the waitress who was talking to the policeman, she rises her head and walks behind the bar.

“Sure, what now” says the waitress

“Clark, where is he now?” says Claire

“Oh, that fine officer over there was here when it happened and arrested him, imagine he just came back from the sheriffs department putting him away” says the waitress

Claire gets up leaving her coffee and dropping 5$ bill on counter. She walks over to the mans table and sits down, his pie slice half gone already.

“Can I help you ma’am?” says the policeman

“Look it was my understanding that you arrested a man just earlier who assaulted somebody?” says Claire

“Yes? Umm..why? Friend of yours?” says the policeman

“God no, look can I....see him?” says Claire

“Only if your immediate family or a close friend but judging by that god no, imma guess and say neither” says the policeman who now drops his fork which had raspberry pie on it

“Look-I want-no I need to see him, please” Claire says while leaning in, trying to give the cop her best face

the cop juggles his thoughts for a few seconds before putting on his hat and rising

“Alright...but you need to tell me why your so desperate to see him” says the policeman

Claire rises “First, Claire Garland, registered Supernatural Hunter and.......this man may know the werewolf clan whose member helped....kill my family” says Claire

The cop gets out of the booth and slaps down some money then walks alongside Claire as they leave the diner, talking to her

“Corporal Joshua Bark, and I’m sorry to hear that and also I am a werewolf my self” says Joshua while opening the side door of his squad car, gesturing for Claire to get in

“Wait-my car, I can’t leave it here and also the name, Bark?” says Claire

“I can get someone to get it. Also yes, hardy hardy har, my ancestor was Nathaniel Bark who met a female werewolf-just please get in the car” says Joshua

Claire gets into the squad car and Joshua drives out and into the town, Claire sees the bustling town called Madcliffe more and more

The Meme Machine by Susan Blackmore: I listened to Susan Blackmore's podcast interview on the Pansycast and I'm interested in learning more about her ideas on memetics.

The Biggest Bluff by Maria Konnikova: I majored in psychology and I'm still very much a psychology nerd. I'm also interested in it because it's tangentially related to Queen's Gambit since they're both stories about women dominating in a male-dominated field.

Stop Reading the News by Rolf Dobelli: The title should be self-explanatory. One of the themes I'm learning from the books I've been reading recently is that news media has always been faulty and unreliable in terms of both how it represents the world and in delivering information. If you want to cure your doomscrolling, this might be the right book to read.

Turns out this is #4 in the Penn Cage series!!@!@@!#!@#@!!@  


Dang it. I'm kind of invested in the book, all I usually read/listen to is fantasy books, so I thought a one-book break would be Ok, and for 35 hours, a pretty good value for an Audible credit.

books,"*In which we meander along the Thames with Montmorency and his three companions.*

Three Men in a Boat is one of the few novels I own with the dubious honour of having been attempted twice and completed once. That’s not to say the tale isn’t an enjoyable and light read, more that it requires a certain mood to succeed. Much like *Cold Comfort Farm*, it’s a relatively brief diversion that is best read at speed as you surrender to its charms for a few nights.

The first time around I perhaps made the mistake of treating the novel too reverentially and reading too little at a time. Much like many a romantic comedy, it’s an entertaining tale but if you take a break halfway through, you’re liable to guess at the ending rather than return. You’d probably be wrong by the way, as entering the final chapter there seems so much yet to achieve in so few pages.

Thankfully, after several months I returned. I started where all good readers start, from the beginning, and stopped a week later as I read the price on the back cover (50p many, many years ago). I thoroughly enjoyed the journey this time, winding my way as a fourth man in the boat along the gently drifting currents of the Thames from pubs to picnic spots, through devious locks and along meandering towpaths. 

It’s the oddest thing, *Three Men and a Boat* could have been written this year. Three businessmen taking a trip out of London along the river, dropping in on lodging houses and historical sites sounds like a ready-made blog or YouTube series. It’s not just the concept, the jokes land as well today as (I assume) they did in 1889.

Jerome’s writing is crisp and observational, slipping between comic scenes and well-worn truths of life, such as how a kettle must be ignored to boil, and a free morning is bound to lead to an early rise. The three men of the title squabble and argue their way along the Thames, each taking the side of whoever seems in most agreement with them at the time.

As [Robert McCrum writes in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/10/100-best-novels-three-men-boat-jerome), “like all the finest comic writing, it's about everything and nothing.”

Originally planned as a travel guide, Jerome expanded the comedic elements of his writing and abandoned the idea. Despite this, the travelogue elements underpin the story and drive it forward – giving the necessary straight-faced backdrop to the farcical tale. This accuracy means that fans of the book can recreate the journey today down to visiting the same pubs – in fact, the BBC filmed exactly that in 2005 with three comedians. 

I don’t hesitate to recommend a week with *Three Men in a Boat*. It is, quite naturally, a perfect choice for a holiday read – perhaps both to divert the reader from the tedium and frustration of modern travel and to reassure them that it has never been possible to get from one place to another without incident. Whether you’re holiday bound or not, the novel is a rare find – comedy writing that makes you laugh. And that’s worth whatever cover price you find.",My review of Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K Jerome,1606257309

books,"I've literally just set the book down, so I hope you'll forgive this stream-of-consciousness. 

At fifteen, I read my first King book - 'salem's Lot. It was the start of my own journey to the Dark Tower, though I didn't know it at the time. It was the book that bridged ""young adult"" and ""adult"" fiction for me; my first step over the line that divided the two halves of the library. And though I've never stopped reading books for children or teenagers, I've also never forgotten the weight of that first ""adult"" book in my hands. It was like a coming-of-age, though I didn't know it at the time. 

I read 'salem's Lot. And then, The Shining. IT. The Stand. I fell in love with his emotionally raw style of writing, and his turns of phrase - the branches of winter trees *snarling* against moonlit skies; the *enamelled* *black* of a tarred road on a hot day; the *wrecked beauty* of an actress. 

The more I read, the more hints I came across to something greater in his work. Connections started to emerge. The Turtle, from IT. Randall Flagg, from The Stand, and Through the Eyes of the Dragon. Strange parallel worlds, in The Talisman and From a Buick 8. Engines that seemed too alive, too malicious, for their own good, like Christine. 

And then I found the Dark Tower books, and it started to come together. Roland and his doomed ka-tets, first with Cuthbert and Alain and then with Eddie and Susannah and Jake and Oy. The road to the Tower. Randall Flagg. The Crimson King. 

I wanted to know so badly what was in the top of the Tower for Roland. And I'm only just realising it now, but he found what he needed the most - redemption. The original books are a doomed quest, a journey that sets him up on a next journey that he can only take in our minds. A journey where he makes the choices not only to take him to the Tower, but to make him worthy of it - and to give him the chances to protect his friends, and save his ka-tet, from his own grim reckless determination. 

I believe he'll find that redemption. 

For me, though - I haven't read even half of King's works, but I think I'll take a break from now. His worlds are painful, at times, in how realistic their balances of hope and cynicism can be. I'm devastated that Roland has to endure his journey again, and my own hope is that it will be for the better, but I think I need to step away and let all of this settle down in me for now.  I do wish we'd seen more of Cuthbert - he really stole my heart. 

Thank you for reading all of this. Please let me know what you think of the Dark Tower. It's been a very long journey. I don't think I'll have another one like it in this lifetime.","[SPOILERS] After seven years, I've finished reading The Dark Tower series, by Stephen King.",1606256494

This book is the first of what would become a trilogy from the same author about the Chinese continuous struggle from the overthrow of empire in 1911 to the communist victory in 1949. As the dates on the cover suggest, the timeline covered is far too much for such a tiny book, so it will mostly deal with chronology and uniform details. By the time you reach the end, you already forgot the beginning.

The text is adequate but focus mostly on the Nationalist faction. Given they bore the brunt of the fight from 1928 to 1945, that makes sense but there is a lot of duplication regarding uniforms and 3 (three!) tables of ranks for the Republican Army (followed by the warlords), the Nationalist Army, the Manchukuo Army with lengthy descriptions of colours that could - and should - have been done far more easily in the plates. The soldiers are mainly poor guys forced into one army or another and, as part of the dance of politics, are forced into the armies of the victors (if they are not shot, that is).

The main quality of this book is to give a visual guide and structure of the period, and that I can say it does very well. From the Westernized Imperial Army to the motley Warlord armies, to the more recognizable pro- and anti-Japanese armies of the end of the story. The weapons came from all around the world but there were always more men than guns (artillery was a luxury), so you see lance-armed soldiers in the 1940's. Child soldiers, bandits, beggars, warlord officers that are no more than mafiosos, White Russians, professional soldiers... We have it all. The Warlords dressed like peackocks and ""would design their own awards and hand them out to their officers and friendly fellow Warlords like trinkets"" and ruled like brutal feudal lords.

The creation of the Nationalist Army creates a rethink: the Warlords would never relinquish power and this lead to the idea of an army to enforce the rule of law over all of China. The Nationalists defeated the Warlords in 1928, by being institutionally stronger and becoming the dominant power in China; but would get encroached by the Japanese already in 1931. The Nationalists would be hailed as national heroes for their heroic stand against Japanese bullying in Shanghai in 1932. The author says in a caption they beat-off the Japanese, which they certainly didn't, but their resistance was embarassing for the Japanese. They still lost, but the seed of nationalism was planted.

A very welcome surprise was the introduction of the ""puppet"" armies, with Manchukuo and the other pro-Japanese forces, but beyond uniform and equipment there is very little. The plate of puppet Emperor Pu Yi was a great choice. The organisation was also a good addition. The author then short-sells the Nationalists for the rest of the book and presents the Communists in a way too positive light, omiting the armoured Nationalist forces equipped by the Americans and how those same Americans pushed them in front of the Japanese onslaught in Operation Ichi-Go. There is also nothing about the Nationalist parachute forces created in 1944 - again, space. But the overall product is positive, even if it is just a primer.

The author published the second book covering the 1937-45 timeline, but by shoving the Civil War into it the book was squandered with uniform fluff and repetition. The third book is about the Warlord armies from 1911-1930, that gives a more manageable subject-to-space ratio, which can be augmented by a larger 260-page book *""The Armies of Warlord China 1911-1928""* that is also a good reference; Philip Jowett also wrote *""China's Wars: Rousing the Dragon 1894-1949""* with a larger 400 pages.",Chinese Civil War Armies 1911–49 (My review),1606245245

A. Read both at the same time

books,"In 1959, Robert Heinlein wrote the classic Starship Troopers, a story set in the fictional Federation Terra (*Terra* means Earth in Latin languages) and its new society is a libertarian power fantasy, with the quality of life being as high as it can possibly be, the State is minimum and the military is minuscule, only 1% of the population. The voting franchise is earned through military service (combat and non-combat) and everybody is allowed to apply in order to become a citizen (as long as they endure the grueling service time). The Terran Federation is opposed by the communist-like Arachnids (the ""Bugs"") and has an ambivalent relation with the Skinnies (that provide a window of understanding with the bugs).

Maligned mainly by leftists as a fascist ""pronunciamento"", this argument is very weak and is not supported under the light of the actual narrative (even if we use the movie as a basis).

books,"I'm not sure how to title this, nor how do explain it but I'll do my best. I read Ready Player One awhile back, and really enjoyed it. I bought Ready Player Two today, and I'm excited to read it.

Although, I decided to read some reviews of the first book. A lot of people didn't like it for particular, reoccurring reasons. The reasons aren't important, what is, is that I myself don't ever think about any of these things when I read, and I'd like to. 

I don't recognize when characters don't develop (or do so badly), when the plot is poor, sometimes I recognize a few things but nothing deeper.

books,"Hey, I stumbled across this website recently. I don't know how I found it since finding stuff like this on Google can be a *pain*. It looks like the site is promoting a new fantasy romance series? So far, I see only one book which I assume is the first one. It comes out this December.

Plot reads:  

&gt;A Magical Woman Meets a Modern Dragon...  
&gt;  
&gt;Kayli Zarell, daughter of Zarek and Nemony, was attending her grandmother's funeral when an unexplainable vortex pulls her and her family into sleepy small town Blue Ridge, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Romulus Travers, resident dragon of Blue Ridge, finds his day interrupted when the same vortex leaves destruction throughout the town. The Travers' open their home to the Zarell's as both families come to terms with the chaotic nature of their new circumstances.  
&gt;  
&gt;One Crazy Proposal Later  
&gt;  
&gt;What seems to be the worst thing to come out of this situation is Rom's and Kayli's immediate attraction to each other. Rom has his responsibilities in Blue Ridge. Kayli and her family have lived in isolation away from human civilization. Not to mention, if a relationship were possible, it would require a great deal of magic to travel between both worlds. These realizations don't stop them, however, and the next thing they know, they are affianced the same day they met.  
&gt;  
&gt;After the proposal, all kinds of trouble seems to be heading the Travers' way. The other town residents are upset by the damages to their homes and businesses - some begin thinking the Zarell's are to blame. Then there are things like kidnapping, past trauma, plots of domination, and murder that threaten to fracture everything the Travers' have built. But maybe, just maybe, a rushed proposal under the stars is exactly the kind of crazy that is needed if the Zarell's and Travers' are to survive.
