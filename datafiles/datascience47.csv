So it is possible to run Spark on Kubernetes. I recently saw a talk from Spark summit 2017 where they showed how they implemented HDFS and Spark completely in Kubernetes.

Hey all! I’m a bit lost here with regards to my next step. For some context, I studied a social science at a good school, and the most I was exposed to was R, Excel, HTML/CSS. I am two years out of undergrad and decided I want a career change because my current job prospects look pretty bleak. I’d also appreciate making more money than what I’m currently making.

In addition, I am a conflict avoider so I probably won’t fare well in a legal environment. I quit my job (willingly unemployed here) and have been doing some research. After also contemplating my past, I learned that I was obsessed with my statistics course in university but chose to not pursue statistics due to fear of failure. This past couple of days have consisted of crazy amounts of research to find resources/boot camps/LinkedIn connections to help me make the best decision for myself. Right now, I’m considering the Springboard Data Analytics Career Track, a 6 month program with a job guarantee. However, I’m dreaming big here and also considering the Turing School Front-End Developer Track (not analytics, but here’s hoping some of y’all may know something about it). I am in an ok financial position to spend 9 months studying full time and am a very fast learner. I know I can get through either program, but I am more concerned about spending money and not landing a job. For those who have completed either program or know of people who have, which one would y’all recommend? Will I have good job prospects even without a non STEM or Art BA?

Background:  I started a job as a Data Analyst at a large health company recently.  I have a life sciences PhD (pure wet-lab), and while I'm good with Python and have some experience with NLP and ML, I'm really not suited to the math and stats-heavy world of a pure ML job.    I'm hoping to find my niche and still climb that career ladder without moving into an area that's not well-suited for me.  I enjoy the research &amp; insights aspect of data science and the data engineering part, but I'm just never going to be your resident expert on linear algebra or Bayesian stats.

And I feel Tableau is limited very much in their ability to create calculations with deep context.

datascience,"Hi everyone,

Just mulling over some thoughts. I have a few years experience as a data analyst in the UK (very much junior) and while I know being junior a lot of grunt work comes with the territory, I find myself very frustrated with the nature of the job being so detail orientated.

Don't get me wrong, I can do the job, I actually enjoy the maths, I just don't like the constant cross-checking, validating, formatting. I feel like 80+% of the job is in the detail. It drives me insane. What I also find equally frustrating is feeling a bit like a satellite, not quite part of the action, so to speak. Often times, my analysis supports some ongoing project for product, or marketing etc, and I don't get a say in direction of the project. Data feels like it's just opportunity spotting, not really dictating strategy. I'm looking ahead and I don't actually like what my manager does. It seems he does not have much of a voice in the organisation. Everywhere it's always been sales led, product led, marketing led. This has been true across all of the companies I've been at.

Having said this, I do acknowledge that the job market for data is only heating up, and the compensation is reflected, (even in the UK!). All jobs come with its cons but a part of me feels like I would be silly to walk away from a good career track and (relatively) good money, particularly when everyone and his grandma is trying to get in.

I am currently exploring other areas in tech such as product management and UX but I'm not 100% sure they'll be better than my current line of work.
