datascience,"Hi all I’m a recent bs grad, job searching for a data analytics/science position in New York. But I’ve been having trouble looking for one. Virus thing doesn’t help but gives me time I guess.

Background:
Industrial engineering w minor in econs 
Wasn’t mature enough for college so I scraped through
Now I wanna do something about it.
I know basic sql, r, tableau, excel and now working on python. 
Took 1 C course during a sem in college. 
Never had a data internship (it’s all a ripple effect) have been close to getting a job twice out of hundreds of applications, but that I know is due to my incompetence in the subject matter. 

Currently I have been trying to do some home studying to better my beginner understanding in the subject by doing the codeacademy data science course and working on a textbook called thinking in python 2e. 

Hence, I’m looking for a mentor/meetups in the city that could help guide me and teach me the foundation of learning the subject and gaining my own independence as well as learning to equip myself with the necessary knowledge and strategies on nailing job interviews within this industry.

Thank you for listening, I don’t expect anything but I just thought Id take the fullest opportunity that reddit has to offer as a positive platform for good and for expressing my thoughts.

I'm not really sure how to build and structure my education plan. The math minor will definitely help me on either ""path""/area. What is the general consensus: is it easier to self-study software engineering principles later on and get a related job that way, or is focusing on that in uni and later on self-studying data science and stats principles easier? My initial guess is that it would be better for me to take the data science + math combo in uni and later on learn about swe/developer ""stuff"", but maybe I'm wrong here?

Now a lot of users start an application on a daily basis (about 30k) but not all of them submit the application; they are just stuck/dropped off somewhere on the app. This is called a 'draft'. Our startup only has a few agents (around 20) who call these potential customers (Stuck/dropped off from the app) and hence a lot of potential customers are left who could've given us good business.

Hello,

First post on a subject such as this, so please guide me to a different place if needed. I have a situation I could really use some suggestions with. I graduated college with my degree in management information systems and now I got a job as a data intern. I do not have anyone in my company to teach me as i am the first data position this company has had.

What the company does now:

Has forms which internal clients request a job on. These forms store data in SharePoint list data. On the employee side they can continue the form to add other information needed. I have not created a data model yet but I think I may make a relational data model to help with solutions. Right now there is a JobID and a whole bunch of attributes as the data is very flat. An employee has an automatically updating excel file with this data but it takes 40 min to update and it is so impractical to work with due to how unorganized and slow it is.

What I have been thinking:

Set up an azure SQL database and use flows to move the data from SharePoint into SQL and then from there into powerBI. This way I can query useful data way quicker. However the data is still very flat and unstructured and I have not done this before so I am trying to learn. I am looking for suggestions on some sort of data pipeline. I was told the data must stay in SharePoint but I can move it from there. For reference the excel file that is being used has 120,000 cells. I know this isn't that many comparatively but for how unstructured this system is it is very difficult to deal with.",Data help please!,1585008620

The specific challenge: AI apps are desperately needed to mine treatment and prevention insights from a database of 29,000 scholarly articles on coronavirus, according to Kaggle, the data association leading the effort.

That database — recently collated by leading research organizations and the Trump Administration — offers a wealth of information on coronavirus.

With the right AI tools, all that data and all those insights could be quickly mined by doctors, scientists and medical pros looking to beat back the virus.

Fortunately, some AI-generated writing tools already exist to make that job easier.

SDL, for example, already has a text summarizer that uses AI to auto-create summaries of lengthy documents.

With SDL’s tool, users simply drop in a lengthy document, and SDL Content Assistant will generate a summary of their text.

Meanwhile, academic publisher Springer Nature has prototype software capable of producing a draft academic book by quickly sifting through hundreds of academic papers.",SOS: AI Help Needed to Defeat Coronavirus,1584961829
datascience,"Hello community,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm building DataGrab, a web scraping service that aims to make data extraction easy (but still flexible) from a variety of web pages.

I just got out a first working version; it's on: [https://datagrab.io](https://datagrab.io)

I'm looking for beta testers (whom I prefer to call collaborators) willing use it in some real-world scenarios. It's completely free at this point; all I'm asking for in exchange is detailed feedback so I could make it better.

The app currently has the following features:

* Visual job setup (no coding needed)
* Two field types: text and date/time
* Pagination
* Incremental scraping (extracting only new data on each run, e.g. new reviews of a product, new comments on a post)
* Scheduling
* Export in CSV, Excel or JSON formats
* Automatic data delivery via email
* Data preview before submitting the job

Sounds good? Sign up and give it a shot!

datascience,"I'm trying to build a **simple book recommendation system**, where I don't have any kind of ratings (no comments, no likes, no 1-5 stars, ...).

The information I can use is the following:

* **Book metadata**  :  title, author, published date, model (printed or ebook), genres (one or more).
* **Username**.
* **Type** : category of interaction made by a user, it can be '*order*' (if the user ordered the book) or '*access*' (if the user just checked the book).
* **Number** : if '*type*' = '*access*' then this parameter indicates the number of times the user accessed the book.

So I have a DataFrame that looks something like this:

|number|type|username|product|model|price|publishing\_dt|genres|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|6|access|kerrigan|2345|printedbook|12.99|2020-02-01|fantasy, kids, family|

|1|order|kerrigan|86833|ebook|5.60|2020-02-04|action, war|

My goal is to **develop a KNN system** to make book recommendations and I can have two types of classifications:

1. **Item-based** : similarity between books (by genre and author).
2. **User-based** : similarity between users. Take each user purchases and compare them to other users to find similarities so if *userA* bought *book1*, *book2* and *book3* and *userB* bought *book1*, *book2* and *book4* you can assume that *book3* is a good recommendation for *userB*.

But my doubt here is if I can develop a KNN system **combining** both technics, so depending on the data I input to it, it decides which solution is the better one.

Is this possible? Can someone point me in a good direction or send me some good tutorials?

This is a selection of maths courses, collections of courses, and specializations which are freely available online, and which can help achieve your data science mathematics goals. They have been separated into the broad topics of mathematical foundations, algebra, calculus, statistics &amp; probability, and those especially relevant to data science &amp; machine learning.

Take a look at the list and closer inspect those which may be of interest to you. I hope you find something useful.

 
Mathematical Foundations

These courses are intended to help lay the foundation for learning more advanced maths, as well as foster the development of mathematical thinking. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Introduction to Logic, Stanford (course)
This course is an introduction to Logic from a computational perspective. It shows how to encode information in the form of logical sentences; it shows how to reason with information in this form; and it provides an overview of logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, Stanford (course)
Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

High School Mathematics, MIT (collection of courses)
In this section we have provided a collection of mathematics courses and resources from across MIT. Some are materials that were used to teach MIT undergraduates, while others were designed specifically for high school students.

Statistics &amp; Probability

Statistics and probability are the foundations of data science, more so than any other family of mathematical concepts. These courses will help prepare you to look at data through the statistical lens and with a critical probabilistic eye. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Statistics and probability, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers analyzing categorical data, displaying and comparing quantitative data, summarizing quantitative data, modeling data distributions, exploring bivariate numerical data, study design, probability, counting, permutations, and combinations, random variables, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, two-sample inference for the difference between groups, inference for categorical data, advanced regression, analysis of variance

Fundamentals of Statistics, MIT (course)
Statistics is the science of turning data into insights and ultimately decisions. Behind recent advances in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence are fundamental statistical principles. The purpose of this class is to develop and understand these core ideas on firm mathematical grounds starting from the construction of estimators and tests, as well as an analysis of their asymptotic performance

Data Science: Probability, Harvard (course)
We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance.

Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data, MIT (course)
The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including: multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions, laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)

Improving your statistical inferences, Eindhoven University of Technology (course)
First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following Open Science principles.

Introduction to Probability and Data, Duke University (course)
This course introduces you to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes' rule. You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.
