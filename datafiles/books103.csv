books,"I remember a few years back there was a lot of sniffiness around new editions of *Wuthering Heights* that had [Twilight-style covers](https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=30839238233&amp;searchurl=spo%3D150%26sortby%3D17%26kn%3D%2593Wuthering%2Bheights%2594%26p%3D6%26sp%3D1&amp;cm_sp=snippet-_-srp6-_-title30) (and, in some cases, “Bella and Edward’s favourite book” on the front). The gist of this sniffiness (which I was at least passively in agreement with at the time) was that it was just *terrible* that people would only pick up a classic now if they were guided by a modern, popular novel about vampires. (There were also more considered criticisms about whether these modern repackagings missed the point of *Wuthering Heights*, as well as people who thought that it was a good thing for youngsters to be picking up a classic, whatever the reason.)

Well, from all the way back in 1965, that golden era when people were well educated and knew their classics, we have... popular author Somerset Maugham “presenting“ *Wuthering Heights*! There was a whole range of these, including Somerset Maugham presenting Dickens, Dostoevsky, and Fielding. 

I’m being slightly facetious with this comparison, of course. Clearly, there are differences between a tie-in linked to a specific book that happens to be featured in *Twilight* and a diverse range of classics curated by a popular author. Also, Somerset Maugham had a long, celebrated career behind him by the 1960s.

But I do find it interesting that, even in the 1960s, a publisher was trying to sell classics by splashing the name of a popular contemporary author over the cover and spine. I also find it odd that they went with such obvious, popular classics—surely it would’ve been better to use Maugham‘s reputation to give a boost to some more obscure older books? More obscure than Dickens, anyway.

Anyway, does anyone know if this sort of thing was common back then? Or was the “Somerset Maugham presents...” series just a one-off oddity?","Apparently there was a time in publishing history when classic novels would be “presented” by modern, popular authors (or: why I owe Bella and Edward an apology)",1622330011

books,"The societal mockery of genre fiction is given fuel by the respective community of these books. This community promotes people who are often overweight, strange, socially awkward, and sexually repressed (as shown in their own writing) as the vanguards of fiction.   

I am a fan of genre fiction, but the modern day authorship seems insistent on proliferating an image of the ""outcast"" as the central figurehead of the community. 

Authorship is not the domain of outcasts, it was a place where the most charismatic and interesting people resided. People like Lord Byron, Dunsany, Peake, Wordsworth, Hemmingway, T.S. Elliot, Fitzgerald, Twain, Poe, Alexander Pope, Dickens, Oscar Wilde, Nathanial Hawthorne, and even Moorcock. They were respected members of their community, even if they were at times a bit eccentric. 

That is not even to glance upon the remarkable women like Murasaki Shikibu, Virginia Woolf, and Mary Shelly who came from writing now replaced by the likes of V.E Schwab, Clarissa Claire, Stephine Myers, JK. Rowling, and Sarah J. Maas.   

Writing was said to be produced from those with the most creative and intelligent minds. Not from people with no personal skills and a vapid understanding of politics and religion. 

Correlation does not prove causation and if these people wrote good genre fiction I would not complain, but evidently they do not. Even if you love their books they do not write well. Tolstoy was an anti-war author, today we consider GRRM to be anti-war. Strangely enough the latter (who is another awkward old man uncomfortable with sexuality) does not have the barest grasp on the subject. When questioned he said war is ok only when justified (this is a completely meaningless statement and reveals the shallowness of the central theme in ASOIAF).  

Authors like Brent Weeks and Jim Butcher are actively uncomfortable engaging with people in interviews and onstage; they even fail to dress with any propriety for public events. The perception of genre fiction is well earned and we have only ourselves to blame. 

The reason society has no respect for genre-fiction is because genre-fiction has no respect for itself. Writing quality, depth, historical significance, atmosphere, etc. is all thrown away in favor of pity fan service and instant gratification. The fandom actively despises talent and derides it with terms like ""pretentious"", or ""elitist"". 

We should expect good writing. Those who are skilled in literature should be skilled in life, not holed away, defensive, and prone to childish sexuality that is normalized among the fanbase. Science is the industry that was most known for people evasive to social norms but that is because of the nature of their work. Writing is based on understanding people and history, and that translates to a better understanding the world. 

How can I expect people like Schwab, Rothfuss, or Erikson to have any depth as a writer if they have no insight into politics, culture, or history in the real world? I understand the predilection of pop-fiction to be escapist, but if you want escapism go by a pond and start skipping rocks. Reading is for intellectual pursuit, and the type of authors genre fiction proliferates makes it impossible for this incredible artform to be of any value to society and relegates it to mockery and scorn.",Why are modern authors (specifically fantasy) so awkward/socially inept,1622327389

I have always had an interest in astronomy, and I had a pretty general knowledge of Galileo's accomplishments. That being said, this book corrects the common misconception that Galileo's research was driven by antagonism for the Catholic Church. In reality, Galileo thought that philosopher's (like Aristotle) could not provide true understandings of nature; he thought that only science of measurement and observation could reveal the laws of nature. Galileo was a fairly devout catholic, and the Church didn't take any action against him until many of the philosophers dragged the bible into the debate.","The ""Very Short Introduction"" series is such a great way to deepen your understanding of a topic in relatively little time.",1622325599

books,"A few years ago I received two books to read by the author Ray Jay Perreault.
I was writing reviews for a site (no payment involved) and his work came to my hands.
The Book Title, ""VIRUS 72 hours to live""
Yes, I know it is not exactly the newest topic to write about, but chatting sci-fi and fantasy, there is not a lot of room for creativity in general. 
And do not crucify me.
I write fantasy and every genre has special characteristics and it doesn't mean it makes it less remarkable. It's something like a mystery/police work without a murder or a romance without a love story. That said, the game in sci-fi is how you develop the story because that's where the author can show how good he is. Ray Jay Perreault does it well.
VIRUS is a story that makes me tremble nowadays.
It is not a prophecy or a vision, but it is funny how it intersects with Elon Musk's plans of establishing a colony on Mars and sun-powered space crafts.
I am an avid reader and I can read anything if it doesn't have rape or child abuse. 
Those days I was having lots of fun reviewing for indie authors and Ray Jay Perreault fell in my hands together with many others, some of them very good.
Going through a worldwide virus infection that kills so many, it was inevitable VIRUS would come to my mind.

books,"So, I really enjoy books that read like a documentary film, but may not necessarily be non-fiction. Some books that are sort of historical recounts of an event through someone's narration are fun to read, but I also like that with fiction. I'm not big on romance, or horror, or huge elaborate plots where you have to decipher what's happening throughout. I just like books that narrate something either real or theoretical that are very interesting, again, sort of like a documentary series on Netflix.

Is there a name for this genre of book? One of my favorites I've ever read was Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer, which I know is based on a real excursion of Everest. But even if it weren't real, and were based on Science Fiction or something from a historical period, it's that style of book where you're reading it from the author's perspective and following them along their journey.

books,"I have no idea what the current consensus is on this book but I definitely did not enjoy it as much as the acclaim section at the beginning of the book did. It was not electrifying or breakneck or any other adjectives used to describe it for me.

The things I really liked were, however. I could not put down any of the chapters about the mercenary. He was so delusional and his thoughts and opinions were so precise and gave him such character that I just waited for him to break into some new persons house to give his review of their lives. He kinda unravelled and becomes a goober by the end and is then dumped quickly with dialogue confirming how meaningless he is compared to his self-aggrandizing opinions on himself and his origins and how he thinks the people he works with see him. 

I also like how Dean Koontz writes his villains experience of dying. I don't know if he does it in every book, but the novel by him that got me interested in reading this also had a wild death description that I found very fitting of each character and quite artistically poetic and even descriptively beautiful.

The things I didn't like are as a result of this last book that I read by him. I absolutely loved *Intensity* it quickly became my favourite book and I polished it off in like 2 or 3 days after not finishing a new book for months. I also like the killers opinions on things in that but the tense atmosphere for the protagonist filled every crevice of the rest of the chapters which weren't from the killers perspective. This is not the case in *The Good Guy*. Since it's a thriller and not a horror, the main character was always too easily successful at escaping the mercenary and it slowed the tenseness of chases.

I also did not find the two main leads very interesting. This was the part that felt the most dated and I had to force myself to slog through it. The main guy has no personality beyond being brave and taking risks to save 'girl'. And the woman is not as deep as she thinks she is. I also didn't like how quick and out of nowhere they started vibing with each other, like it was just meant to happen, no slow build up. They just immediately are flirty with each other. It's like an 80s action-crime thriller flick starring an everyman like Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford in book form.

Finally, it might be because I'm not American and don't have a patriotic bone in my body but the reveal that the main guy is ex-Marine was very boring and I saw it coming (maybe I was meant to? Not sure). It gets too ""American"" once this is revealed and starts going on about how the character ""is not currently at home but he feels so at home from seas to shining sea"". I was imagining him saluting the setting sun with an American flag flapping from the gazebo behind him at this point and rolling my eyes. Government conspiracy and political/military nonsense just isn't my thing. I wish he was just an average stone mason with a sense of justice. Would have been better.

Recently I came back. I'm hoping I've grown a bit - and I can enjoy literature with a new set of eyes. I've never been a fan of ""page-turners"". All I want is to feel, to think, and to enjoy the language. And it looks like sci-fi can provide all of that.

I don't know if this will help everyone, but if you're like me and struggle with coming up with the right words for a topic, I just found out you can hire people to write your book or even an ebook for you.

And the best part is they are usually affordable and really good. You can even claim the writings as your own after you pay them!!

books,"It could he about the stories themselves or even the book industry. For me its a combination of both where fantasy is still at an all time high in popularity and we get magical elements in the real world. The problem is there is little world building, magic simply exists and we are supposed to accept our world is the same as in the story but there's just Magic. I can think of a lot of things changing of we experienced fantasy elements while going to my 9 to 5. But the industry keeps pushing books like this out cuz they sell big time.

books,"I’m just writing this down to see if how I interpreted the book was the same as others.

So Glen suggests that by fasting and walking to Vegas they are essentially purging themselves and super charging themselves with “white magic”. In my head this is what is siphoning away Flagg’s power, and making him able to miss things with his visions.

The reason they make the trek is so that at the execution all the people who follow Flagg are gathered together. 

The fireball made by Flagg was uncontrolled when he was distracted, and “the hand of god” or what I prefer to think was that it was Larry’s latent psychic abilities/ white magic, was able to control. Glen hypothesises (presumably this is King explaining the plot) that everyone is a bit psychic/has the shining.

books,"I read and add books to my TBR very randomly. Therefore, I had zero idea that it was probably the author's last book and an autobiography/a suicide note of sorts (as I've understood from a couple of analysis I read after I completed the book). Even though the book was relatively short, it took me 10 days to finish it. And even after finishing it, I don't feel the impact? I sympathize with Yozo, but the narration was so utterly confusing that I had to re read pages again and again to make sense of what's happening. And I feel more terrible after realising that it's one of the best works ever in Japan! What am I missing?? I really appreciate and am intrigued by works that are dismal and dark (by this I mean the likes of Almost Transparent Blue by Ryū Murakami), thus the theme being not my cup of tea seems improbable. I really really don't want to miss out on something as great as No Longer Human has been made out to be.
Also, it does come to me as a shock post reading that this was all not a work of fiction to bits, so I might read it again now after reading more about Osamu Dazai's life and death; maybe reading it with more perspective will help.",I just finished reading Osamu Dazai's No Longer Human and I'm quite confused,1622301443
books,"To get a better idea of a particular language's canonical literary figures I often browse the websites of the aforementioned editorial collections. However, I can't seem to find such editorial collections, which compile the major works of canonical authors, for other countries' literatures. I know the works of Spanish authors are published by Ediciones Cátedra (although not to the degree of the Library of America or the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade) but apart from that I can't seem to identify other, relatively complete and established editorial collections of other countries' literatures. Of course there are many classics series such as the Penguin Classics and the Oxford World's Classics but those are pretty general and rarely publish works of writers who are not **absolutely** essential to a countries literary canon. If anyone knows any such editorial collections (they don't have to be English) and is willing to share them, I'd by greatly appreciative.","American Literature has the Library of America, French the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, what about editorial collections of other countries' literatures?",1622301334

books,"All these popular series' have elaborate and detailed wikis that contain any information you might have forgotten, making it easier to read more casually and not pay attention to names or places. We sort of take this for granted, but think about all the times you've searched up a name when it appears in a book and you have no clue where they've appeared before, or who they even are.

Not so with older works. I'm reading ""The Forgotten Beasts of Eld"" by Patricia McKillip these days and this name showed up that I didn't remember being mentioned before. I then had the urge to google it, before realizing it would be fruitless - because there is no wiki or page regarding this book. I ended up skimming through the previous page, and it turned out the name did show up for the first time, but it was an alternate name for a dragon.

I usually read translated (to portuguese) works of literature, but I always had in the back of my head that there's probably value in the books that's inevitably lost in translation. The question that I pose is the following, is there any book (preferably one the usually named ""classics"" in english literature) that you think are a must read in the original language?

books,"I remember reading a book called Tales of Old Japan by A.B. Mitford. I'm very interested in Japanese mythology and Asian culture (mostly China and Japan). However once I started reading that book I noticed one thing. **The text is so** ***small***. It was very hard to get through the book once I noticed that. The thing with books is that all of it is text. Which is something authors have to balance when writing them. I.E. Conveying information.

The books on Japanese mythology I have, they have very small text. How do you go through a book like that with this kind of physical copy? It's also something that frustrates me about my physical copy of Wheel of Time. I have the first book, The Eye of the World and it's a very small copy with very small text. It's not very wide, it's very short and very thick. I hate when books come out like that. (Wait, that's more than one topic I'm venting.)

This is one of the benefits of e-books and kindle is that you can change the size of the text. With physical copies you can't change that. It's especially hard when one part is one big paragraph with no breaks.

Keep in mind I didn't find these books in the library, my family bought them for me. (This was a long time ago before I became an adult and got money.) So I can't return them (though I might be to trade them I think? I have Aspergers and I'm figuring out independence). I was thinking of getting a digital version of these books, but I already have them bought so it might be a waste of money.

Keep in mind, I have glasses so it's not like reading is a problem for me. Maybe it's a pet peeve, maybe it's because reading books with small text is chore? I don't know.

books,"Okay, so I'm reading ""Name of the wind"" by Patrick Rothfuss, figured for 18k reviews on Amazon and keeping a 4.7 rating would mean it's a decent book. Other authors seem to like it, etc. 

The main character is just too good at everything though, he's too smart, physical, talented, strong, attractive.  He's not just smart, he's brilliant; he learns everything instantly. He learned to play the lute or whatever instrument it was before his hands were big enough to reach an the strings.

What is the point of that? I can't relate to a character who has the innate ability to be perfect. I don't find them interesting or see the merit in following their story. I mean, I know Frodo would succeed but it was against all odds, he wasn't the world's smartest, fastest, most skilled fighter without virtually any effort. 

My favorite stories are ones about people totally unprepared for their storyline and have to put in actual effort to succeed. Not someone who has the natural ability to succeed at everything and for being so smart makes such dumb choices.

Recently I came off my Terry Pratchett binge and wanted to read something really powerful. It's difficult to explain, but the best way I could put it is by using The Screwtap Letters by C. S.

I saw this as a problem I had to fix, so I thought why not use novels to challenge myself? Its crazy... and I kind of begin to see improvements. Little by little, I'm sure I'll get better at this. So let me explain what was going through my head.  Its pretty simple.

So I used novels that I find interesting to try and help myself practice with focusing.
