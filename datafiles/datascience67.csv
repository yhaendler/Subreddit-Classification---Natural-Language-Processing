Hi all, 

I am interested in developing or changing my career path for data scientist. I spent an entire month to complete machine learning and deep learning specialization (by Andrew Ng). I do have my small- medium size project to try applying ML in my company with Python programming as well.

I think I will use sometimes to read through those Andrew's material again. While doing my small project I am looking forward to next path I should take. I.e.

1) Learn more on tenserflow and Keras
2) Learn new language (i.e. R, SQL, PowerBI)
3) Finding more complicated exercise or assignment

datascience,"When I read through the comment sections of posts on this subreddit asking about career advice and the process of breaking into the field, I've noticed a few recurring recommendations:

1. Have a referral
2. Have experience
3. Have a relevant graduate degree

I feel quite angsty.

In order to work on recommendation #1, I have to ""network"". This seems ostensibly easy, but when I try to break this down into actionables, it's super vague with no time-horizon. I think one of the biggest difficulties for me is that I feel insecure and self-serving asking people for their time, attention, and wisdom so that I can get a job and advance _my_ career. It just doesn't seem clear how I can reciprocate or be of service to _them_, and that makes me feel uncomfortable reaching out on Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.


Recommendation #2 is obviously a catch-22.

To work on recommendation #3, I need to go to grad school. In order to do that, I have to pay down some of the enormous amount of money I borrowed to pay for my undergrad. In order to do that, I need a high paying job. So, like recommendation #2, this is also a bit of a catch-22. This is particularly hard for me because I actually want to go to grad school (for non-professional reasons).

To break it down to specific questions:

1. How do you overcome the angst and insecurity that comes with looking for work in a highly competitive field.
2. Are there things I could offer the people I'm trying to network with so it's not just me hustling, and there's some reciprocity?
3. How can I evaluate the relative priority of working on my portfolio vs. cold applying vs. trying to network? For context, [here is the portfolio I have now](https://www.vivacious.dev/).

I'm sorry if this turned into a bit of venting session. I'm pretty confident other people share the experiences and questions I have, so I hope this post can benefit people beyond just me.",Some follow-up questions about recurring recommendations on this subreddit,1606688010

Probability Theory:
&gt;Includes a brief review of probability spaces and finite counting techniques, random variables and distribution functions, density, mass functions, and expectation. The course also examines the standard random variables; multivariate distributions; functions and sums of random variables; limit theorems - weak and strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Students should have a solid background in undergraduate mathematics through multivariable calculus, and some familiarity with theory and proof in mathematics. 

Applied Stats 2:
&gt;Topics include, but are not limited to, confidence intervals, regression analysis (multiple regression, logistic regression and regression with categorical predictors), analysis of variance (two-way, factorial design, repeated measures and mixed models), analysis of categorical variables (measures of association, chi-squared tests, odds ratio, relative risk, McNemar's test) and non-parametric tests.

datascience,"I work for an insurance company as a data analyst and recently my manager asked me to create an unrealistic model.  
I have been asked to create a model to predict a 'persona type' (e.g. single parent, struggling student) based on postcode demographics data. The marketing team has come up with several persona types using personal information and survey data, and my manager wants me to somehow use that info (which doesn't have a postcode) and link it with postcode demographics.  The idea of this model is to predict what persona type is visiting our website so we can adjust our targeted ad strategy. The issue is that marketing customer segmentation has been done using survey data that includes a lot of personal information. When someone visits our website and fills out the forms we don't get any of the personal information used in that marketing analysis (GDPR and all that). My manager asked to use postcode demographics data that which includes features like

* average household income;
* the percentage of households paying child benefits, mortgage, private rent
* The average private or social rent of the property, etc.

My issue with this is that there is no way to predict persona types using just the demographic features that are on a postcode level. He wants to use this model before we have gathered any application data with personal info about the customer. I have tried explaining that there is no way of predicting persona type using the information we get from the visit, but he thinks I am just being difficult and I should just get on with it and manually come up with rules where these personas might live using my intuition. I asked him how can we validate the results because this model relies on how well I decide which postcodes have which persona type but doesn't care about that.

- imbalanced datasets.
- and on anomaly detection (ie. severely imbalanced datasets).

We will be comparing the score performance of our classifier against other standard ML classifiers (for eg. logistic regression, naive bayes, random forests etc.)

Wanted to throw out a question I've been having for quite some time. Not sure if this sub is the exact right spot for it but it's my best guess. 

I am a third year Computer Science student looking to go into a career in Data Science, more specifically going for an ML Engineer position. I have already planned out transitioning into a Master's program that I can do alongside industry work after I graduate. 

My actual question is this: Is just getting a compsci degree and a Master's in AI and ML enough for me to work on developing medical AI and ML algorithms?

datascience,"Hi all, I noticed something of a trend of people here unable to break into the industry. I thought I'd share a recommendation for those based in the UK: apply for a degree apprenticeship in Data Science. You'll get a salary, a qualification, and a solid chunk of marketable experience.

There are many going, in various companies, including some big names. They don't have heavy entry requirements, just A-Levels or something to that extent. Even if you can't find any degree apprenticeship vacancies, you can go to the Institute for Apprentices website, and supply the information on it to a company of interest. You might be able to persuade them to take you on as a degree apprentice. Be persistent, network like a madman, and you will likely find a few companies who are at least happy to discuss possibilities. Lots of adults even up to mid thirties do these programmes, and the programmes are becoming more and more popular with employers.

Some fairly obvious issues: many of you have Bachelor's or even Master's already. You can do degree apprenticeships to a Master's level as well as Bachelor's. These apprenticeships are very practical and assess you based off your work projects. It will definitely be a different experience to typical academia, so there's no redundancy, just a smaller salary than you'd get as a junior data scientist, though it depends entirely on the company. You get 20% of your work time to put towards the degree, so if you already know a lot of the content you can spend it developing your own data science skills while still getting paid.

So, that's what a degree apprenticeship is, but why should you do it?
It instantly places you into the industry, into hands-on, relevant, applied experience for a prestigious company. No company wants an apprentice to sit around watching the experts do all the work without contribution. You'll get put to work as soon as you demonstrate the ability to do so and you'll be working alongside the junior data scientists, often as equals, and mentored by senior data scientists along the way. You'll have a bustling CV at the end of your first year, and if you finish the programme, the company, in all probability will take you on as an employee afterwards.


I can say with confidence if you are up to the task, you will leave with as much experience as a junior data scientist having undergone the same number of years as you did for the programme. 


I realize I've focused very much on the positive here. Obviously it's not an amazing salary and pays about 20k-23k annually, a lot lower than many data science roles.

I was messing with some linear regression and I noticed that  if I don't put the constant I get a much higher R2. The image explains the situation better than I can (https://imgur.com/N8JmEtV ). The data has daily revenue on the y axis and the day ranging from 0 to 600 on the x axis. I already removed some of the outliers from the data.

I already studied what linear regression and R2 is, but I don't understand what this could mean.

I don't think that I have a better model just because R2 is way higher in the second scenario, right?

Thank you.","Statsmodel OLS with and without constant, why uncentered R2 is much higher?",1606589475

datascience,"Currently reading Machine Learning Engineering by Andriy Burkov (well known for his One Hundred Page Machine Learning book), he mentions that “74-86%” of machine learning projects fail or don’t reach production and his first point as reasons is “Lack of Experienced Talent”. 

Paraphrasing, he says that in 2020 most organisations don’t know how to hire and that most of the talent are people who have completed a couple of online courses. He also mentions that experienced software engineers don’t have expertise in data handling or machine learning. 

So for current data science hirers and team leads, do his sentiments echo with your experience? It’ll be interesting as well if you could include city/country and industry sector you work in to get a better overview.

I learned in graduate coursework a few years ago, and now I want to review/get really good with multivariate regression and logistic, because those are what I remember the most. I'm an analyst, I'd like to do ML at work. But even if I don't, it's interesting enough to just do for fun.

datascience,"Hello,

I'm new to SNA and trying to learn as I go so apologies if the question is a bit basic.
Was doing a coursera MOOC on SNA and one of the assignments was about scraping two large YouTube channels for recommended videos and then seeing how many they both recommend. 
For interest and exercise, I decided to expand on this by scraping several more channels.

I want to visualise it with a layout that puts channels which recommend a higher number of common videos closer, and the fewer videos that two channels link to, the further apart they will be.

So if channel A and channel B both link to the same 3 videos,
Channel A and C link to 1, and channel B and C link to 2 common videos: A and B will be 1/3 the distance of A to C, B and C will be 1/2 the distance of A to C.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm graduating with my MS in Statistics next year from a respectable US university with about 1.5 years of Data Analyst experience pre-MS. I am currently interning with a (mid-size) tech startup (most people in tech / in general would not recognize its name) located in SF but that has offices all over the world. By the time I graduate, I will have interned with the company for \~ 1 year.

My manager has told me that I'm excelling at all of the requirements necessary for a full-time position and that the team is looking to hire more Data Scientists next year, with me as a natural pick since the company has liked my work thus far. Yet leadership has indicated that most (if not all) new engineering / DS talent is to be hired in non-US offices in order to ""contain costs"". That for the cost of paying me an SF salary, ""we can probably get 2-4 engineers / DS elsewhere"".

While I would be thrilled to be able to be a DS somewhere abroad (just for the life experience), my mentors think that this would be a mistake for my early career as a DS, especially if I intend to remain in the US longterm (which I do) due to the potential hit to my finances (would get paid \~30-60% less in USD in potential locations, despite decreased CoL, potentially unable to contribute to retirement accounts, etc.), less career mobility, and lower negotiating power in future positions. They advised me to stay in the US (preferably SF, Seattle or NY) to build my career before branching out elsewhere. Based on their advice, I'm torn between being willing to move abroad for the life experience vs. staying here in the US.

Though I have not gotten an official offer, given that I have \~7 months until graduation, do you think I start looking for another company? Or, do you think the experience of being a DS abroad is a unique experience that makes me a better DS going forward? How should I approach this?
