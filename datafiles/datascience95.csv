datascience,"Hi everyone,

The problem set I'm working with is such:

Given two data points:

* A data point of top three predicted values given an image of a vehicle. For example, it's a picture of Mercedes C Class, the top three results (without the prediction confidence %) are ranked in order as ""Mercedes C class"", ""Tesla Model 3"", ""Kia Amanti""
* A data point that holds the score that user gave to the image we used in the prediction model. For example, for the Mercedes C Class, the score given was 8/10

The dataset is clean (no score is greater than 10, and are in int format), but prediction model sometimes has 1 car predicted, 2 cars predicted, or three cars predicted depending on the CV (computer vision) model.

What I'm trying to build is a scatterplot where the X-Axis is the score of the car, and the Y-axis is the frequency the car was predicted. The points on the graph will represent each car.

In terms of data wrangling, it's straight forward, but I'm not sure how to 'average' out the score given the prediction. 

For example, if the CV model responded with only one car, I thought of giving that car an added score of 3. If there are two cars, then the first car gets a score of 3 and the second car gets a score of 2. If the model responded with three cars, then each car will get the score of 3, 2, 1 respectively. The reason for doing so is to give each car a share of the score to help examine user scoring behavior.

How would you approach this problem?

Here's an example of the data:

|img|car\_pred\_1|car\_pred\_2|car\_pred\_3|Score (out of 10)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|car\_img\_1.jpg|""Mercedes C Class""|""Tesla Model 3""|""Kia Amanti""|8|
|car\_img\_2.jpg|""Ferrari Enzo""|""Lamborghini Diablo""|na|9|
|car\_img\_3.jpg|""Blue Bird Vision""|na|na|4|","Given a ranked dataset, how to find the average weighted score of the ranked set for a scatterplot?",1618873528
datascience,"Stats: [link!](https://imgur.com/a/YkfgjCL)

Two years ago, with a newly minted masters degree in stats and 3 YOE of analytics experience under my belt, I landed my first DS job in a HCOL city after 104 applications: [link!](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/aohn8w/3_years_ago_i_discovered_data_science_this_sub/). At the time I was massively underpaid, but I had naively hoped that with my first DS job it would be a much easier landing that second job with the pay I deserve. As soon as I hit 6 months in, I started to apply elsewhere.

Two years later, I (and probably many other DS) realized the opposite, DS interviews are a crap shoot and expectations unrealistic. I didn’t let that get the best of me, and spent many weekdays/weekends prepping for interviews. I finally landed my second DS, with a 55k increase in salary. (130k base, 10% yearly bonus, 15k signing bonus.)

The Breakdown:

6 months into the new job, I started applying and unsurprisingly, not a lot of companies took me seriously. Both screens said I should wait for at least a year and then apply. I took that advice and, in a few months, started to get interviews! Unexpectedly, there was a serious increase in interview difficulty from my first job. I had naively thought just having a DS job is enough for other employers. I was asked leetcode, programming, theoretical, database, statistical, ML and product questions. The range was baffling, and I bombed them left and right.

After hitting one year (and an extended winter break) I decided to start applying again. This time, COVID hit, and I had half the response rate from pre-covid. Many places e-mailed me letting me know that they were on hiring freezes (and later on, found out that there were many layoffs.) I had a few screens but the number of people applying for jobs was in the hundreds and employers were able to be picky. I ended up using this time to start seriously prepping for interviews: doing leetcode, refreshing my stats knowledge, reading up about databases, and picking up a few good software engineering fundamentals. 

18 months into my job and with an economy that was starting to recover, I started applying again. This time I got 15 HR screens from 70 apps. I knew my next step wanted to be at a tech company with an established DS team doing more ML engineering type work, and with the market seemingly picking up I declined to proceed with 8 roles after the HR/manager screen. I ended up with 5 technical screens, 5 2nd/3rd/4th rounds, and ended up with 2 offers.

My Takeaways:

• You don’t need to be a unicorn. However, refusing to adapt will make your job search a lot harder. I came from a stats background, and noticed DS is becoming much more coding and software engineering heavy. Companies no longer want to hold the hands of pure modelers (unless you’re an expert.) The opposite also applies, software engineers without good business sense/analytics/stats skills will create messes.
• As an addition to the above, being a Python expert will open up more doors than being an R expert. Out of all my interviews, only 2 or 3 wanted someone who knew R
• If you’re not at an intermediate/expert level of SQL, practice
• Technical skills are only half of the battle. Being a great communicator and having industry knowledge are huge. For my two offers, I felt like I was OK on the technical portions, but in both I received feedback that I was a great communicator and liked my enthusiasm for the industry","Two years ago, I wrote a post on r/datascience on the stats and experiences on landing my first DS job.

datascience,"Hey all,

I have a masters in tax and a CPA license and I've been at a big accounting firm for several years.

I mostly do data analytics work, dealing with ugly excel spreadsheets and extract files, doing ETL / data cleansing, and building out rule-based automation and dashboarding (Alteryx, Power Bi, Tableau, etc.).  

I like playing with Python and I have experience with pandas, plotly, matplotlib, basic web scraping, automation, etc., but pretty limited experience with ML. Nobody does ML in the tax accounting space as far as I can tell. I honestly get excited when I have a reason to use RegEx or connect to a database.

I want to expand my skills and apply them in a more meaningful way, but I'm struggling to figure out a coherent career path. I have experience managing small teams and working with business-side people to scope and deliver analytics projects, but I feel like I have some big knowledge and experience gaps that make me uncomfortable calling myself a data scientist. 

I've been trying to put in more effort to upskilling outside of work lately, but I'm having trouble conceptualizing what my future career looks like.

Should I focus heavily on learning ML and consider starting from scratch in entry-level data scientist roles? Or should I be looking more into the project management side of things and stressing less about learning to calculate derivatives to understand gradient descent better?

datascience,"I have been reading more about the theoretical backgrounds of neural networks (e.g. ""universal approximation theorem"") and have seen several authors demonstrate that even a simple (few layers, many neurons) neural network can (theoretically) approximate the variable of interest (i.e. the response variable) to a ""decent"" level of precision.  However, the implication being that to use simple neural networks in order to achieve good results, this would require a very large number of neurons. Therefore, deeper neural networks have been developed over the years, which attempt to provide good results with more layers but a fewer number of neurons.

This brings me to my situation: I have never been able to successfully fit a neural network to any real-world data that I have used. I have always gotten really bad results with neural networks (after trying all sorts of combinations of number of neurons, number of layers, learning rate, activation function, ""drop out"" regularization, etc.). This seems to be a hyperparameter-grid search problem.

(Ironically, models like CART decision trees have good results on the same data (supervised binary classification) and random forest has produced even better - this data is not ""small by any means"", contains around 30 columns and over 300,000 rows of data).

 Does anyone know if routines have been written (e.g. in tensorflow keras) that can assist in this problem of deciding the number of layers and the number of neurons? Is there a ""ground rule"" for deciding how many layers and how many neurons to begin with? Is there something around that can ""intelligently"" point you in the right direction for how many neurons/layers to choose?",Effective ways of choosing number of neurons/layers in a neural network?,1618866445

datascience,"Hey y’all!

I’m a university student currently participating in a DS competition which involves writing a report and conducting a 30 minute presentation. I’m a little nervous to be frank since there is a lot on the line: if me and my team place well, we will receive a cash prize as well as present our findings to irl banks. The report has already been turned in, and in a few days we will be presenting. I wanted to hear your experiences and any tips you may have related to individual/ group presentations.

Context: Each team was tasked with developing two ML models (logistic regression and random forest/ gradient boost/ feedforward neural networks) that will help predict whether a credit card applicant would turn delinquent and/ or default in order to determine if their application should be accepted. Our presentation needs to show what steps we took to develop the model, which model from the two we chose we believe should be used by the bank, and how the model could be used by the company. In the presentation, we are supposed to be acting basically like we are presenting to a real bank. Therefore, our audience are people that know a decent amount about credit services but very little about DS and ML.

Approach: The way I organized my presentation is by trying to answer the following questions in this order:
-	is ML an appropriate solution to the problem we were tasked with solving?
-	what domain knowledge was necessary for us to do our job well?
-	why did we choose our models (logistic regression and random forest) as opposed to the other models we could have chosen?
-	what are the key findings of our EDA?
-	how did we preprocess the data given?
-	in layman’s terms, how do the ML models we developed work? 
-	how did the models we build compared to each other?
-	what did our chosen model (random forest) choose as important/ non-important features?
-	how would we implement/ deploy our model?

In addition to these, I was thinking of hitting on basic things you hear a lot when talking about DS like the bias/variance tradeoff, overfitting and how to avoid it, collinearity of explanatory variables, etc.

Is there anything major you think I’m missing? Anything you have learned about interacting and presenting to businesspeople? Also, have you faced any challenges working with teams? I definitely have the most DS knowledge in my 4 person team and I want to make sure that they are all well prepared and have good understanding of these concepts so that we have a strong presentation.

I've found that the Kaggle forums, communities, and comment sections are quite inefficient for discussion. As a result, I'm happy to announce that I've created a state-of-the-art Kaggle Discord server to hopefully fix those issues by streamlining competition, dataset, and notebook discussions.

I've reached out to the Kaggle staff to see if an official Discord server could be created, but unfortunately, the staff have too much on their hands. Thus, this server will be unofficial. So you may be thinking, *""aren't there a bunch of these inactive Discord servers floating around?""* While that is true, we have over 480 people and counting with people asking questions. Let me just give you a quick rundown of some of the features I've added to this server:

* Unique roles or ranks like expert or novice with the same color of Kaggle
* Verified people from Kaggle sharing codes from Kaggle to help answer questions
* Resource, dataset, and notebook showcasing channels with people sharing like: [https://www.kaggle.com/brendan45774/how-to-get-the-lowest-score](https://www.kaggle.com/brendan45774/how-to-get-the-lowest-score)
* Team formation and discussion channels for competitions
* Channels for computing topics, similar to the Communities tab here on Kaggle

I've spent quite a long time setting this server up in hopes that a decent proportion of the Kaggle community will join and find it useful. The server will only be successful if the first people who join it are active and stay, so please do consider joining and sharing it with your friends and any other Kagglers you may know.

datascience,"There is no doubt that 2020 will represent a historical landmark in our recent memory. It instantly split into two: pre-pandemic and post-pandemic. And like any historical landmark, 2020 ushered in a great variety of seismic changes.  

Everything we knew about life went upside down: our goals, our ambitions, and priorities; our notions of work and good governance; the state of science and public knowledge; our relationship with the environment and so many other phenomena that we never heeded to in the ‘old normal’.  

And, of course, in the ‘new normal’, this political, psychological, and social upheaval has also had an impact on the economy. Consumer behavior has changed drastically as well, the lockdown and the chaos perhaps shaping in us a new sensibility of consumption. Everything from our habits, needs, preferences, to our buying patterns, has been reshaped by the pandemic.  

After scientists studying the novel coronavirus and its effects, data scientists are probably the most interested in what is to come. And businesses, like any other enterprise in 2021, will be eagerly waiting to cash in on what they will discover.  

So, what have they discovered? 

**Less is more** 

An economic disruption and uncertainty that rivalled 2008’s crisis and the fear of a sudden lockdown caused people to only consume what’s essential. According to a study by [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-123/Accenture-COVID19-Pulse-Survey-Research-PoV.pdf), 64% of the participants were worried about job security, while 38% were wary of the global economic impact. The caution was reflected in their spending habits, as they prioritized value instead of worth, saving generously. 

The newfound sensibility was also shaped by convenience and availability, given the sudden imposition of nationwide lockdowns. What’s further of note — perhaps unsurprising — is the type of essentials that we consumed such as canned food or soup. Let’s take a look:  

[**https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/consumer-markets/assets/cm-infographics-855-03.svg**](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/consumer-markets/assets/cm-infographics-855-03.svg) **(Source: PwC)**  

It is hard to say whether the new sensibility — which is great for the environment, though bad for businesses — will be cemented. Perhaps consumers will take their spending up a notch as the market gradually recovers.  

Until then, businesses can capitalize on the new habits to which consumers have taken. The consumption of entertainment, news, social media, music, art and books surged. We also observed a moderate rise in cooking and fitness. Clearly, people had the sudden urge to make a change: they wished to put the time to good use. Brands selling these goods have a great opportunity to take hold of their market. 

**Online thrives** 

Unsurprisingly, online markets thrived. Thanks to the lockdown, online businesses absolutely soared.  

Here's what we shopped online.  

[**https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/consumer-markets/assets/cm-infographics-855-04.svg**](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/consumer-markets/assets/cm-infographics-855-04.svg) **(Source: PwC)** 

However, data suggests that online markets would have soared in any case. According to [Accenture's](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-123/Accenture-COVID19-Pulse-Survey-Research-PoV.pdf) report, 64% of people were fearful for their health, while 82% were for others'. Incidentally, another [study](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/consumer-markets/library/covid-19-consumer-behavior-survey.html) reported that 49% avoided leaving their homes, while 57% decided to socially distance themselves even from their closest friends and relatives.  

Fear contained us. It also contained work, with the same study highlighting that 50% of the workforce worked from home, either partially or wholly. There simply was no reason to go out. And why would there be? Shopping online is far more convenient and safer.  

The warning is clear as day: go offline *and* online or miss out on a mammoth chunk of customers. For businesses already online, capitalize on the surge with attractive discounts and offers.  

And since most customers seem to be online, it is also time to work on your social media skills. Social media is quite easily the number one communication channel to reach your customers. It profoundly affects people’s perception of your brand, their opinion of your values, your identity. It has the power to influence people in swathes. Leverage it 

In fact, in 2021, consumers are suspicious of brands that do not have an online presence. It would seem bizarre that a business operates online but is not socially active.  

Besides, we don’t see any downside to not having an online presence. Customers love identifying with their favorite brand’s values, which are depicted via tweets, pictures, videos, and now stories or reels. Also, social media is arguably one of the best platforms to identify your ideal customer and target him or her with personalized ads and offers.  

**Hail the era of customer experience** 

If a term could define this era's business ethos it would be personalized customer experience. 

According to a [study](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/how-data-science-helps-shape-consumer-behavior-in-a-post-pandemic), over 86% of customers prefer paying more for a better customer experience. According to [another](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/articles/customer-expectations/?sfdc-redirect=369), more than 75% of customers expect their favorite brands to anticipate their needs and desires. It is no wonder that customer worshipping juggernauts such as Amazon and Netflix are so wildly successful.  

What fuels their success is two things: first, raw customer data and second, powerful [customer analytics solutions](https://www.sganalytics.com/data-management-analytics-services/customer-analytics-services/) that yield algorithms that anticipate their preferences.  

Their operation mimics the snowball effect — the more data they collect, the more strengthened the algorithms, and the more strengthened the algorithms, the more customers they attract, which results in more data collection, and on it goes.  

Other aspects that constitute an outstanding customer experience are personalized ads, timed ads, personalized offers, human-like chatbots and other communication avenues that help retain customers.  

There were also other drivers of change in consumer behavior. Besides convenience and availability, which we already mentioned, consumers also prioritized quality and hygiene. These factors literally caused them to switch brands. Take a look.

The key takeaway is to embrace data or perish. And the pandemic has only confirmed our conviction.  

The best strategy is a dynamic strategy, a strategy that constantly evolves. And such a strategy can only be made with data analytics, which takes measurable inputs and yields actionable outputs: Businesses that paid attention to these changes quickly altered their short-term strategy to minimize their losses, compared to businesses that didn't.  

As Google's Neil Hoyne [pointed out](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/marketing-future-data-analytics-changing/), ""the companies that are going to win are the ones who are using data, not guessing.""",Data Science After COVID-19: The Impact on Consumer Behavior,1618843602

The workflow is like this:

I have a series of binary files in a proprietary format on a redhat server. On this server is a c++ binary application that can decode this file into .csv format. I log into the linux machines, run this application on the binary files,  then copy these files over locally to a windows laptop and run a python-based data analysis. Putting python+analysis software on these linux servers is not an option. I have mounted the linux server's home directory as a mapped drive on my windows machine for easy copying of files. but I still have to log in to the linux host to run the binary decoder application. I want to automate the whole process where I can run a python script on my windows laptop and point it to a file (or folder) on the mapped linux drive, have it execute the decoder script remotely, then read in the csv files and perform the data analysis. 

The problem is that the decoder script is compiled in the native linux env, so it needs to be ran via its native environment. Is there an elegant way to execute a binary remotely on linux from windows?

**Me:**

* Early 30s, in a large city (not NYC, SF, LA)
* Data scientist for 6 years.   Currently a 'senior' data scientist.
* Resume looks like a' job hopper'?  I've had a fake DS job/bosses who want you to blatantly lie&amp;make things up/then moved across country/company going under / etc.  
* Not  a statistical ultra genius or elite coder or with niche in depth industry knowledge.  Just a hard working guy who figured out things through extensive trial and error.

**Current Spot:**

* Great coworkers , flexible deadlines.  
* Make **$128k**  with another 10% in other bonuses that are split &amp; paid semi-annually, but I don't start getting these for another 1-2 years away.
* No real opportunity for advancement. Been here 1.5 years. 
* Opportunity to become more familiar with cloud tech &amp; some deployment stuff which I need to get better at.  
* Turning into semi-fake DS job. Keep getting told to do very tedious and time consuming data reports.   Causes very long hours due to tedious nature of data reporting &amp; partially lack of motivation to do it.
* Pretty miserable due to point above.  People don't seem to care too much about the work either which makes me worse. ""  

**Opportunity**:

* Would give me , about $**140k base.**  Assuming I get 10% bonus &amp; the auto-vested 401k match I'd be pulling in about **$155k or $22-27**k more at least for next year**.**  I feel this is significant for someone of my experience / current level? Theres only so many jobs that pay $125k++? \~130-140k seems max salary for senior data scientist from non-elite companies in my city. 
* Would be **99%** remote.   
* Same job title and standard responsibilities.   Would have an equivalent peer of mine - who I know I'd make $9000 more than.  Rest is team or 3-5 reporting analysts.   
* Company is in an 'old school' industry / culture.   Data/tech infrastructure and culture are a bit behind but they say the they are aggressively moving forward.   

**Concerns**:

1. Thoughts on being remote all the time? I'm concerned once office life resumes being remote will be an issue career wise.
2. Not in an industry like Ecommerce/Marketing/Finance which I feel are more naturally suited for analytics.  This is more of lines of supply chain analytics.  Is this a good field for future?
3. Issue of joining an organization that is really early on in data science and limiting knowledge going forward where that is what new jobs will rely on?
4. Manager isn't a hands on data scientist or technical expert.  He is more traditional industry expert.  Not sure how I feel about that given possible inability for him to manage projects properly/set expectations.
5. Should I just continue looking and hope to find something else in a few months? This seems about max I'd be able to make if I switched?
6. Also what is standard success rate on interviews for everyone here?  I feel I get rejected by **90-95%+**  of interviews because I don't know some trivia stats questions, have experience in some niche thing, or god knows why.  I've always wondered if my 'job hopping' resume counts against me or I got worst luck with roles or am actually unqualified.

datascience," I am a Mechanical Engineer who has been learning DS and ML for the past 2 years. I work at a medium sized power plant.

I asked my boss if he was interested in implementing a DS project in the plant considering we have a large database for machine vibration data. He asked me to work on one turbine's displacement dataset (it would be a time series project) and try to see if I could predict  large vibrations or probably failure.

Is there any suggestions you guys could give me before tackling on this project by myself? What kind of neural network should I use? An LSTM network?

My boss is also a mechanical engineer, and no one in the plant will help me as they're busy themselves.",Suggestion for a Time Series work project,1618692213
datascience,I've been learning about Data Science and stuff for the past couple of months.

**Blog posts and articles:** I have also been reading some tutorials on Medium / Towards Data Science.

datascience,"My current employer (data science &amp; data engineering consultancy) is having a rough time. We have lost approx 40% of our consultants in 2021 alone, and the resignations don't seem to end. I'm fairly senior in consulting, but less so in data science. 

I would probably leave the company if it wasn't for personal reasons that prevent a job change at the moment, hence I do have some ideas of what I would want to change, but I can't speak for those 40% that already left. Next week my manager and one of the company's partner have called a meeting with me and some other remaining consultants to try and find out ""what's wrong?""

My question to /r/datascience - you who work/have worked in DS consulting, what were some things/perks that made you enjoy DS consulting? On top of my mind I was thinking about e.g. total compensation, types of projects, time spent on billable work vs. training vs. non-billable, types of clients, types of  managers/colleagues? Or if you have left DS consulting - what made you leave?

I appreciate any input!","Help, my employer is about to go under - what made you stay in / leave DS consulting?",1618683899
datascience,"I recently inherited a big mess of a code base from a defunct team in my company. I cherrypicked a small portion of the process flow for an initial release. Now I want to remove all the unused libraries (both standard and custom) to make the code base lean.

Is there any tools that will look at my main.py crawl through the code base and list all the packages that are used.

I am look for a deep tree, for example:
main.py
   —library.load1func
             —func2
                   —someotherfunc
And so on.

Is there any easy tools which will create this map for me? Too lazy to code this myself for a onetime use.

PS: just to clarify, say that ‘library.’ in the above example  has two function but my project uses only load1func, so I want only that name returned.

datascience,"Hi, would a data science degree be a good option? to eventually do computer science research or AI , planing on doing a masters after I graduate from my bachelors. There is also maths &amp; stats , physics , computing and it with some computer science related modules .Would the data science degree be the closest to a computer science degree from any of the others? They as well have have a joint computing &amp; IT and Mathematics degree (half math half computing.)  I understand data science degrees are quite new? p.s they have no CS degree sadly. I will provide data science course link below.

datascience,"In my current DS job I am free to experiment with models and my boss lets me do some R&amp;D. However, the production side is deficient: they use old tools, and very outdated pipelines and technologies. Most of the time we do ad hoc analyses for clients that require no production at all. I feel the need to grow my skills on production, and that's something I can't do where I am now.

That's why I'm looking for another job, even though I like my current company, boss and colleagues.

I was contacted for a new opportunity by a cool non-profit organization: they want to start a DS project that sounds very interesting to me (and useful for society IMHO), but there's one caveat: I'd be the first DS ever there. I would basically need to build everything from scratch, all by myself.

One one side, I could build a good career, I'd be plenty of room to do things my way. On the other side I'd be all alone, without anyone to learn with and from.

In career terms, would that be a suicidal move? Is there a risk to ""cut myself out"" the DS job market?

Have you every been the first DS in a company? Did you ever move from ""multi DS"" to ""single DS"" companies? And what have your learned from that?

I hope this might help also other readers too. Any advice is very welcome.",Moving to a company where you are the only DS: growth opportunity or suicidal move?,1618661850
