datascience,"I'm from final year mechanical engineering student currently trying to get recruited with campus placements for Data related role in my college (India)
So, yesterday i applied to a healthcare company which had it's first aptitude test round for the job of Data engineer, Devops, software development all together in a single test. Being from mechanical engineering i don't really have knowledge of Java and experience in competitive coding but that was exactly what was present in the test. I'm slowly loosing hopes of getting recruited as the Companies need all the skills from Computer science engineering even for Data engineer role. As far as i know Data engineer don't really need these types of skills so i didn't really prepare for them yet.

datascience,"Hello, I'm a recent graduate from UC Santa Cruz with a major in Technology and Information Management. It's part of the engineering department at UCSC but I've had a tough time finding a job since my graduation in June.

A friend of mine graduated with the same degree a few years back and recommended Springboard Data Science, and I'm almost done with the first week (and also the last week you can get a full refund, hence my question!) .

I'm wondering what your thoughts are in terms of helping me be more competitive in the industry, and if its worth it, especially from a time standpoint (I am fortunate to have a little extra cash on hand to pay for it upfront, and am willing to spend the money if it is worth the program)",Thoughts on Springboard for Data Science?,1599960792

datascience,"I am just starting out as a data analyst shifting careers since i have little work experience and a degree in project management. I have always been intrigued by data science. I have asked around for free websites/tools to learn data science but haven't found any that go beyond the introductory stage. I've taken some free introductory courses about python. Have a good knowledge about basic to intermediate Sql queries so i think it's time to move to the next level of my journey.

Obviously with Datacamp there is no option for a monthly subscription and you have to buy the annual subscription all at once. I like Datacamp because its interactive and the free trial seemed to convince me that its a good place to learn data science.

I would like to know if its the best site to get started with Datascience and with the 99$ annual subscription is it the best deal out there or is there any other website i should subscribe to instead of Datacamp and why ?

Please let me know.",Is a Datacamp annual subscription worth it ?,1599956786

datascience,"I’ve been trying to get my company to take a more “Bezosian” approach to information: instead of using PowerPoints, write detailed memos or documentation. Have the stakeholders read the documentation prior to a meeting, and use the meeting time to discuss/for questions. 

Taking it a step further, I like to use an auto-documentation tool like Sphinx. That way, when I’m building a report, I can keep iteration on the models and the documentation will automatically update (or using Jupyter and converting it into html/pdf). The documentation can be split into high level overview and a more technical (with code snippets) logical flow. Then for visualizations, just link to Tableau. 

A lot of technical work seems too heavy to be disseminated into PowerPoint slides. I like the idea of writing a story/narrative, rather than using bullet points. It’s harder to understand Info on a PowerPoint and no one will read a long appendix. However, if you craft a narrative with good documentation, it’s easier to follow. 

Does anyone else feel this way about PowerPoint? It’s difficult because in my experience, many execs are used to presentations. But it just doesn’t seem to go well with data science work. I’m frustrated with wasting my time formatting powerpoints and think documentation/Tableau are the way to go.","As data scientists, does anyone else despise PowerPoint?",1599934588

datascience,"Hi,

I've done a Master's in physics with a final thesis involving CNNs and two courses on data science. In the last months I've expanded on that thesis as a research assistant (after graduating). Since I want to get into data science (and need to earn money soon) I see two options here:

1. Getting a job in the industry, duh
2. Doing a PhD in physics, probably doing a bunch of computational stuff, since my field is relatively data driven (Dark Matter research)

Now I've grown up listening to the same mantra over and over again: You study physics? You need a PhD - but its that so? A PhD will take me 3-4 years and while there are some projects that really interest me (one institute is founded specifically as ML in physics research!) I am currently in contact with a consulting company that sounds promising to me (especially as they are all about ""investing in my skills and development"" and seem like a cool team of young people).

Now if I were to take that job, would I regret not having done a PhD in my future career? I've been going back and forth for quite a while and I'm thankful for any input!",PhD outside of academia,1599932616

* it, Basics of Python Programming
* Pandas and Numpy Library 
* Basic Statistics using Python
* Statistical tests, their implementation, and their Application in real-life
* Basic SQL Programming
* Machine Learning using Python - To start with key algorithms in Supervised and Unsupervised Learning and slowly get into more complex algorithms and techniques commonly used in a Data Science project

I am currently an undergraduate student in my second year studying Bsc Economics (Hons) at one of the top unis in London. I have recently decided I wanted to get into data science as I’ve been exposed to it more and have been trying to learn things like python,R,SQL etc etc. I am stuck atm as I am deciding between finishing my studies in eco or dropping out and starting Computer Science at another uni which I can still enroll today however it is a lower end uni in London and my friend studies CS there and said the teaching is horrible. Is this transition worth it or should I just carry on with eco and self teach myself the basics to get into data analytics (not data science to start with) I think progression towards a data scientist can be made later in my career.
