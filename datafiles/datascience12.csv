datascience,"I recently applied for a Data Scientist job for a largeish well known International company at their New York branch in long island. This is not a new york city job. I know i'm way under the mark if i wanted to work in the city. The job description asked for 2-3 years of experience; I put my desired salary as 65-75k.  It seemed reasonable since I am getting 54k right now. When I had the phone interview the person said that 65-75k was actually a bit low for the position and suggested I adjust it.  I raised it to 75-85k. When I filled out more forms I only put 75k since I couldn't input a range. Without giving out my resume am i screwing myself over.   


Should I have gone higher? I know i am currently underpaid but it feels weird to potentially have a 20k-30k salary bump essentially overnight.

I am highly feeling that I am not learning a lot in my data analytics courses and want to try to do something through my work that would be valuable to the company, while being able to learn more on my own.

My intended idea was to understand customer attrition by creating first creating a customer ranking system based on things they do in my company's program they use. For example, for a fleet maintenance program, a customer may be scored on the number of work orders they create, their parts, purchase orders, etc. These would have some type of weight attached to them that would have to be decided.

Essentially I would use these scores to predict which customers are at risk of leaving us. Is this something that is possible using ML, and what advice would you have for me? Our customer data is in an AWS environment.",Creating a customer attrition model for my work.,1582577719

datascience,"**Background**: Did my undergrad in Mathematics, minor in Comp Sci. Most of my math electives revolved around statistical inference, probability, and discrete math. Took electives in business too (accounting, finance, econ). Graduated in May 2019.

**My current role and experience**: Started as a Spring Intern 2019, Summer Intern 2019, then  joined full-time in August as a ""Jr. Business Analyst."" in the Corporate Finance/FP&amp;A division. Previous intern experience in finance (fixed income research). I am located in NYC, FWIW. 

**My responsibilities:**  are more on the analytics/visualization/reporting side of things. I use R, Python and SQL to create ad-hoc analyses or for automating processes. Additionally, I am the only report developer in my division maintaining our Power BI app, so I spend a lot of time coming up with DAX as well. We have a Power BI team for the company as a whole, involving Sales, Ops, and the Database Architects, and I solely represent the Finance division, while also helping other teams with their own Power BI projects. 

The most ""Data Science"" project I'll be working on is developing a forecasting model for sales--looking to use time series/regression analysis for that one, then eventually it will become more complex as need be. 

I am starting to dislike dashboarding and being closely involved with the business. Dashboarding is starting to feel like monkey work and working with non-technical people, (technologically illiterate) is frustrating because they don't really know what they want, or ask for something that isn't feasible. I am seeking to be in a role that's more research oriented, or focused exclusively in programming/statistics (model building, validation, etc.). 

It's nice to be recognized by key stakeholders in the business, but I would prefer to be in a more technical role, which is more stimulating--also looking for somewhat of a mentor. My superiors all come from business backgrounds. Additionally, I am being severely underpaid for my work (60% below market rate). There are ""Business Intelligence Analysts"" in other divisions who can't do half of what I do, or even possess my skillset (they are just Power BI and Excel monkeys), but have a nicer title and are paid more than me. 

Any advice to get out of BI and into a true data science role--will start shopping around when my 1 year mark in my current role passes? 

I'm refreshing my knowledge in calc, linear algebra, probability theory, and statistical inference. In addition, I'm becoming more familiar with the popular Python libraries for DS (sci-kit learn, Keras, TensorFlow), learning from the *Hands on Machine Learning* book.

score = top-post-amount + (upvotes * 0.5)
I know that’s not really a statistical approach (but I had statistics last time in school and I’m not studying DS yet).

datascience,"So recently I was working on a NN model to predict power outage depending on population, weather etc.. each day. I used StandardScaler() to scale the data. Training and Testing gave me an accuracy of around 90% which was good enough for my particular application. Next I saved my model and wrote a flask code where I loaded this model.
Now the problem I am facing is while predicting I am getting input from the website linked with the Flask code, and this is just one row at a time. Running just one row through StandardScaler is not helping. I have tried saving the scaler from training and loading it up again for prediction but that didn't help me either.

datascience,"Hi all,

I'm in a bit of a unique situation as I begin entering into the data world. A little backstory: I graduated with my B.S. in Software Development last May and eventually landed a job as a non-IT-related Field Tech ""with a leaning toward IT/software"" in a small business that contracts with power utilities as their energy experts and to process their consumers' energy rebates. Not quite what I went to school for, but I'm happy to have a solid job with great benefits, and it turns out that I really enjoy the energy industry.

I've talked to management quite a bit about their thoughts on the future of the industry. I foresee a lot of room for growth in the way power utilities operate for numerous reasons and how we, as specialty contractors in this industry, can adapt - but that's a much different discussion. Because of my previous personal interest in pursuing a data degree, I began asking around about how impactful a data analyst could be to the company. How the Director of Operations put it: ""I actually wish we had a data expert in the company and I have brought it up to the others in the past; I even considered pursuing it myself once. By the way, have you heard about our Employee Education Reimbursement program?""

Fast forward to today, only three months on the job, I will start my Master's in Data Analytics in a week with half of my first term's tuition in contract to be reimbursed, plus future reimbursement contingent on my progress and company funds. Now that they are financially investing in me to become their first established data expert, I'm wondering what kind of talking points I can bring up to management to begin with. Last week, I asked the Director of Operations for a meeting sometime soon, to which she agreed, where we can talk about my future with the company and how I can best be utilized as my data skillset grows.

I want to prepare a list of talking points for when I meet with her. I am completely new to this industry (save for a few data classes from my software degree). But as their future data expert, I want to take charge by telling them how I think I could be best utilized both while in school and after I graduate.

TL;DR - I'm starting school to become my company's first data expert and have no clue how to start making myself useful.

datascience,"Hi,

I posted in [CareerQuestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f89to3/need_advice_which_job_is_best_to_become_a_data/) but I decided to post in this subreddit as well just in case. My long term goal is to become a data scientist. I am currently seeking a job, mostly looking at 'analyst' types of job where I can gain some experience doing data analysis and slowly transition to data science. I also consider doing a Master of Statistics after I get used to my job and have some experience. I receive (or at least have the best shot at receiving an offer) at the following jobs (salary is in $AU). Money is not so important for me (either way it's a pay cut from my marketing job in Japan) as I'm looking to gain experience so that I can become a data scientist or at least a data analyst in the future. What's your opinion? Which job is best to become a data scientist in the future? 

*Note: Please don't suggest me to keep my marketing job, I already quit. I understand that I'd have to do lots of self-study and be proactive to take on projects at work to improve some skills such as Python. But my task here is to pick a job that I will least likely to regret.* 

\- **'Business Intelligence' at** [FDM Group](https://au.gradconnection.com/employers/fdm-group/consultants-testimonials/): they're not my actual employer, they take new grad and train them then put the grads with some clients (mostly financial firms). Their wage is actually the highest out of all offers, 52k while training, 56k (1st year), 58k (2nd year). The training is on SQL, VBA and some theories of data warehousing. However, the risk is that I don't know where and which position I'll get placed, but likely to be a financial firm. On top of that, it's 2 years contract so if the placement sucks, I stuck for 2 years. I'm attracted to the wage and I think it's the most relevant (because of SQL), but there're some risks...

**- Business Analyst at the** [Data School](https://www.theinformationlab.co.uk/): 4 months of training on Tableau and Alteryx then 3 x 6 months projects with clients. Like FDM, it's also a 2-year contract but at least I have 3 projects, not just stuck with 1 client. Salary is something like 53k (1st year), 58k (2nd year), all certs are paid for. I like the culture here and data visualisation is the most fun aspect. However, I think becoming a specialist on Tableau and Alteryx can be a bit too limited. A lot of the alumni seem to remain at the Data School, some work as a consultant/analyst somewhere else.

\- **Research Analyst** (market research firms): write insight reports, analyse industry trend. The job ad doesn't require SQL, so I think I use mostly Excel and Tableau, though I need to check case-by-case with the employer. Seems to be quite heavy on writing. I don't like to write that much, I'm good with presentations but I hate writing long reports. Salary: around 50k.

\- **Media/Digital Analyst**: working in a media/analytics firm, will progress to become a 'Media/Digital Consultant'. Job doesn't seem to require SQL but they like it when I talked about Tableau and they liked the fact that I worked for a media previously. Salary: 47k (first year). This is relevant to my previous experience in marketing. However, career progression can be limited as the marketing/media industry in Australia seems to be small and there's not a lot of jobs. Pay is low too.

I tried other big firms, consulting, finance, more 'technical' analyst jobs, but don't even get a callback. The above are my current options as I seem to be able to go the furthest with my application. I'm inclined towards FDM because (1) the content sounds the most relevant (2) salary is actually the highest (3) last chance to break into the financial industry. However, the mixed review plus the risk prompt me to at least consider other options. Reviews for FDM in Australia is actually really good because they offer much better terms here, compared to the UK and US.

Hi there,

I  am a foreigner that moved to another country because I was so excited  about a  job opportunity of Data Analyst. Since the beginning one year  ago, I  could improve a lot in Statistics, R, SQL.

I  would love to learn new things so that slowly I can switch from  ""data  analysis"" to ""data science"". Specifically about statistics, what I   focused this year was simple inference tests, Multiple Regression,   non-linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Cross Validation techniques   and a bit of Structural Equation Modeling.

What  would be the logical next step to do? I am eager to learn new   techniques ""on the field"" :) I would like something useful for marketing  purposes, customer's behaviour and the like! Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!",Next steps for a Data Scientist prospect?,1582466712
datascience,"Even science is not free from myths and legends. There are some beliefs that people tend to take to heart, and data science has a few of them. These beliefs can cause problems like stereotypes that give people the wrong impression or ideas that will discourage prospective ones from pursuing the field. Here are some of the biggest myths in the sector.  
 **1. Data Science is all Science**  
  Data science is not just science, but an art as well. The field of data science can go beyond numbers and tables and test your reasoning ability, aptitude and creative ability. It is not a science, strictly speaking, but a combination of scientific principles and a level of artistic thinking. Each problem is a unique conundrum which cannot be solved by assigning values to a variable and solving an equation. It is not a skill to be learned but a process.  


**2. Data Science requires a doctorate**  


This assumption is not entirely correct, but a partial truth. The job role and preferences decide the level of education one needs. However, one does need a firm grasp on statistics and mathematics and fundamental coding skills. The rest depends on the type of job.  
In entry-level data science jobs, such as in applied data science and analytics, you do not need a PhD. Your work requires you to use packages and algorithms built in the workplace and apply the principles for clients. However, research jobs require a PhD as you will be creating your algorithm and writing a paper on it.   
**3. It’s all about the tools**  


It is another misconception about data science. It is a field that uses various tools and applications, with computers doing most of the heavy work as far as computation goes. However, just like every other job, a device is only as good as the person using it.  
The focal point of your learning should be about the practical application of the tools. Many people who enter the trade end up learning the tools only, which cannot help them succeed in this path. It is always good to know the various platforms, software and packages used in data science, but not as important as knowing when and how to use them. Therefore, the learning should be work-oriented.  


**4. Coding is a must-know**  


Coding is a versatile weapon, and knowing a programming language will do wonders for your CV no matter which career you pursue. However, It is not something to rack your brains over. Due to the widespread use of programming, ready-made codes are available on the Internet, for almost every purpose.  
This is not implying that knowing coding is useless........

The issue I have is that using all 3 seems kind of redundant. It seems you either use SQL + Python/R or SQL + tableau. Is it right to assume that SQL is used to pull extremely large datasets, convert to a smaller dataset for python or R, which can then be used to visualize? Also, why even use SQL for anything when we can use sqlite?

One example I can think of is using python to scrape data from somewhere, SQL to reorganize and perform joins, and tableau to visualize. However, the SQL step just seems redundant at that point.",how to integrate R/python + SQL + tableau?,1582414324
datascience,"&gt;When I started working as a data scientist, I found out that having a background in software engineering is very helpful. Only training a model is not enough, you need to go to production, and this is something many data scientists struggle with. They know how to read papers and implement algorithms from these papers, but going to production is a different thing. That’s why having some exposure to software engineering is helpful for data scientists to make use of their models and solve business problems faster.  
&gt;  
&gt;I tried to go deep into math, but in the end, it wasn’t needed. Even though it’s fun to study it, the job I and many of my colleagues are doing is different. We don’t solve math equations. We spend months preparing a dataset, then take a library, wait for ten minutes for training to finish, get a model, and then again spend months on productionizing the model.  
&gt;  
&gt;The part of training a model doesn’t take a lot of time, yet the focus of many programs at universities and many online courses is on the mathematics behind ML. Yes, it’s still needed: as a data scientist, you sometimes need to understand what’s going on inside the libraries — to the same extent that a software engineer needs to know how TCP/IP works. However, not many software engineers need to go deep down the network stack daily. Maybe once in five years, when there’s a problem, but day-to-day work typically doesn’t require that.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, you just need to have broad knowledge and good exposure to different techniques. Knowing the details is good, but not always necessary. All you need is the foundations — to be able to notice if things aren’t right. But when you face a problem, then you need to go deeper.  
&gt;  
&gt;I did it the other way around and tried to understand everything in advance. Instead, I should have focused on hands-on skills, and dig deep when it’s required.

datascience,"I'm in a graduate program for analytics and am on the data science track, so apologies if I sound naive. I'm in a course that teaches python from a data science perspective and some assumptions I had are being challenged.

All of the work for this course has us coding our own versions of simple data science tools in python. For instance, build your own function that takes a matrix X and returns an OLS estimator B using linear algebra in numpy. Or, add code to a pre-written linear model class that returns the Newey-West estimator of B.

Obviously, many packages and methods exist to do this already, and students are complaining that they don't see the point in these tedious (and difficult) exercises. But, others are saying you often cannot utilize packages like statsmodels or sklearn in the real world and need to make your own, so it's good practice.

&amp;#x200B;

So, for those of you already in the ""real world"": Do you typically spend your time cleaning and engineering your data to be compatible with existing convenient packages? Or, do you take the data as given and build your own versions of models?

datascience,"Hi, so I’m new to data science, so please forgive me if I’m not clear with my question; I’ll try to provide more context here. 

I have a dataset where each row is a “job”. Each job has a start date and time as well as a duration and also how many records were processed in total. My ultimate goal is to understand the throughput on a given day in terms of records processed.

Example: a job starts on Monday at noon with 100 records in the payload and it finishes on Tuesday at noon, which means it has processed 50 records/day. Another job started on that same Monday at 6pm and finished by 8pm with another 100 records (the job ran parallel to the other, and finished faster). The two jobs together yield 150 throughput on Monday, and 50 on Tuesday. 

That’s what I’m trying to figure out with a dataset of about 1 million rows with that kind of information to understand patterns and usage. 

What am I asking for, exactly? Just a nudge in the right direction. Maybe the name of a plot or technique I should look into applying. For example, I was thinking of a Gantt chart for this but I think it would be too large to be useful, but it would give me the ability to take a slice of time and see exactly what was running then. Maybe I can aggregate the data first somehow in some meaningful way? Maybe a calendar heatmap or something? I thought about splitting rows into multiple rows if the job spanned more than a single day, then I could group activity by individual day, but I’m not sure how to slice the throughput at the same time. 

I’m new to data science, but I’m not terrible with R, I am just looking for guidance on what to tell R I need to do (if that’s the right tool for this).

datascience,"So, a little background, I'm a Geologist, I work at a Geophysics company where we mostly do research projects for mining and O&amp;G exploration companies. 

My role as a ML Researcher is to come up with ideas for machine learning applications in geophysics and develop models in the ongoing projects. We also sell data management software, but the development team is a different bulding.

As a result, most of my coworkers are other geologists, geophysicists or petroleum engineers, who most often know very little coding (some basic matlab is generally the upper limit). In most of our projects they're responsible for data annotation (especially the other geologists, as a good amount of what I do is trying to automate their interpretations).

This leads, however, to some of my coworkers coming to me with problems totally unrelated to my job, like asking me if I can convert the matlab script they use to do this analysis to python, or asking me if I can make them a script to automatically generate a bunch of plots for them (at least they're coding competent enough to run scripts).

I mostly don't mind this, especially because I have a lot of downtime between projects, as exploration companies are very careful with giving us access to their data, and because if I can speed up their jobs it means I have better data in less time.

This is, however, not my job, and I generally tell them ""This isn't my job, but I can try to help you out"". What I worry about is this evolving to the point where I'm seen as the ""code guy"" in the office and end up doing a bunch of trivial shit for most of my day.

You have access to all user profiles, a list of jobs each user applied to, and questions that the user answered about their job search. How would you build a job recommendation feed?""  (Random question off Interview Query)

**Candidate:** ""Okay, I'd like to know how much data we have? And how did we get the list of jobs each user applied to? Was it based off of a user searching on LinkedIn and then a relevance feed from that search or was it from an existing recommendation engine?""

**Interviewer:** ""Let's say that data size is not an issue, you have over 100 million user to job matches. And that we got it off of user's searching on LinkedIn.""

**Candidate:** ""Okay, we can then use an unsupervised or supervised model. If we use a supervised model we would need more data on the jobs that a user would not apply to. In this case we have to do some feature engineering and more data to get jobs in the user search that they passed on. We can look at browsing data for jobs that were ranked high in the search but were still passed on...""

datascience,"I'm a current physics PhD candidate finishing up my thesis and I plan to go into data science afterwards. However I've noticed in my work now that I enjoy the actual writing of the analysis code and brainstorming how to design to program to do certain things with the data etc, far more than I enjoy the part that comes after that (or sometimes in parallel), which is interpreting the data using statistics, domain knowledge or more specific statistical analysis that lack any real coding component (basically the science part of my thesis lol).

I'm starting to worry that I'll be unhappy in DS because of that. But since I don't have real world DS experience, I'm wondering what is everyone's experience on how much they spend their time working on statistics related topics in general versus developing the code that does whatever you need it to do?

PS: I used Python for all of my work. Also I do know that a machine learning engineer might be closer to software engineering and therefore closer to what I'm looking for, however I thought my background would make it easier for me transition to a DS role first especially since I don't have any formal CS background and most interviews seem to have intense coding components. 

TL;DR: I enjoy writing code in Python more than I enjoy thinking or working on the statistical part of the analysis. Worried this means a career in DS is the wrong path.",How much of your DS role is code development vs working on stats?,1582380949

I've been there myself, I know it is annoying to hold multiple interviews with people who are unqualified. But realize how silly it is to save yourself a few days of work when determining who you are going to work with for the next 1-5 years.

Spend time thinking about how you get to know someone quickly and how you can pick their brain rather than trying to come up with the perfect set of silver bullet questions.

datascience,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently working (40 hours a week) in a charity as a Project Manager but would like to eventually transition into Analytics/Data Science. I'm naturally technical but don't have any programming skills, I'm a good problem solver but have never studied analytics, I have very basic math knowledge from my school days (I'm 31). I know I have a long path of learning ahead and I would love your advice is I'm heading on the right track. My dream would be to use data to enable charities to make better business and impactful decisions. 

&amp;#x200B;

In September 2021 I want to apply for a masters in *Statistics with Data Science*. I currently hold a Business Management bachelors degree and work in a project management position. My two-year learning plan is to prepare me for my masters and hopefully give me the base skills that I could potentially transition into a junior analytics role before or while studying my masters. I am intentionally avoiding heavy textbooks (apart from one statistics book) in the two-year phase before my masters to ease myself in (I dont traditionally learn well from heavy textbooks).

&amp;#x200B;

For my first year, I want to develop my current skills in excel to an advance level and learn the basics of analytics, business intelligence and coding (SQL &amp; Python) and dashboards. I want to start applying what I'm learning within my current role at work by doing side analytics projects using the charity data. The resources I plan to get through are (in 10 hours a week):

If you have any advice or critiques please let me know. I do worry I am taking on too much but I currently feel like I really need to get through level of learning in these two years. Year one to give me the base skills to get some hands-on experience doing data analytics in my current job, start doing side projects and potentially get a junior analyst/Business intelligence type role somewhere and year two to give me the prerequisite knowledge in maths and statistics to make it through my masters. Ultimately I want my masters because I eventually want to reach the data science level in my career.

datascience,"Hi Guys!
So I had an internship Interview for an analytics/machine learning post and I think I blew it :(

Anyway, here is the question I couldn't answer:

We have something called Attractiveness Quotient that goes form 0 to 1. 

We have the following variables that affects the attractiveness quotient:-

1. Eye color( has 4 categories- brown, blue, hazel, green)

2. Hair color ( has 3 categories - blonde, black, brunnete)

3. Weight 
4. Height 

Find the correlation between Attractiveness Quotient and all these variables. And he gave me a hint that different variables will have a different magnitude of effect on the attractiveness quotient. And he said the answer is purely based on statistics and not machine learning or anything. And he said that I just need to tell him the approach to go about doing this. 

I only know Pearson's coefficient related to correlation but I am very sure that won't be applicable here.

So, how do we solve this?",Interview question that I couldn't answer,1582360809
