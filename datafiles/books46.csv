books,"I recently started reading The Grapes of Wrath (still haven't finished, on the chapter where the family gets to know the government camp) and I'm f****** loving it. It gives you moments of pure cruelty that those people had to endure in the search for a better life, while still being as wholesome as possible even in the most heartbreaking moments. An example if that was the death of the grandmother which highlights (in my opinion) the best written character in the book, the mother (I don't know if I should spoil it for those wo event read this book, but it's soooo brutal). Mother is probably the woman should want in their life, such stoic mindset for the betterment and well being of the family is honestly inspiring.
Tho there were some issues I've been having with it, like the plotline with Noah that's kind comes out of nowhere, the book is pretty awesome and I wanted to take a the to just show some love for it, know how you guys felt about the book and to HIGHLY recommend it.

books,"I think any of us who have read Steinbeck's *East of Eden* know instinctively that Cathy represents pure chaotic evil--""Satan,"" if you will. Considering the overarching Biblical allegory of the novel--notably the fall of Adam and the kin-slaying of Abel--I posit that Cathy represents the Edenic Serpent who tricked Eve into biting from the fruit of wisdom (who I believe is represented by Abra but that's a whole other deep dive I might get into one day) and whose arms and legs were soon after detached by God as punishment. I kept track of every serpentine reference I came across to compile this list. Allow me to point out the numerous excerpts that brought me, overwhelmingly, to my conclusion:

&amp;#x200B;

1. In Steinbeck's famous treatise on the nature of monsters: **‚Äúsome are born with no arms and no legs‚Äù** (72)

2. ‚ÄúCathy was chewing on a piece of meat, chewing with her front teeth. Samuel had never seen anyone chew that way before. **And when she swallowed, her little tongue flickered around her lips**‚Äù (173). *Res ipsa loquitur*.

3. In his anxiety-ridden flashback, Samuel recalls a ""‚Äògolden man"" whose malevolent eyes remind him of the cool and detached eyes he had seen in Cathy. In Samuel‚Äôs memory, the golden man **‚Äúseemed to have no arms‚Äù** (178). In this vision of Satanic embodiment, Steinbeck is keen to drop in a subtle but unmistakable allusion to the Serpent of Eden.

4. In reference to Cathy, Steinbeck writes **""maybe such a look may have been sometime on a holy face‚Äù** (179). Is it not fitting that the evilest being in Biblical history happened to have once dwelt in the holiest (or at least, purest) site?

5. ""Her voice became chill and her mouth was thin. **Her wide-set eyes slitted** and grew watchful and sardonic."" (234)

6. \[Looking at Cathy\] ‚ÄúAdam peered at the girl before him . . . He tried to think of what animal, what night prowler, she reminded him. **It was some secret and predatory animal**.‚Äù (315)

7. \[Cathy to Adam\]: ""You‚Äôll come crawling back . . . **You‚Äôll drag your belly on the floor**\--begging, begging!"" (325) Ironic!

8. Ok, this one's a stretch but I think it's worth adding. Says Tom to Dessie, **‚ÄúI‚Äôve been dragging myself in misery like a spine-broken snake.‚Äù** (398)

9. **‚ÄúShe moistened her lips with an arrow-shaped tongue‚Äù** (505)

 *And this is probably my strongest token of evidence...*

10. Cathy tells Joe to **‚Äúcut these off--at the wrists‚Äù** (549) in reference to her hands. Additionally, her **""right hip ached when it moved""** (549). The debilitating and even incapacitating arthritis we see Cathy develop is a direct metaphor for God's famous retribution of the Serpent. After committing her crime, she is plagued by the deterioration of her hands and legs--distinctly analogous to the punishment of the Serpent at the fall of Adam.

Lastly, and most importantly, it should be noted that Cathy is the reason for the fall of Adam's ranch (What Adam calls his personal ""Eden"") into disarray. She is the pure evil and chaos that leads to Adam‚Äôs hardship and depression--analogous to the serpent, whose conniving lands the original Adam with a punishment entailed by working for his food and having to overcome inexorable ""thorns and thistles"" along the way.

books,"Hello everyone! Today I finished The Hobbit. I wanted to open a discussion for my sake on how to go about understanding this novel I began reading about three weeks ago. 
This is not the first fantasy book I‚Äôve read. I started with the Mistborn Trilogy, The Kingkiller Chronicles (I didn‚Äôt make it past Felurian sadly), and TSA up to Oathbringer. That being said, I didn‚Äôt want to gloss over any details by listening to the book on Audible like I have all the others, so I instead read the whole thing. Unfortunately, I think I missed something.

Firstly, while I really enjoyed reading this book, it did not appeal to me as strongly as the more contemporary fiction I have read. I think my interest in the book began to seriously wane after Bilbo escaped the Elvenking‚Äôs prison. After that, I kind of just wanted the story to be over. Once I finally got to Smaug, I felt nearly as exhausted as Bilbo must have felt at the end of his journey, and even more so when Thorin decided to start shit with all the kingdoms leading up to the Battle of Five Armies. I started glossing over a lot of text, which I know is bad because I want to process all the information available, but I suspect Tolkien was writing at this point to conclude the story, and nothing more.

I believe there is something that I am missing. I know this book was meant for children, but I am unable to parse any meaning from Bilbo‚Äôs adventure other than Thorin‚Äôs dying words about appreciating song and cheer over dragon‚Äôs gold. I wonder what significant puzzles or allegories did I miss during my first reading. Other than being delighted by the journey at face value, and watching Bilbo grow from a lazy hobbit to a brave and cunning burglar, what aspects of this story I am missing?

At any rate, I wish everyone the best of luck on their journeys. I recommend reading The Hobbit, if you have not already. Soon, I must turn my sails towards up and coming class assignments. Thank you for reading!",Today I finished The Hobbit,1597437043

I usually don't let politics guide what I read or indulge in at all, and this to me really didn't seem like a political series, it was such a bizarre unrealistic scenario that didn't seem like ""abortion"" at all as it was heavily post-birth.

For other readers of the book : do you find this as a political series or just an interesting and unique setup like I did. I just can't see how something as absurd as murder from 13 to 17 can be taken as protesting abortions and the reasons behind them.

books,"So guys, there are basically three(ish) months left before the US Presidential election. I plan to break that time up into four segments and read one book corresponding to each of four major US political movements before the election. A rough plan is below, but I‚Äôm still thinking out how to structure this.

books,"Brad Thor's ""Near Dark"" spy thriller was a good read, where he battled alcoholism and depression after his wife was murdered (In the previous book), while simultaneously hunting down her killers who placed a huge bounty on his head, which was open to all assassins, worldwide. His characterization was excellent- even the evil doers were three-dimensional, where he brought out their past and you understood why the became who they were. I noticed his ratings on Amazon were mostly 4- and 5-Stars, but some gave him very low ratings. You either liked the book, or didn't.

books,"I‚Äôve always been an avid reader, but I‚Äôve never really enjoyed classic literature. I thought it was boring and needlessly hard to read. And when school made such readings mandatory, I found myself mostly only reading summaries on the Internet. And I know most of my classmates took such a disliking to classics as to never touch them again after high school.

But now, a few months after graduating, I found myself growing more and more interested in classic literature, to the point some modern books don‚Äôt seem to satisfy me anymore. 

I was reading the modern dystopian series The Maze Runner, and I was loving it (I still love it, actually). But in the middle of the fourth book I picked up a Jane Austen to read. Then when I came bake to TMR i could only go a few pages before I decided I wanted another reading like Austen‚Äôs and picked up a national classic. It‚Äôs been three classic books since and I still haven‚Äôt been able to finish TMR. 

I feel like classics provide such a high pleasure, based on the very sake of reading and learning new words and pushing yourself, and basically enjoying the story and reading in itself, other than on individual juicy/action parts made to seem enticing and hook up the reader. 

I‚Äôm not saying modern literature isn‚Äôt good. I love so many modern books. But I feel like there‚Äôs a time when people learn by themselves to appreciate things in a deeper level. Now I‚Äôm addicted to classics and I want to read everything I skipped in high school. To read those stories that I thought were boring but that now I can see are so very interesting when you take the time to dedicate yourself to the reading.

But I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve enjoyed them as much if somebody had forced me to read them at a time I wasn‚Äôt ready. I understand why schools have to it, it‚Äôs important to make us acquainted with our classics, show us timeless literature, but I also have the impression that the way it‚Äôs currently done it might have the opposite effect and push people further away from books :(

books,"There were several books that were required reading in High School, that I absolutely hated.   
One was ""Death Comes to the Archbishop"". I recently re-read it and absolutely loved it. So much so that I read everything I could find by Willa Cather. High School was 40 years ago. I am sure that greater life experience added to my enjoyment.  
There are two books I am considering re-reading and would appreciate your opinion which I should re-read first.  
1. ""The Old Man in the Sea"" I found it tedious as a teenager.  
2. ""Ghosts"" by  Henrick Ibsen. I was required to write a paper on it. Mine was titled ""Sexual Perversions in Ibsen's ""Ghosts"".

books,"Hi! I‚Äôm a 15 year old girl, and I have a 9 year old little brother. Long story short, my mom doesn‚Äôt live with me, so I tutor my little brothers (the other one is 13, he‚Äôs doing okay in school) for my dad.

My little brother is really difficult to deal with. He throws tantrums, screams, is super stubborn, doesn‚Äôt ask for help, and the most annoying thing: he only cares about video games. It wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if it was the only hobby he‚Äôs ever had, so much to the point that it has made him fall very behind in school, especially with distance learning.

He‚Äôs so behind in his reading (he never reads books for fun) that he‚Äôs in ESOL (For kids whose first language isn‚Äôt English) even though the only language he speaks is English! He also is struggling in math, which is understandable. I‚Äôve just been giving him a lot of worksheets that I make myself to give him practice.

Would any of you be willing to share tips on how to handle his resentment towards learning? I‚Äôve been tutoring him for about a month now, and I‚Äôll admit, there were days I just couldn‚Äôt handle it and had to take a break. Not related, but he‚Äôs a picky eater and always screams and refuses to eat what my dad gives him. I wish he‚Äôd be more grateful for what he has. 

I tried to make reading fun for him, but I don‚Äôt have a lot of books and going to the library is not an option during this time... He hates all the books I try to read to him, and that‚Äôs not his fault. It‚Äôs hard to read a book you‚Äôre not interested in.

Would anyone be willing to buy/donate him some chapter books that a 9 year old boy with an obsession with video games would like? Maybe something you‚Äôve outgrown, or just anything (I don‚Äôt really have that many books either, and would appreciate if someone donated a book they liked to me üòä). 

We don‚Äôt  really have money to spare on books, and it would help me out so much. He‚Äôs in 3rd grade and should be reading chapter books by now... I have the 4th Percy Jackson book and the hunger games series but they‚Äôre a bit too advanced for him and I don‚Äôt really have anything else. 

Thank you so so so much for reading this, I don‚Äôt really expect anything to come out of this, but thought I would try anyway.
