books,"Been reading a number of serial killer thrillers lately and it seems it varies from book to book.

For those of you who have read these kinds of books what do you prefer?

Do you like to see from the killer's point of view (maybe have a chapter or two from them) and know who they are right from the get go....or do you like to be left in the dark and have no chapters from them and have a reveal at the end? ( where the person could have been someone the detective interviewed or might be a random stranger?)

&amp;#x200B;

I had no introduction to this book, and I'm shocked at what it actually entailed.  I only learned after reading it that there was a movie about it.  When I started I honestly thought it was a modern day novel about a woman who lost her child in infancy and was struggling with mourning for her. I don't know how I missed the entire plot about her being an escaped slave before reading it considering that information is on the back of the book.

&amp;#x200B;

The first 100 pages or so were pretty unremarkable.  I had a hard time getting into Morrison's prose and style considering how often she shifts between perspectives and time frames.  I had a hard time understanding what in the world happened at all that lead up to the story we are now in.  It wasn't until the chapter in which the schoolteacher comes to the house and finds them all in the back shed, that I got completely hooked.  After this point I couldn't put the book down and stayed up until 1:00 in the morning to finish it.

&amp;#x200B;

While in the beginning of the book I had a hard time with the writing style, I was truly able to appreciate it for what it was after I finished it.  Morrison is writing from the perspective of multiple trauma survivors and that has a profound effect on how they're read in my opinion.  I felt that she was intentionally vague throughout so that the reader could experience the story slowly starting to unfold and make sense as they read. I liked the feeling that I had to work for the information in a way, it wasn't gleefully just provided for me, I had to take time to think about the implications of what she is saying.

&amp;#x200B;

I've read a handful of novels that are told through enslaved people's perspectives, each time it is haunting that slavery was such a recent and profound part of our history.  But nothing made me feel the true trauma that people go through as much as Beloved.  I am a mother too which is probably why this book was especially impactful to me.  I can't ever imagine a situation in which I would think that killing my children would be the best option, but when reading Sethe's story and her trying to justify it to herself, I truly sympathized with her and I could understand her compassion in such a horrid act.  There were layers upon layers of gray in her character and I'm glad we were introduced to her as we were, that she was just a woman, wanting to love but unable to, so quick and willing to love a man that she knew and shared her history, her trauma.  

&amp;#x200B;

This book is amazing with it's imagery.  I finished this book with multiple, horrible images that will be in my mind indefinitely.  For all of Morrison's confusing and almost vague language, I am left with very clear pictures in my mind that I don't think will leave any time soon.  After finishing this book last night I honestly didn't know how I felt about it.  The ending was odd to me at first, but now that I've had a chance to sleep on it and ponder it, I have to say that it truly is a masterpiece.",Just finished Beloved By Morrison for the first time,1586886640

books,"\- What a magnificent sensory experience this was. I am speechless. Instantly this has become my favorite book, and it has everything. Hard science fiction? Sure. Evolutionary subplots displaying the Mind presented through time from Neanderthal to Homo Sapien to self-aware computers to the unknown? Yep. A world conquering Star Child?! This...this book was something else entirely. Arthur C. Clark, and writing in partnership for the film world Stanley Kubrick, put together a masterpiece I'm not sure I can fully grasp after one read through.

\- That this book was beautifully written, researched, adapted to film, etc... is an understatement. I've never read something that forced me to feel so...insignificant. So minute...The ride Clark takes us on here commanded me to put down the book multiple times to digest its contents, and my own petty issues in life. I'm positive there are those out there who could blow my mind with some of the intricate nuances of the Monoliths, the Star Gates, symbolisms behind the Star Child, even these interstellar phenomenons that are described (White Dwarfs, Gobular Clusters). The story still revolves around a human-centric narrative, but becomes so much more. The universe has never intrigued me so strongly. 

\- My mind kept traveling to Fate, and the possibility of God or godlike figures controlling life and galaxies in reality. As rational/scientific human beings many of us can only believe what can be proven.  For us normal folk, only what we can sense and interact with on a day to day basis. Yet, our logic, our reason, our understandings are all limited to our experiences on Earth, and its galaxy, for the most part. The cosmos is still such an unexplorable mystery, and for the most part we lack the knowledge and the technology to explore the far reaches of what is really out there. We are so finite compared to the big concept of the universe, and I cannot imagine so of the glorious worlds, moons, stars...beings? that may truly be out there.

\- I really recommend this book to anyone quarantined and looking for a fantastic mental journey. I really believe this should be required reading in school. The movie is one of my favorites as well, but somehow I had more of a mind-meld with the book. I'd love to hear others opinions or commentary on this masterpiece!
