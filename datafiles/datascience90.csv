datascience,"I couldn't think of an elegant way to explain the question in the title so hold judgement on it until I explain further with an example.

Many of the data sources I use are estimates. For intercensal population from the Census Bureau as one example, when a new version comes out the source will update the prior year's estimates using the new data. In v2020 population for Springfield in year 2015 could be 1,000. But then in v2021 population for Springfield 2015 might be 1,005. In some cases the changes are so extreme using older data is just not possible. However, most of the time it's minor enough not to change takeaways but rather just to make the results a little different. This is the case with a good number of the sources I use.

I feel bound to use the freshest data possible. The non-technical folks hate this. It means prior materials no longer jibe with new ones and they have to explain it to clients. So I always get pushback on it. There have been a few situations where I simply couldn't convince my boss and had to use prior estimates.

So my question to you, my data brethren: does anyone ever utilize the old estimates in situations like this? Do you think it's defensible? Or are there no circumstances in which you would ever do so?",Do you ever stick with legacy estimates or always use the most recent?,1616000315
datascience,"I've been doing some text analytics work, and am trying out LDA (Latent Direchlet Analysis) as a way of categorizing text into different topics.  I've used it for two sets of survey data, one from local post offices, and one from medical education, and some police report data. Before getting into real data, I ran through some online exercises in R and Python, for sorting chapters of classic books.  (You know, where you get ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", and ""Nemo"", ""Submarine"", and so forth pop out, and ""Pride and Prejudice"", where ""Elizabeth"", and ""Proposal"" pop out, and so on.)

I'm unwhelmed by the results.   For the data sets I'd done topic modeling on by hand, and have a fair amount of domain knowledge.   I've played with varying parameters, but had a fairly clear idea going in what a 'reasonable' number of categories would be.

The category clusters use common words, but I can't think what the clusters are supposed to represent, even when I go back and look at the quotes that best match those categories.   For example, with the post office one, you'd think ""Damaged stuff"", ""Late Mail"",  ""Missing Items"", or ""Like my Mail Guy"" would come out, but I can't go from the word clusters suggested by LDA to any of these obvious categories.  In the medical stuff, one concept that gets mentioned a lot is ""Broken Arm Syndrome"", and I find that ""Broken"" and ""Arm"" appear in different clusters.  (There's nothing else in this data set related to ""Broken"" or ""Arm"" separately).

I'm wondering if text size is the problem.  While the corpus size is at least 10k's of words, and \~1M in some sets, the individual quotes are almost all &lt;100 words, with some only a few.  Could that be the problem?   Those of you who have some experiences with real data sets and LDA, could you confirm or deny whether you've been successful.

I’ve just finished building a little side project of mine - [https://gpu.land/](https://gpu.land/).

**What is it?** Cheap GPU instances in the cloud.

**Why is it awesome?**

* It’s dirt-cheap. You get a Tesla V100 for $0.99/hr, which is 1/3 the cost of AWS/GCP/Azure/\[insert big cloud name\].
* It’s dead simple. It takes 2mins from registration to a launched instance. Instances come pre-installed with everything you need for Deep Learning, including a 1-click Jupyter server.
* It sports a retro, MS-DOS-like look. Because why not:)

I’m a self-taught ML engineer. I built this because when I was starting my ML journey I was totally lost and frustrated by AWS. Hope this saves some of you some nerve cells (and some pennies)!

The most common question I get is - how is this so cheap? The answer is because AWS/GCP are charging you a huge markup and I’m not. In fact I’m charging just enough to break even, and built this project really to give back to community (and to learn some of the tech in the process).

datascience,"Imposter syndrome comes up in this sub a lot, and as someone who feels like he has (mostly) learned to manage it, I wanted to share my experience with it - and what was ultimately my major breakthrough.

In a nutshell, there are three ideas that you need to get in your head in order to get over imposter syndrome:

1. You are a generally competent person
2. There are always going to be people that know more about a certain area of data science than you *and that's ok and expected.* Even more importantly: you're not the smartest person in the planet, so if you look hard enough you're going to find people that are better than you at everything you do *and that's ok.*
3. You have a finite amount of time to learn things, and your goal shouldn't be to learn the most, but to learn the things that maximize your specific goals - generally, this is going to be career advancement, but for some it may be something else. 

In that order.

I think that, generally, imposter syndrome shows up in a thought cycle that goes the opposite direction. That is:

1. You don't have enough time to learn something you want to learn.
2. You look around and see that there are other people that know that thing you don't have time to learn
3. You feel incompetent

So when you feel that, flip it: 

1. Remind yourself that you are a competent person - if you weren't, you wouldn't have gotten to the position you are in right now, whether that's graduating from college or leading a data science team (yes, even DS team leaders catch the 'drome from time to time).
2. Remind yourself that when you look for people who know more than you about a specific area, you are guaranteed to find them - that's just how it works. People choose to specialize in certain areas, and if you only focus on that area of expertise, you are going to feel inadequate. But even more importantly, recognize that if you run into someone who is better than you at literally everything you do, that doesn't diminish your value - it just means you have run into someone that is pretty special\*
3. Get back to prioritizing what to learn. Do you *need* to learn that or do you just *want* to learn it to feel better about yourself? If the latter, learn to let it go, and focus on the things you need to learn - and save the things you want to learn for when you have the time, which will come.

\* As an anecdote - my first encounter with this scenario was a professor that literally did everything I liked doing - but better. He was a tenured professor at a top school, he had come \*this\* close to being a professional soccer player, and he was a classically trained musician, was in incredibly shape for his age and was a generally charming dude. I was a fumbling grad student who played recreational soccer poorly and played in a shitty metal band that no one ever went to see play, out of shape and generally a not-so-charming dude. 

It made me *incredibly* self-conscious for about a minute until I realized ""wait up... this guy is just an abject abnormality of humanity. I shouldn't feel bad about myself, I should just be impressed by how smart and accomplished this guy is *because 99.99999% of the population would be looking up at him too"".*

That helped me later in life when I would encounter people who I felt were just fundamentally smarter people than me. In particular, I remember hiring someone for my team that was so smart and thinking ""there is a better chance that I am going to be working for her in 10 years than the other way around"" *and being ok with that.*",Imposter syndrome and prioritizing what to learn,1615990949

datascience,"I’m learning about RMSProp, and have read about it quite widely around the web, but am finding the explanations lacking on one key detail (TL;DR in the title, lol).

It’s clear that the whole point of RMSProp is to replace a static learning rate with a dynamic learning rate that is a function of the size of the derivative. Because in RMSProp you divide the learning rate by the (square root of the moving average of the square of the) gradient, the effect of this on the learning rate is to grow it when the derivative is small and shrink it when the derivative is large. This helps to slow down learning (i.e., weight update steps) as the model approaches local minima, because the function is flatter and thus gradients smaller in these regions.

That’s all fine and good, but why square the gradient? Looking over the equation, wouldn’t the same effect happen if we just used the gradient *without* squaring it? Is it just that we want to make small gradients even smaller? Or is it that positive and negative gradients would cancel each other out, and squaring fixes this? If the latter (i.e., squaring to avoid cancellation), why not just take the absolute value? AFAIK were not differentiating the RMSProp equation, so the discontinuity at y=0 characteristic of absolute values shouldn’t be a problem.

Relatedly, why take the square root when dividing the learning rate? Interpretability of the units isn’t important here like it is for variance vs, stdev in statistics, and the dynamic growing/shrinking of the gradient would occur just the same whether the took the square root or not.

datascience,"Suppose there is a university - students enroll at this university and after some time they either ""drop out"" (censoring) or successfully graduate from the university (event).

Suppose there is historical data that includes information about students (age, scholarship info, high school gpa, ethnicity, parents income, gender, etc.) and information about how long they studied at the university (either the total time between registration and graduation or the total time between registration and drop out).

I understand that for a new student, classical survival models (e.g. proportional hazards cox regression) can be used to predict :

1) the probability of the student graduating given that the student has already been enrolled at the university for a certain amount of time (i.e. survival function)

2) the instantaneous ""hazard"" that the student graduates a specific time (i.e. the hazard function).

My question relates to a more generic scenario : can a survival model be used to predict the probability that a given student ""exits the university"" (successfully or unsuccessfully), having been enrolled at the university for a given amount of time? Whether the student leaves with a diploma or without a diploma is now immaterial - we are just interested in analyzing when the student will leave the university.

Can someone please tell me if this makes sense?

Thanks

datascience,"Hello,

After googling the similar concept without success, I wrote a simple magic that will automate the cell -&gt; reusable function process. I wish to hear your opinion of how you guys reuse the code in Jupyter notebook.

# Long story

There is one thing that has bothered me for a while is to reuse the cell in Jupyter notebook. For example, I write some data processing code in a cell then realize that I need to parameterize a few variables and do a case study (for optimization or visualization). 

Usually what I do is to copy and paste the code to a new cell and change the necessary parts. This is bad for maintainability. For example, if I need to apply a modification I have to apply it to every copy. Also, the variable name conflict will overwrite the previous result. I have to refactor a lot of code to ensure the two versions can work in parallel. 

Wrapping the cell as a function is the way to go, but debugging a function in Jupyter is much more difficult due to the variable scope and lack of robust debugging tools (it's getting better though). So, what I usually do is to first write the code in the cell. After everything is working, I put the function header, indent the code, write the return line and this cell becomes a function. Later when the function doesn't work properly, I comment out the header and return lines, then remove the indent, and start over from the pure cell code again.

What I have been wishing for, is something like ""cell arguments"" that allows a cell to be reused like a function, by passing in a few arguments that override the behavior. Therefore, I create this tool that ""functionize"" a cell as a function so that it could be called later with the specified arguments. 

I would like to see your opinion about reusing the cell and reducing code duplication in Jupyter notebook. 

Thank you!",A simple Jupyter/IPython magic extension to help reuse the cell,1615938136
datascience,"Say I have 2 time series A and B.
A is a time series of year-on-year growth numbers at quarterly intervals (I don't have the index levels). For example a data point as at 30-Sep-20 of +17.7% represents the year on year growth from 30-Sep-19.

B is a time series of total returns of a stock at quarterly intervals. A data point as at 30-Sep-20 of +10% represents the total return 3 months to 30-Sep-20.

If I wanted to test whether A is a leading indicator of B using a granger causality test or test if there is a relationship between the 2 time series, what would be the best way to make both series comparable?

Does it make sense to turn the time series of year-on-year growth numbers into an index starting from 100? Can think of it as a seasonally adjusted index.

Or should the share price returns also be converted into year-on-year numbers. Ie do time series analysis by converting B into a time series of year-on-year stock returns.

Apparently, 40 people in Europe out of 17 million got leg and lung blood clots after having a COVID vaccine, and some people are concerned.

I looked up the rate of blood clots, and the CDC says that it’s about 1-2 people per 1000 per year for general blood clots. Let’s assume that leg and lung clots make up the majority of these. To simplify, lets conservatively say that there’s a 1 in a thousand chance anyone will get a blood clot in a year’s time.

My background is mainly in Pure Math and Statistics, and I’m currently trying to focus on learning Python, MySQL, and R as well as grinding leetcode on the side. 

What should I do to stand out more? 

Also, given the current situation, I don’t think I can find any good internship so I decided to do a research term with a math prof this upcoming summer. Would this be a bad idea or at least partially useful in data science at all? 

Moreover, if anyone can give me tips on learning Python, MySQL, and grinding leetcode, that would be very beneficial to me. 

Thanks in advance!",Advice for undergrad to land data science internship.,1615870027

datascience," Hello professionals,  I am currently a Junior and will graduate a year early with a double major in Business Administration (took a couple of analytic courses) and Marketing this year. I will pursue a Master’s of Science in Applied Analytics for the 2021 academic year beginning in September with planning on graduating in September of 2022. Right now I am taking coding and data science courses online to prepare me for my grad program. Also, since I am graduating early my resume does not have really any work experience because I would spend my summers in class all day. The tools that have used are Tableau, JMP, Raptor, Basics of HTML, SQL, Excel, and Powerpoint. My goal out of my master's program is to have a data scientist, product manager, or data analytics job, but I would prefer being a data scientist. I am located in Iowa, would it still be possible to get a summer internship in data-related fields on the east or west coast (hopefully the bay area) to give me more experience, or is it too late. If possible I would love for a brief opportunity to connect with people in this group to learn about what you do, seek different opinions and tips, possible potential summer internship opportunities in data and analytics, as well as seeking additional networking options. I love to learn and meet new people and learn about what you do and the path you took to get you to where you are today. Hope to hear back from some of you I appreciate all your opinions and feedback!",Hello! seeking opinions and feedback,1615867215

datascience,"I am currently a junior in high school. 

I have always loved computer science and have been programming for the last 2 years or so. I always thought I would want to become some sort of SWE. Then I took AP Statistics... I have never found a course at school so interesting and I am blown away by the real-world application of statistics.

So I sort of combined the two interests and did some research and figured out that Data Science is a good balance. I still get to use code, but I don't have to code all day and develop carpal tunnel before I turn 30. I get to use statistics. I get to discover and have a real-world impact. I get to talk to people and clients. Everything seems like a perfect fit.

I need some advice in terms of a college plan. I live in Ohio and have looked at various schools around here. **Ohio State offers a bachelor's degree in Data Analytics**. However, students say that the program is pretty selective and it's not guaranteed I would get into it if I went to that school. 

The most common thing I see in schools around here is they **only** offer **a master's in data science**. In that case, I would most likely get some sort of bachelor's in computer science then move on to a master's in data science. 

So I guess the questions at hand are: **What do you guys recommend? Is a master's worth it/necessary?**

datascience,"Came down the pipe at work today, “CEO was at a conference and another CEO was talking about how they ‘stole’ customers from bigger industry players by looking into customer transactions and tailoring products and services to them to attract them over.” (Financial industry so these are transactions in and out of one company that are being munged). The thing is, we don’t have decades of preserved customer data, we don’t even have a data warehouse of any sort. Just some old clunker of a legacy hierarchical database that’s meant for acting as the data layer of a transactional system. Now our CEO wants to basically know who of our customers has certain account types at other companies based on our “data” because of something he heard at a conference that another company was doing. There is no way we’re mining our trivially available data and coming to any conclusions or assumptions about our customers financial business with other companies. 

This isn’t the first time our CEO has done this. A year or so ago he wanted a full travel prediction system built like Chase or Cap1 has for his credit cards there that automatically know when he’s traveling (so he claims). Everyone else in the company licks his boots except me, and I’m always the one coming off as the ass shooting these ridiculous demands down (yes I’m looking for a new job, no I haven’t had an interview in 2 years now while looking, I’m tired of people telling me this as the answer to my problems). The other day it was, “we’ll use prebuilt AI and just give it data and see what it finds.”

datascience,"This is for the **University of Bristol** in the UK and both courses are very similar except for 3 module changes:

* Technology, Innovation, Business, and Society (TIBS) -&gt; Introduction to Financial Technology
* Text Analytics -&gt; Introduction to Data Analytics
* Visual Analytics -&gt; Advanced Financial Technology

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly find the modules with a financial focus more interesting and closer to what I want to do in my career but I'm a bit put off with the name of the course as to me it implies that Data Science isn't as big a component of the course despite only 3 modules being different.

[This is the course](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/RouteStructure.jsa?byCohort=N&amp;ayrCode=21%2F22&amp;programmeCode=4COSC001T) I'm just stressing over this so much as I've received an offer for the Data Science course but asked to switch, now I'm having doubts and thinking maybe I should email to cancel the switch before they go ahead with it :/",Does the title of a Data Science masters matter? I can either study MSc Data Science or MSc Financial Technology with Data Science,1615852966
