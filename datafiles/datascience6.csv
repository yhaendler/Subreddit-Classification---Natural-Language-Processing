datascience,"Hello Data Science community,

Going to try to keep it as short as possible while providing relevant information. To start, a bit about my background… I graduated with a BS in Petroleum Eng and did well in school. Been more than a year and still having a difficult time landing an engineering position without any experience.

At this point, I’ve been recommended by many people to start a masters program but I’m having a hard time deciding what to pursue. Some have told me to go into MS data science, maybe an online program while i continue to search for an opportunity. This would allow me to move into tech or any other industry when the oil industry goes to shit. Few others have recommended to pursue Masters in Mechanical or Chemical Engineering which would open more opportunities.

I've really been leaning towards a masters in Data Science as it would complement my undergrad degree. The Oil and Gas industry is already heading into automation and heavily utilizing data science to significantly cut costs in this competitive environment. I'm having a difficult time deciding if I should pursue a MS in data science (preferably an online program at Berkeley/Georgia Tech) or go for a Masters in Chem/Mech Engineering and learn data science on the side through certifications. 

If you could share some suggestions or insights on this matter, I’d really appreciate it. Thank you all in advance.

hope this is okay in here - I know it's more analytics than anything. Basically, I'm trying to visualize geographical Data stored in google sheets. The problem is the data is inconsistent - sometimes will say Netherlands, sometimes Amsterdam, sometimes Europe.  


I have figured out a way for the map to ignore data that is too generic (i.e Europe), and have discovered that if you just have the city (e.g. Amsterdam) then it automatically treats that as a country. However, when I have both 'Netherlands' and 'Amsterdam' as inputs, it only reads one of those and ignores the other. I'm trying to see if there is a way to automatically recognize both the city and country and display both on the map, or even a formula/script that picks up and re-allocates the city as the relevant country.

datascience,"I will be interviewing for a data analyst position that works closely with the data science, BI and data engineering teams. The job requirement expects me to know some of the following:

• creating BI reports (very familiar with this)
• providing insights for the company (retail industry)
• explore various types of data sets
• showing ROI
• “understanding” data mining concepts, algos and statistical modeling
• development of semantic layer 
• predictive modeling (language not specified)
• Redshift, Aurora, SQL
• S3 and EC2
• Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark

Apart from the above mentioned tools, the job does not specify language requirements. Is the assumption that all analysis / data viz libraries can be used through python? I know SQL and Python well, however I want to be prepared for these requirements accordingly. I am not sure if I will be tested during the interview or not, but I will meet multiple teams and have to talk about these points. 

How can I familiarize myself with data exploration and manipulation through big data tech such as Redshift and Aurora? I have not used them before, and am unsure of what I need to know beforehand. 

Finally, can anyone expand on building a semantic later? I have designed them and provided them to engineering teams in my previous roles, but never developed it myself.",Data Analyst Interview,1579765249

datascience,"Hi all - 

I am a data scientist at tech startup. I am a member of this subreddit on my regular account, but I am using an anonymous account for obvious reasons. 

My small company right now is pitching to investors to raise another round of capital. Today the chief of staff asked me to make histogram plots from our database that they are using to pitch to investors. 

The problem is that these histogram plots are being used to make a pitch to investors that I know is factually not statistically certain or correct or academically honest at all. 

I made this clear to the CEO, the data science manager, and the chief of staff, and presented an alternative (and real) story about how we use our data - they all turned it down, saying the real story is too complex. The chief of staff straight up said that how they message with investors doesn't have to reflect how we are using our data in real life to maintain our informational advantage in the marketplace.

I'm kind of stumped right now and need some insight into helping me make a major decision in shaping my career future in Data Science.  
Just a little background of myself before I start.  
	\- Based in Canada  
	\- Have 2 years of being a Data Analyst under my belt  
	\- Have completed a Business degree at UBC with a GPA of 3.7/4.0  
	\- Have a bit of knowledge in coding specifically in Java and Dr Racket (I've done a few uni courses on these areas). Not familiar with Python or R.  
	\- Have good knowledge in SQL, have a year of experience using it in work as well as learning it through a uni course  
	\- Have 2 years of work experience using Data Visualization tools, Power BI &amp; Tableau  
	\- Have only the foundational knowledge in Stats. Just Stats I &amp; II. No knowledge in Linear Algebra.  
My goal:  
	\- Get into a data science(preferred)/data analyst position in FANG(Google etc) in the U.S. in the quickest way possible.  
To start, I'm not sure if I should shed USD 90k on a master's degree in data science from Berkeley or should I just self-learn data science tools and Machine learning?    
TLDR on the reasons why I'm choosing Berkeley over other programs is:  
	\- It's online/remote. I can work while taking it  
	\- It's from a prestigious school. This matters to me.  
	\- Help me get my quantitative knowledge(Stats, Algebra) up to pace.  
	\- I'm genuinely interested in Data Science/Machine Learning.  
	\- I don't want to waste my undergrad GPA.  
\- Majority of the people who work at Google, for instance, are from Stanford and Berekely

	1. Do you think with the 2 years as a Data Analyst be enough to qualify me for interviews for Data Science positions if I also self-learned the material myself?  
	2. Should I be spending USD 90k for a master's in data science?

I have a dataframe which looks like this:

    +----------+------------+-------------+----------+--------+-------+----------+
    |    id    |    name    |  predicted  |  actual  |   inc  | payout|yyyy_mm_dd|
    +----------+------------+-------------+----------+--------+-------+----------+
    |    215   |     Nir    |     100     |   200    |   100  |   1   |2020-01-04|

    |    215   |     Nir    |     120     |   220    |   100  |   1   |2020-01-03|

The above is stripped a bit, my actual dataframe has daily data for all of 2020, with 60 ids per day. `inc` is a result of `actual` - `predicted` and `payout` is 1% of `inc`. Here is the logic for how I have handled this:

    df['inc'] = df['actual'] - df['predicted']    
    df['payout'] = np.where(df['inc']&gt;=1, (df['inc'] / 100) * 1, 0)

I want the `payout` column to be 1% of `inc` but only after the monthly sum of `predicted` is passed by the monthly sum of `actual`, otherwise the `payout` should be 0.

I.e. 25 days into January, the sum of `actual` passes the sum of `predicted` for all of January, from then on I want to count 1% of the difference. Anything before should be 0.

`predicted` has values until 2020-12-31, while `actual` only has data up until the current day and is NaN for future dates.

Here is how the output might look if the total `predicted` for January was 1000.

    +----------+------------+-------------+----------+--------+-------+----------+
    |    id    |    name    |  predicted  |  actual  |   inc  | payout|yyyy_mm_dd|

datascience," Hello fellow redditors, I've started lurking in relevant subreddits for my career, mostly /r/cscareerquestions and [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/). Today, I'd like to ask for your help.

My current situation: I'm a student from Germany and finished my bachelor's degree with a GPA of \~3.6 (1.4 in German grading system). I studied Business Informatics / Information Systems, which has like 1/3 computer science, 1/3 economics and 1/3 of information systems (think of business process modeling, knowledge management, development of application systems (waterfall model, scrum etc.)). Right now, I'm doing a gap year where I'm doing two internships (these are usually not done for job offers but for work experience) before I want to start my master's degree. Since I did two courses in data analytics, I started liking this topic a lot and also wrote my thesis about a data science topic where I analyzed a dataset in R.

Initially, I planned to do a data science master abroad but reading a lot about the career opportunities of data scientists on Reddit I'm not so sure anymore. I'm reading more and more that these programs are cash grabs and are created because of student demands, while there are actually not that many jobs for inexperienced data scientists.

While I had fun with statistics and aced these courses in university, I don't have a hardcore math/stats background and also not a CS background. I like the application and comprehension of models on a higher level but not really the maths stuff. But on Reddit, you basically read that this is absolutely essential as a data scientist and everybody recommends a statistics degree. So I'm also not sure if I should pursue this path. I also tried to pick up elements of statistical learning, which seems to be a must-read for aspiring data scientists, but I couldn't really get into it. It was too difficult for me.

Right now, I'm also thinking of just continuing my degree in Information Systems (I don't think there really is an equivalent in the US, at least I don't know of one) since I also really like most of the IT topics. For a project in my current internship, I'm designing the system architecture and the API specification and also develop a web application (frontend in Angular, backend in node.js). At another internship, I was part of a data warehouse project where we were the link between software development and the business, basically translating the business requirements to the developers and assure that it's implemented correctly. This meant creating test data and validating correct ETL processes. 

Most Information Systems master degrees also offer some data analytics courses. The ones I took at my university were also from the master's program. My second internship will also be at a data science consultancy where I will code in R most of the day.

What would you do in my situation? I really like to work with data but this career path seems kind of ""insecure"" compared to being more generalistic in IT.",Should I pursue a data science master or choose another career path?,1579706760
