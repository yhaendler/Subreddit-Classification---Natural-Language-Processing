datascience," 

I have 3 years exp Tech Support, a year of SQL DBA, and 1.5 yr Teradata DBAMy role is currently in hybrid mode, which is Teradata DBA, Administering Business Objects/Tableau, and on-prem. deploying and configuring ETL process

For all of those roles, I've been also in support of grabbing internal tickets, which I really hate it nowI also hate the fact how I need to be on the roster for call/weekend duties

I recently tried on my own to check out devops role and while trying to fix issues in Maven, I found out how I am losing patience and wasting this long hour trying to find out the issue

I know the current pandemic delays and gives less chance to get selected, but perhaps my strength is chasing up with people and talking to different teams so that makes me suited with Project Coordinator before reaching PM? or Business Analyst? I want to lean more toward less technical management and decision making. Data Analyst (downgrading from a DBA)? Data Scientist? (But DS are mainly people with math, stats, algorithm background isn't it?) Digital Analyst in Marketing? PreSales Solution Engineer? UI Dev? (I researched, but Front-End is more rewarding by what people say?)

Either way, I keep applying for the roles, but I assume I keep getting rejected since I don't have any solid experiences in neither of them

What are some recommended roles, which can suit me by the sound of what I explained above and hopefully where I won't downgrade myself in terms of salary and the level? or

I'm very confused like a kid who's lost in a forest, panicking and not sure which way to keep walking ahead, especially since I've been WFH for over half a year, stuck at home.

I really want to resign from my current place, but I'm not getting a picture for some of the roles I need to keep applying for since I keep getting rejected.

It'll mean a lot to me the more feedback I get so I can narrow it down

datascience,"My life is a bit of a mess, I didn't have a good time studying in university (social issues and fell into depression) and ended up being pushed into courses I didn't really take interest in, in order to be able to still obtain my degree. As so I wasted many years as well and will be graduating at the end of next year.

I came across data science at the end of last year and took an instant liking to it- coding in Java was a passion of mine in high school. I managed to gain admission to a private data science tertiary institute for a 6 month program at the beginning of this year and excelled at it. I am still studying, in my free time, the deeper statistics behind it in order build a better foundation.

My concern this whole time is not being able to gain a good job as a data scientist due to not having a masters in a quantitative field. I did do commerce courses in my first year which included stats and maths, however, that obviously isn't sufficient.

I applied for an internship a few months back at a startup data science company I am very interested in. After no word from them for about two months, I received an email telling me to submit my CV on a certain site. After doing so, I didn't get a response for another two months. When I finally did get the response it said I needed to do a screening test to gauge my skills.

This put me in a slight state of panic as all I knew was that the test was in python and I had 2 hours to complete it. What I feared the most was that the internship was titled as ""Software Engineering"" and me being a data science would have difficulty if the test was bias towards heavier programming. I should say now that the company is mostly data scientists so I think they may have used that as an umbrella term. I also needed to do the test ASAP as I want the company to see me as being interested.

After a day and a half of studying, I took the test. There were three sections; the first I think i got 100%, the second I had sound code but had an issue getting the import module to work in tests IDE so it didn't compile, the third I managed to get half the program working (compiled but needed a second loop to get the correct output). 

What annoyed me, but was objectively fair, about the test is that it was based off problem solving in python (string and list manipulation). Whereas I was expecting something a little more to do with data interpretation and manipulation. 

I am so worried now about how this will play out, I saw this internship as a gateway to a future job through experience, so that I would be judged less on my background qualifications.

I really don't know how to feel about this, the test did say they will be checking the code for good coding so hopefully they will see I managed to do something but I'm worried they won't bother to look if other applicants did very well.",I didn't do well on my data science internship screening test,1602701968

I'm pretty sure it was python based and (I think) used tampermonkey extension to get the information 

I used a custom made tool once that would basically flip through webpages and take values from defined fields on those pages and then throw that information into columns on a sheet that we'd then manipulate manually.

The tool I used looked something like this:

* Already logged into the CMS -&gt; Execute the tool/script that would then automatically open an order in a new window
* It'd then go through that order and take values from specific fields and then copy those values in a sheet
* It'd then close the window and proceed on to the next order in the specified range
* Once it completes the specified (date) range, the columns would be something like salesperson / order number / sale amount / attachment amount / etc - to then be manually manipulated, no further automation needed (beyond the formulas in the sheet)

datascience,"I work as a pricing analyst in an insurance company and use SAS Enterprise Guide GLM to model motor insurance claim frequency and claim size. My understanding is very basic, but given the existing pricing benchmark, I was able to add value by adding some obvious independent variables such as suburb density, distance from CBD, census statistics etc. I do some basic data checks, data bandings, pick poison for claims frequency or gamma for claim size, and then just pick the independent variables that have reasonable p values and makes logical sense.

What I don't understand or do poorly is:
* Dealing with missing data within an observation  
* Data checks before proceeding to the modelling stage
* How to use the results to generate predictions for claims frequency/size for any given observation
* How to apply the model results on a training dataset (the third of claims experience not used in the model)
* Understanding how to interpret the model outputs other than the p value

\- 5+ years programming in matlab for physics and engineering simulations including: Monte Carlo integration, stochastic modelling (e.g. Brownian motion, random walks, Geometric Brownian motion, stochastic differential equations, Poisson processes), numerical solution to partial differential equations (e.g. using Crank-Nicolson and split-step methods, solving Fokker-Planck equations), regression analysis on univariate data using n-polynomials, and linear algebra

\- Some experience with C and Python programming (can do most of the same things I do in matlab but with a bit more work), including the Numpy and matplotlib modules. For C (C99 upwards) I created my own libraries for linear algebra and numerical integration, which I compile with gcc on my macbook

\- Basic experience of Linux with the unix shell (e.g. making directories, copying files, installing packages/modules, running code through compilers)

\- 3+ years of management experience (mainly in administrative roles, leading teams of tutors, interviewing/recruiting/training employees, etc)

I've done some machine learning projects in school, using some of the classic M.L. data sets, e.g. the ones offered by Scikit.

**Project information:**  
I've got hundreds of thousands of rows of data, spread across close to a hundred variables in our CRM system - I assume/predict that more than 80-90% of these variables are completely irrelevant for my purpose though. 

**Data types:**  
Most variables are binary (e.g. TRUE/FALSE) or multi-class (e.g. A, B, C, D, E), a few variables are continuous. 

**Class attribute:**  
I have a binary variable, ""customer\_lost"", that I will use as my class attribute, although it is drastically overweighted (90% NO, 10% YES). 

**MY QUESTIONS:**

1. What type of model would be best suited for this project? Logistic regression? Random Forest?
2. Given that I have almost 100 variables, is there a straightforward way to determine which variables I should use in my model, or do I need to use all of them?
3. Do I need to re-balance my data so that, in the training data, I have equally many ""NO"" and ""YES"" in the class attribute?
