So, I like reading books, and have managed to read more than a few books so far, my latest being 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep'. But what I observed when I completed this book, and many others in the past('1984' by Orwell and 'The Trial' by Kafka are good examples) is that after I am done reading, I can't seem to remember much of the book. I can't seem to critically analyse the book after or even draw a conclusion from it at the time, however hard I try to think. Looking up reviews online to understand it better makes me feel like I'm not thinking on my own too, and usually they don't give me anything new, always something I already have or a variation if what I had thought of.

Crichton originally wrote this book in 1969. And the most wonderful aspect of this book (apart from the brilliant story) is its scientific accuracy. Being in the 6th semester, we've come across almost all the topics discussed in TAS— Microbiology, Biochemistry, Enzymology, Biophysics, Immunology...and it is correct in its assessment everytime.

Another beauty is Crichton's ability to blend in fact and fiction in such a way that it would seem as if it is actually happening, in real time. At moments I held my breath for as long as 20-25 seconds.

books,"Overall I would say I enjoyed it, but there were just a couple of things that annoyed me a bit. The timeline of the events at the beginning seemed a bit confusing at times. I didn't really get a sense of how much time had passed since YT and Hiro met and the larger events of the story started. Honestly, that kept bugging me a bit, because I felt that I couldn't really gauge how well YT and Hiro knew each other and what they had been doing together. When I read the acknowledgements and learned the book was supposed to be a graphic novel the jumps did make a bit more sense. I think they would have come across better in a graphic novel than they did in just written format. 

With regard to Hiro and YT, I have to say that I far preferred YT. I liked her spunk and because we get to see her in several settings, including her relationship with her mother, I felt her personality came across a lot more than Hiro. Hiro very much felt a bit slippery and aloof. He kept getting away with everything, which is not necessarily a problem in itself but it didn't really give me the feeling that I was getting to know the character. The swords were pretty cool. The thing is though that I felt I got a better sense of who for example Uncle Enzo and Raven were than with Hero at times. Granted Uncle Enzo and Raven fit a few tropes, so less explanation was necessary for me to get what motivated them. 

So I went into this book expecting Cyberpunk... and I got Cyberpunk, but I hadn't really expected the religious links he put in the book. That is totally on me, because I didn't even read the blurb before starting the book.  It all makes sense in the world he created and I do think he explained all the connections well, but it just kept pulling me out of the story because I kept thinking that this what not what I had expected at all. I liked how he wove the ancient in with the cyberpunk, to create the idea that events in the present (or future) can still be linked to the ancient. I do wish he had included a bit more of L. Bob Rife.

books,"I just wanted to write down and fully codify something I've been thinking about for a while.  

&amp;#x200B;

I read a lot of romantic fiction, and a staple of the genre is the Big Romantic Gesture, something which is presented as romantic in context but would be problematic in reality.  Some of the more famous examples are things like Edward watching Bella in her sleep, guys pursuing women after being told 'no', the lack of explicit consent and safe bdsm in 50 Shades (which I haven't actually read, but it's a solid example), and so on.  These things work in fiction because we know the two characters are ""meant to be""; they truly love one another, and they won't hurt the other, and so on, all things that we don't know in real life without explicit discussions about it.   When a man pursues a woman past her rejecting him multiple times, that's going to be a huge problem except like the one time in a million where he actually is her True Love and she was rejecting him because, I don't know, she thinks she's not good enough for him, she's being blackmailed by his ex, she's been sent to spy on him by her controlling father, etc.  But, the 'agreement' we have with the authors of this work is that the work is set in that one in a million universe where it *is* okay.  And, because it *is* fiction, it's not reality, we know *we're* safe - we can just close the book if we don't like what's portrayed.  The consent for the actions exist between the author and the reader, not between the characters.   It's like a fantasy - you know consent exists and that you're safe, so, I think, most people don't think about how the people they're fantasising about know they have one another's consent.  And, of course, many people have fantasies in which consent is explicitly not present, which, imo, is totally fine because it's happening entirely in their own head.  Every real person present is consenting to what's happening.

&amp;#x200B;

I think, where this becomes a problem is when people read these works (or watch, since it also happens in movies) and don't understand that they're fantasies that can't happen in reality because, in reality, you need to *know* that consent exists and that the other person is into it.  In reality, you don't have a creator-given guarantee that that's the case, and the other person can't just close the book if they're not enjoying it.  *You*, for example, is a deconstruction of this.  Joe thinks he's in one of those books/movies/shows, in which the ""made to be"" exemption is present, but he's not - he's in a more gritty, realistic genre where other people have reactions which are closer to reality than are portrayed in romantic fiction.  The movie *He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not* is similar deconstruction - &gt;!the female lead has a mental illness which leads her to believe her love for a total stranger is returned.  !&lt;  

&amp;#x200B;

I think acknowledging this is important, because terrible, terrible things can happen if someone takes these sorts of stories as a model for real behaviour.  I think that's a part of the outcry against Twilight - because it was being read by young girls who didn't necessarily have the life experience to understand why this sort of thing needs to remain fiction - and 50 Shades - because lots of people don't have experience of safe BDSM, leaving the unsafe behaviour in the book as their only idea of how it should work.  I think it's important to be explicit about what's fun and romantic to read or daydream about, but which would be less enjoyable if it happened in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't necessarily think these books/movies - as in, the romance genre as a whole - need to stop existing or that they all need to be rewritten to be more realistic.  Though, that being said, a lot of newer stories do have characters explicitly talk about consent when it comes to sex (though not necessarily for the big romantic gestures or the pursuing past a no), which is a nice improvement.  One complaint I've seen about asking about consent is that it ""ruins the mood"" - which, I suspect, is another effect of taking these stories as models for reality - and showing that it can be as simple as asking ""are you into this?"" or ""do you want me to ----?"" is an important thing for people to know.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought of making this post because I recently proposed to my boyfriend, after an explicit discussion about whether we wanted to get married.  The act of proposing was a surprise, in terms of timing and style, but the fact that a proposal was coming (and what the answer would be) wasn't.  Because I just went through that I've been engaging more with other people who are thinking of proposing - including looking at a few videos of proposal fails on youtube - and it seems that lots of people still have the idea that a truly romantic proposal must be a total surprise.  I think that's an example of the sort of thing which is fun as a fantasy, or to read about happening to fictional characters who we know are ""meant to be"", but which is a bad model for how to go about things in real life.  Personally, I think if one person is truly, completely, surprised that the other is thinking they're ready to be married, that's indicative of some issues they should be talking about.  It took me about 10 years to realise that - in my teens and early twenties, I also thought that was romantic and what 'should' happen.","Romantic Fiction and the ""Meant to Be"" exemption",1582899503
books,"and this was after a degree in Computer Science Engineering. I got a decent job and I live in a different city, away from my parents and I believe this is the decision I made for myself not seeking advice from anyone. 

Ever since fifth grade, I always had the idea of Studying English Literature systematically. We had Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn stories as lessons in the school and I fell in love with Mark Twain. But I didn't dare tell my parents about this as they always wanted me to be an Engineer. I did my CS degree, got a nice job, and I earn a fair amount of money and most importantly I have more time now to do whatever I want. Pursuing Literature in the country I live, might lead to teaching careers and they're not really well paid. So I had to keep my head down in choosing the subjects in the college. 

Two years after joining the job, and after making my presence felt at the work, I decided to pursue English Literature Masters through distance education. This is the day I got my admission letter with course books and details about the curriculum. Also, they've asked me send the first assignment on one of my favorites Robinson Crusoe. I couldn't be more happier and when the course books arrived, I opened the package with an ecstatic feeling and my mother actually said, ""You look really happy after a long time"". 

I would be studying British Literature, American Literature and Indian Literature in the next two years and I want to savour every moment of that. I've decided not to use any Internet sources for notes or quick summaries(spark notes, cliffs notes etc etc) and made a resolution to put maximum efforts into this.  For the first year overview paper, I'm considering a in depth analysis on Harry Potter or His Dark Materials. Hope everything goes smoothly :)

I wait at the base that was here last time I visited, but that was nearly ten years ago. It arrived on week thirty that year, but this time week thirty has passed; passed months ago and I feel maybe time isn’t flowing right – has it really been fifty weeks? I can see it approaching but it just won’t stretch to the finish line, it’s been moving but it seems tired. The others have left and given up hope, they think it’ll never make it; I know it will, even if I have to help it, drag it across the finishing line. 
They packed their bags five weeks ago and left: Lomborg and Ebell and Monckton and the rest. It’s not coming anytime soon, they said, so we’re going home. I knew they would abandon us, I can’t get it to come faster to show them no matter how hard I try. Maybe it’ll come tomorrow, I think, knowing full well it won’t. It has to crawl here, it just has to, I can’t help it across on my own - the others, I needed their help, but they have given up long ago, before they even got here maybe. 
It’s stopped forever maybe, no it can’t have. Nothing is forever, not me not them not this. Everything changes but not everything should change the way it does; some things are destined and some are altered like someone might spike a drink to do the worst for their own gains. I will stay here until it comes, I’ll pull it on my own even if they say one person can’t, because I know I’m not alone completely.
There are hundreds of me, thousand, across the world and each of them waits at the finish line, preparing to help the racer limp further than it can right now, because we’ve seen them do it before. I take my rope from my bag of dreams and begin to hike up. When I get there I plant a hook in deep, letting it know I haven’t given it up, that I still believe we can all make it in the end. I tie the rope around my waist and begin to run, to pull, to ache and strain and yank until I feel a movement; I hear it too. I look to my left and they’re there, the thousands, soon to be millions, pulling with me. 
We pull together and the finish line is in sight, the base from all those years ago when I had been here and even further when I had not. It takes hours, days, weeks, months, years; all made up of seconds of thoughts and impulses and hopes and dreams. The hopes become facts and eventually we do cross the finish line and there waiting are those who left, clapping and smirking – but we don’t stop. With an almighty burst of renewed energy we all pull further and further and the jaws of the smirker’s drop further and further. We keep pulling and pulling and our ropes stay firm and our hooks assure that we will not break lose and abandon the glacier, the world; we will keep going.",Pulling the World (An original piece inspired by the recent Antarctic 20% snow melt),1582898256

&gt;Emperor Mapidéré was the first to unite the island kingdoms of Dara under a single banner. But now the emperor is on his deathbed, his people are exhausted by his vast, conscriptive engineering projects and his counsellors conspire only for their own gain.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even the gods themselves are restless.  
&gt;  
&gt;A wily, charismatic bandit and the vengeance-sworn son of a deposed duke cross paths as they each lead their own rebellion against the emperor's brutal regime. Together, they will journey to the heart of the empire; witnessing the clash of armies, fleets of silk-draped airships, magical books and shapeshifting gods. Their unlikely friendship will drastically change the balance of power in Dara... but at what price?

A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many ""suggest some books"" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 * All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

 If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

books,"My friends my pals I am stunned by that final scene?! I'm still trying to collect my thoughts. &gt;!The violence that Peekay channels into his fight with the Judge (and what he did to the Judge's arm??) seems so graphically out of character from the young man he'd grown into.!&lt; I loved the storytelling and the development of Peekay's character but to me it seemed so.. abrupt and personally unsatisfying for the novel to end this way.  

The Judge was clearly fundamental to the development of Peekay's independent attitude and approach to life, but after all the love and physical/mental/emotional nurturing from so many others (Doc..

Since there is a lot of fantasy enthusiasts on this sub, I thought I'd share a passage that really struck a chord and brought back strong memories of that special feeling many of us had during our early years of reading fantasy. (no spoilers)

In his 2015 book, *Animal Money*, Michael Cisco wrote,

*When I was in my teens, I used to read fantasy books and project myself into them with a feeling that rivalled anything to be found in poetry. That is, it was a feeling that I could not analyze or name, but only rhapsodize about, unintelligibly. There was an upsweeping feeling of wild freedom expressed in terms of the opening of landscapes and of untrammeled movement in space. It resembled the surging of a tide, plains of tall grass, wind, launching into the air, the sight of distant mountains, the feeling of the weather. It felt like nakedness, sexual desire, a sexual desire to fly without dissolving into an eternally expanding landscape, and it also had something to do with music, especially music with a jewelled sound, if that makes sense. The sounds had a gleam at the higher pitches and a luster in the lower ones, and they struck me like vivid primary colors, contrasting without clashing. And there were precious metals in the sound as well, and glass or crystal sounds, very clear and pure but often with an exquisitely intolerable quality that was not beauty exactly, more like slicing. I associated that music with magic, and a magical liberty to unfold in an infinite planet consisting of superlatively beautiful natural vistas and intriguingly human enclaves, all strictly isolated from each other, so that there was no place in the whole world that felt hemmed in and hopeless, inescapable, not bordering sharply on a territory belonging to everything that could be imagined.*

*At the same time, there was a lacerating sadness that would well up in me around these fantasies, and that was no more comprehensible. Why did these fantasies all seem to spin into a terrible sense of loss even as they were at the apex of their existences? Why did they seem more real in the moment I first turned to them again, and seem to lose reality the further I went with them? How could I have such inchoate desires in the first place? It was not their unreality that depressed me, or that I ran from, but their reality rejected me. I was not real enough for them, or, even though I did manage, I can not explain how, to exist, I existed in some wrong way, not their way, not like them. The problem was, perhaps, that I had always to uphold that reality myself, and that not a single thing ever presented itself to me as objective in those fantasies. Like Atlas, I had to hold the whole thing up by my own unflagging effort, so nothing came to me except as a more or less disguised act of my own will. The world had none of the spontaneity, surprise, antipathy, that I consider the sine qua non of real experience. And yet, there are times when the imagination produces something without being asked, without being told, without any explanation, something so arbitrarily complete in itself and satisfying.*

I find that if I read fast, I can often knock out lots of books. But sometimes I'll ask myself what was that page about, and then I don't know how that might've played in the story. Seeing that the author spent so much time in creating that novel, it would feel a shame to not try to put myself in their shoes.
