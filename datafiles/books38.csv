books,"I finished reading Dune recently and I hate to admit this, but I found it quite boring. Week after week I see threads about “How great Dune is” on this subreddit and I’m trying to understand why people love it so much, but all the comments are the same: “amazing world building”, “so complex and detailed”, “the plot is so deep”, but I didn’t experience any of that...

(Trigger warning for Dune fans: what I’m about to say should be taken with a pinch of spice, as I have only read the first book, and these were my initial impressions. I am absolutely open to the possibility that I missed something, and if that’s the case then please help me understand it better.)

They go to a desert planet where water is hard to come by so they wear special suits to conserve water - that’s not exactly the most imaginative world building. There’s some fun magic, like Paul’s clairvoyance, but that’s also not ground breakingly interesting. And the plot just seems full of holes. The most valued substance in this universe comes from this planet, yet somehow these great houses completely underestimate an entire world’s population and don’t bother to either ally with them or at least spy on them to discover the true source of their beloved spice? 

Sorry if I am coming across as ignorant (I certainly am in this matter), but I am writing this because I would love to have my opinion changed. I’d like to know why this book is so great. What aspects of the world building are so phenomenal? What parts of the plot did you think were particularly intricate? Thank you to those who take the time to comment and educate me on the series!",What’s so great about Dune?,1593906812

When removing a book from a shelf, the ones nearby tend to fall into each other. This is a much bigger problem with taller and heavier books since they fall harder and have more weight/size to them. 

Is there such a product (or one that works as suchz even if not designed for it) that acts as a ""placeholder"" when removing a book from a shelf?

books,"Hello, I'm moving up to 8th grade and this summer break I've finally decided to start reading.

Here are some of the books I chose to read (all about \~200 pages)

* The Choice (Edith Eger) ^(finished reading)
* The Boys in the Boat (Young readers adaptation &amp; school recommended) ^(reading, 1/4 of the way in)
* Survival Guide for the Soul
* The Lord of the Flies

The Choice, it's a very therapeutic book about dealing with long term trauma and releasing yourself from blaming yourself for the things that you cannot change, the past..! The book took me quite a long time to finish since it was the first one I read. It was intriguing to see how each person in Eger's life heavily affects how she thinks and maintains herself, and also in the later parts of the book, each person she introduces teaches her something crucial to her process in supporting her traumatized clients. I also found the distinction between victimization and victimhood interesting because even though the two words feel the same, it contrasts between the others and the self. This book was definitely showed me how fun books can be to read and what it can teach us through words.

tbitb, so far I only read about 1/4 of it, but the book is in 3rd person and it's about Joe and his ""boat""'s journey through winning the gold medal in 1936, Berlin. I'm not too sure how the story will progress, but I feel that it will be a lot shallower than ""the choice"". It switches the ""main character"" quite often after each chapter, the pov changes. As of now, I don't have much thoughts about it other than ""it's a story about a person who had a difficult childhood.""

tlotf, Feels like I'm going to have to read this sometime in my future... might as well read it prior to that inevitable future....

sgfts, recommendation from family+church, sure, I have a lot of time,,, so why not.

I just want to talk about the difficulty, subject matter, and any thoughts on my *choice* of books

books,"First off, the ideas of both series are outstanding, the main thing that sets them apart, for me at least, is the characters. Now this is personal preference-of course-but, I think The Hunger Games has the best characters of any books ever; peta, Kantiss, Gale, President Snow, and many more whom can’t fit into my compressed list. While I love the Harry Potter characters; Harry, Ron, and Hermione are the first to cross most peoples minds. I think the supporting cast in the hunger games outclasses most books including Harry Potter by a mile. In addition, I think the love story in Hunger Games is a lot better. Many people wished that Harry and Hermione ended up together, but it was rarely ever talked about. While, we all knew Peta and Gale would HAVE to compete. And, as a whole I was very pleased with both books. But, in my opinion The Hunger Games&gt;Harry Potter.",Hunger games&gt;Harry Potter,1593895405

books,"I've written a book (Young Adult Fiction), which mainly focuses on the developing romance of the two main characters, but ends with them letting go of each other, and realizing that's the only choice they have (due to plot complications, they can't be together, but they still love each other)

I've read everywhere that this book would not be a romance since it doesn't end happily, is that compulsory? If this book isn't romance, what genre would it be? I seem to recall tons of fiction; Fault in Our Stars, La La Land, Five Feet Apart, etc, which don't end happily. What are they, if not romance?

**Edit: My book uses the concept of time travel to place the two characters, who technically should be years apart, in the same context, and thus they fall in love. My story is based on their love story, time travel is just a plot device to bring them together, and I'm unsure what category it is.**",Does all Romance need to end with a Happily Ever After?,1593892440
books,"I've revisited The Dice Man by Luke Rhinehart recently. It was a favourite of mine when I was in my early 20's. For those of you who don't know, it's basically about a dude who lives his life by rolling dice to make all of his decisions. It's very anti-establishment and a heck of a lot of fun... but I have to admit, on my recent reread it did feel a little more old fashioned than I remembered.

There are some super cool ideas in it, but some of the 'boundary' breaking decisions he makes aren't all as shocking as they might have seemed in the past.

So I was wondering, is it a book that's still finding an audience among younger readers? Or is this old man a part of the last generation who would've been impressed by it?",The Dice Man by Luke Rhinehart - Is it still finding new readers?,1593892205

books,"This book was amazing in helping me not only realize how my habits are formed but also double-check if the habits I have are good or if they had been building up over time without my realizing. 

I just finished the book so I'm still working on monitoring my habits and trying to form new ones. I don't even remember how I got this book but it was in the small book collection I have so I started reading it.

The biggest takeaway of course, is identifying the 1. cue 2. routine 3. reward. And knowing that you can't get rid of a habit but that you have to replace it with another. This is huge because my oldest brother has been smoking for about 15 years now, and he's tried to quit before but hasn't been successful. And I don't think he's trying to quit right now, but for next time that he tries, I can try suggesting him that instead of quitting smoking, he has to replace with a different habit and that it might take a few weeks or months for him to find a habit that'll give him the same satisfaction smoking does.

I'm not a smoker myself so I don't know what satisfaction he gets, the few times I've tried smoking, my lungs ended up hurting and I would get dizzy. So I don't know how other people do it but oh well, knowing how to suggest to someone how to ""quit"" (replace) smoking is good and I'm ready to test it out with my brother and see if it works. After all, it depends on him to do all the work, but hopefully I can persuade him.

As for myself, I want to start the habit of waking up early, at around 4-5am. It just makes me feel good and more relaxed the times I've done it. But recently I've had such a hard time waking up. I've been waking up at around 7-8am and even then I feel tired. Whereas when I would wake up early I would feel more energized but calmer as well. Right now, it always feel like I'm rushing through the day to do everything on time and it never gets done anyways. 

My office is messy most of the time, I have to work out after work, which I don't enjoy, I prefer to do it before because it gives me energy and makes me more relax knowing I don't have to do it later, when I'm already mentally tired from working.

For waking up early, I need to identify the 1. cue that's making me wake up later, how could I make myself or get that cue earlier? Which I do, I always wake up earlier at around 4am and have a hard time falling back asleep but for some reason, instead of waking up, I go back to bed and wake up later and even more tired.

My wife hated it and would make me feel bad about waking up extra early? Maybe that's why I started waking up later, for the peer pressure or just the feeling that I was doing something wrong but it made me feel so much better.

Maybe trying to get rid of that negative connotation is a good first step for me to start waking up early again. Even just writing it now makes me feel better and like it's a solid plan.

Instead of going back to bed at 4am when I wake up naturally, I'll just wake up and relax for a second, take some time to breath, do nothing, read a book, workout and get those things out of the way. Freeing up my time after work to do things I enjoy, like skateboarding, or playing an instrument, which I enjoy doing after work, but when I have to work out and read and clean, I don't have enough time.

From now on, I'll see waking up early as a good thing, even if nobody around me makes me feel that way but I'll do it because I enjoy it. And do all the little things, like just relaxing and thinking about life, planning out my day getting ready for work, etc.

We'll see how it goes, I'm excited and happy to have written this. Waking up early is good and helps me achieve more of the things that make me happy.",The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg,1593891294
