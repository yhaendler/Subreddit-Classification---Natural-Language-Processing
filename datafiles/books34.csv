books,"I'm wondering if this community can help me appreciate this novel from an angle I haven't approached yet (I'm sure there are many.) Maybe I should give the dust a chance to settle before posting here, but I want to talk about this while it's still raw and before I move on to the next venture.

Usually when I find that I don't care much for the book I'm reading, I simply put it down. However, my friends and I put together a little COVID-19 book club, somebody picked this book as our undertaking, and I have a bit of a stubborn streak. So I stuck with it.

I'm glad I can at least say I followed through, but the book was so exhausting for me to read. When I try to narrow down why that was the case, I come down to things like the style of prose and the pacing of the story and the progression of the characters. It just isn't in line with what I prefer to read, and I understand that is all subjective.

But I can't shake off the feeling like I am missing something critical. I think I have some pieces gathered, like Murakami's intense focus on breasts, or a certain character's seemingly apparent Oedipus complex, or the expression of sex as a passionless act, or the obvious (maybe lofty, even?) references to Orwell's 1984 and other meta commentary on literature, and so on, but I feel ashamed that despite having a degree in literature, I am struggling to put it all together (like another certain character, before his sudden demise.) Maybe I'm just a shitty reader.

I know could look this all up online and read what insights others have to offer, but I never posted in this community before and this seemed like a good time to step in and try to have a conversation before I go sleuthing.

books,"This year, I've lost count of how many books I've read (between 20-50). The year before, I hated books, I thought of them as boring and meaningless. I did not so great in school and I didn't really have any plans for my future. 

However, when I read ""the universe in a nutshell"" by Hawking, something got awakened in me. All of a sudden I fell in love with physics, I wanted more. I read two more books of him, ""A brief history of time"" and ""Brief answers to the big questions"", still couldn't get enough. I bought about ten books and spent the entire summer reading about physics and maths. Then while continuing these books, I started to read biology, philosophy, psychology, history and chemistry. I just couldn't get enough of facts and education. I wanted to learn more and more, I also started to take several pages worth of notes while reading. Without extra effort, my grades got higher, my social life got improved, I got into several new hobbies, I got a gf, and now I'm preparing to study physics. 

My overall happiness has improved a lot, and I have figured out who I am, what I want to do and what I stand for. This is all thanks to Stephen Hawking letting me know how great books are, and how fun it is to learn. Even though you're dead, thank you Hawking.",Stephen Hawking changed my life.,1592167925

books,"When RPO had been suggested as a next goal for our local book club, I was wary at first. I saw the film at the time of its release, and I remember leaving the cinema with a thought, ""If this were released when I was 13, it'd be an instant all-time favourite of mine"", but that impression was born out of pure joy of recognizing a number of background characters and the overall gaming atmosphere. So, I expected the book to be something similar - light-hearted, casual, maybe even aimed at kids, and full of tributes to modern and recent media. Well, what do you know - never in my life have I felt that a movie does a book such a massive disservice.

The first thing that immediately clicked with me was the numerous mentions and huge respect for the classic 80s and 90s videogames. I'm an avid gamer myself, and although I wasn't alive back when Atari, Turbografx, Amiga, Spectrum and the arcades were in their prime, I still took time to familiarise myself with their catalogues, because there's nothing quite like retrogames out there on the market, be it PC or console, and while those older games might not be as pretty or intuitive as the modern ones, they are perfectly capable of supplying you with tons of visceral fun, and a lot of features and gameplay ideas presented in the oldies have not seen an equivalent or continuation ever since. Hell, the entire genres died out by now, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a recently made text adventure of Zork's scale with a flexible parser that wasn't made by an enthusiast for strictly non-commerical purposes.

Discovering a couple of new cool rock&amp;roll bands was a huge and welcome surprise, too - as a massive *AC/DC* fan, I couldn't have fallen in love with *Rush* any quicker, and chances are, I would've never learnt about the band on my own without RPO.

Referenced movies deserve another special mention - while the book certainly couldnt've encompassed the entirety of film classics and there were some unfortunate omissions, the inclusion of *Hard Boiled*, Kevin Smith's works, and the *Matrix* trilogy in its entirety (considered to be one of the ""big"" trilogies by the character of Halliday's caliber, which has got to be worth something!) genuinely warmed my heart. In my experience, discussions around the Matrix usually boil down to ""the good original vs the shitty sequels"", so RPO gave me, a massive fan of Matrix: Reloaded, a bit of validation in that regard.

But the meat of the book is, of course, not the incessant movie- or videogame references, but the virtual reality itself, the OASIS. The idea of advanced civilizations facing a crisis and isolating themselves in perfectly modelled virtual worlds has been something on the mind of both the classic sci-fi authors and scientists for a long time now - just thnk back to *Summa Technologiae* by Stanisław Lem or *The Lion of Comarre* by Arthur C. Clarke. But while the books that I read before mostly explored this possibility as an apocalyptic scenario, RPO took a shot at depicting it from the point of view of a regular player. And the reason I fell in love with RPO almost immediately was because it does such a great job at picturing this player.

Back in the day, I used to spend a lot of time in MMOs and competitive multiplayer games. It is through them that I met most of my closest, life-long friends. I'm generally familiar with the type of crowd that plays MMOs, and it takes all kinds - there are people who want to escape reality for an evening, people who find solace in social interaction while doing something fun together, people who just want to turn their minds off and grind monsters for an hour or two... And then there's a special category - complete social outcasts obsessed with a singular idea. More often than not, their social disengagement is caused by external factors - at least among those whom I met myself. The reason behind their social circumstances can be anything: for instance, fucked up, disfunctional families (criminal records among parents, divorces, scandals and arguments, drug abuse, death of beloved relatives, etc.). Or deeply-rooted physical and psychological issues that are hard/impossible to correct even with the help of medical professionals. Ultimately, though, what matters is that this particular group of people takes videogame immersion to a new level. Their sheer dedication to a cause, relentless ability to grind, level up, improve, learn mechanics and stand out among their peers is nothing short of a miracle. Now, I don't know about you, but if I play the same game for 8 hours straight, every day for 5 years, I tend to get tired and bored of it. These people? Not so much! They might not have many other prospects in life aside from their chosen MMO, but when they get into gear, they do it better than anyone else. And it's this particular form of implacable zeal that I see personified in Wade, RPO's protagonist.

He's willing to give up everything, including his own life, to achieve a dream that, at first glance, seems unattainable. What are the chances that a school kid with no money, reputation, or connections could win a single multi-billion dollar prize in the most popular contest in the world? This kind of success story is akin to the experience of competitive e-sports players who, despite the entire world's expectations, tradition, and common sense suggesting to do otherwise, take the plunge, drop out of school, leave their part-time job, break off friendships, forget about everything else, and focus on a singular most important thing in the world - becoming the best there ever was. They know their chance of success is minimal, they know that kids all over the world try to do exactly the same, and yet it's never a reason to stop. If this isn't the most inspirational example to follow your dreams, and circumstances be damned, then I don't know what is. This is the kind of image that I keep in my mind when I want to become better at my own job or acquire a new skill. Except that I have it much easier - I have a safety net to fall back to, a supportive family, a savings account - while people like Wade and his real-life counterparts have nothing except a bunch of griefs and an idea of a better life. And just thinking about that makes me shiver in awe.

The tone of the book and its dystopian world fit the narrative perfectly - the movie's pale attempt at depicting the catastrophic state that the world found itself in is a far cry from the book's atmosphere of absolute depravity. You know things are bad when you have to take an armoured bus complete with a set of armed security guards to make it to another city alive. When reading these short ""real-world"" snippets in-between the virtual action, the choice to spend life in OASIS loses its ambiguity and becomes a sensible thing to do. Considering the advancements of VR technology, the constant fighting for material resources, the heated political atmosphere between nations, today it's easier than ever to put yourself in Wade's shoes and imagine his reality as your own.

In the end, the only thing that left me disappointed was the fact that in finale both Wade and Halliday admitted defeat in the ""digital vs real world"" dilemma and voiced preference for real life. For both, the cause was love, and both were eventually disillusioned in their choice of virtual reality vs the tangible one. I think the book would've sent a more powerful message without that moral lesson, although I do appreciate its inclusion to end the story on a positive note. But a lot of people whom I personally met - the virtual-bound geeks and nerds who spend their lives gaming - simply don't have a choice like that, for one reason or another, and it would've been interesting to see Wade give up his real-life identity for good after winning the contest.

And that pretty much wraps it up. If you made it all the way to the end, thank you for reading my ramblings. I can't believe that I've been sleeping on this book for so long, and I wish I read it much sooner. This experience is not something I'm going to forget any time soon, and rarely have I felt such a profound connection with a book and the characters depicted within.","I just finished Ready Player One, and it was fantastic",1592166909
books,"So today I finished this book by Haruki murakami after reading it past 3 days and I have mixed feelings about this one. 

So I am not a very big reader but I do enjoy reading books which give some kind of depth to the story or the characters. I started reading this book after a friend suggested me and found it to be quite interesting. This was one of the easiest books I have read ( last book being Thinking fast and slow) 
Being a psychologist, I felt the way they portrayed depression was pretty interesting and realistic. I loved the atypical melancholy that follows throughout the book however there were some parts which I couldn't really get my self to love. 
Firstly, I felt it was really difficult to fall in love with anyone of the characters in this book. I don't believe it's important as I hated everyone when I read the Great Gatsby but felt the book was spectacular. However I failed to connect with most of the characters in this book. Now I don't know if it's because of the culture difference but I felt the book was over sexualized in many aspects. The scene where Midori talks about getting naked infront of her dead father's picture, I felt it was something unusual. Infact I felt lot of things that Midori said we're really unrelatable. Maybe that was the point, however I really felt that the female characters were very submissive in this book. For example, hatsumi, I would have loved to learn more about her but it got overshadowed with a character being someone who is completely submissive and is hoping that her cheating boyfriend one day will stop cheating and change. 
I was not a big fan of Reiko and the ending with her and Watanabe just felt so unnatural to me. 
The only character I actually liked was stormtrooper. Lol and to a very extent Nagasawa. Yes he was an ass but he was pretty clear about what he wanted and what he didn't. 

I don't know, I think the book had some really good parts too, I did enjoy Watanabes character as someone who was fighting his own demons and had no control over what was really happening in his life but overall I wasn't quite impressed or maybe I failed to get the point on why so many people absolutely loved this book.",Norwegian wood... masterpiece or disappointing?,1592166833

books,"I just finished reading this book for the first time and was disheartened by example after example of our nation going back on its word for the sake of plunder.

It was particularly sad to see the often elegant and humble pleas of the tribal leaders who simply desired to live at peace in the land ceded to them in past treaties.

As a Christian, I was further saddened by the ways many who proclaimed to be followers of Christ dismissed any semblance of grace and justice toward the natives.  There was one ray of hope when it showed churches speaking out against a particular case upon learning of the situation in a newspaper editorial.  In that case the voices of the people influenced the policy toward that tribe, but certainly could have gone further.

The book is a somber warning to guard against having a certain viewpoint of another group (e.g.) labeling them as ""savages"" and turning a blind eye to atrocities committed against them.

The book ends in a grave and cutting challenge to those among us who proclaim Christ as Lord.  May we seek justice in all areas as history continues to be written so that we may have ""Peace on Earth and  Goodwill to all Mankind.""",Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee is a heart wrenching account of the decades of atrocities perpetuated against an entire people group.

books,"Was just wondering if an ending to a novel, that up to that point was great if not damn near perfect, was that bad that it completely ruined ever re-reading it for anyone else? 

(Spoilers for Stephen King's The Stand)

I'm a huge Stephen King fan, and I find the old adage that King fluffs his endings to be for the most part untrue... Except in the case of The Stand. What brings me to highlight that particular novel is not only the grandiose nature of it, but how extreme both sides of the coin are.

The Stand is this huge, epic post-apocalyptic novel, and for the first 90% of it I was in love. I loved the characters, the world, the stakes... Everything was perfect, and I sped through the book. I couldn't wait for this epic showdown with the seemingly undefeatable Randall Flagg, and as the novel drew to it's climax, I was so excited to see how it was going to get wrapped up...

Just for (again, SPOILERS) a villainous side character to appear with a nuclear bomb and take out the main antagonist, his army, and a few main characters. That's it. 

I have never been so let down by an ending before in my life. The ending completely soured my experience of a novel that, up to that point, was becoming my favourite King novel. This was a fair few years ago, but I can't bring myself to re-read it because of the ending... This ending that was unearned, unsatisfying and a huge slap in the face.

I (30F) really love to read a relationship self-help books, especially which are based on studies with hundreds of couples participated such as; 'The 7 principles for making Marriage Work'. 

The last book I read (3 months ago) was a life-changing ('The 4 Foundations of Love')!  

Before I read it my bf broke up with me 4 times claiming he didn't see me as the mother of his future children  (we have been together for 2 years) , anyway during our last breakup I came across  the book, which is written by someone who is very popular in my country with getting ex back, re-connect and rectify relationships And of course  based on extensive research, as I like . 

I read it (twice) and implemented the Amsterdam method, which is actually to build a shared imaginary future. And since then, everything is changed. 

He has become 'obsessed' with me, he calls me 20 times a day, every minute he wants to be with me. I truly understand why; it’s because he now believes that with me, in our relationship, he will become the best version of himself, he will be promoted at work, he will receive more pay, and most importantly he says that I am the only one he wants to be with for the rest of his life, which is great , sometimes and sometimes not. 

Therefore, I need your help to find a new self-help book that might help me to understand what to do and how. I think, in our relationship, I was used to be the pursuer and I don’t know how to get rid of it....",Books for relationship- changing,1592148399

I hate depressing endings. I goddamn hate them. My first thought after completing this book was ""No wonder Hemingway killed himself.""

And yet this book just made my heart go 'HNNGGHH' constantly. The romanticism here is among Hemingway's best. His thematic material is often poignant, but this ending was on another level...for better or worse.

Before this, I had not read a title from Hemingway in several years. Because I did not like the last book of his I read (For Whom the Bell Tolls). Despite that, Hemingway is overall my favorite writer. He has a poignancy like no other writer I've seen. 

I've read four of his books now. Would rank them as such, from best to worst:

1) The Sun Also Rises

2) A Farewell to Arms

3) The Old Man and the Sea

4) For Whom the Bell Tolls (the only one I didn't care for)

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's because I just finished *A Farewell to Arms*, but I'm tempted to put it at first. I think the ending holds it back, because it doesn't exactly evoke positive feelings from me...goddamn it.

I don't think I understand much of what happened except that as it did happen, as the story unraveled, it all made sense but I could never summarize this story and make it sound even a fraction of how good it is. I know the pretentious literarians don't like Murakami but even if you are one, you should give this book a shot. It's an absolute masterpiece in every sense, even the prose that's usually the weakest part of any Murakami novel (since it's a translation) is haunting in this one. I think all the novels translated by Jay Rubin are pretty well done whereas Kafka on the shore suffers from extremely basic writing, this book does not. It's not highbrow writing but it satisfactory and Murakami at least this time has metaphors that make sense that you dont have to twist your brain to imagine. I like everything about this book except for the overly detailed sex (?), like why did May Kasahara felt the need to write about being naked? And why did we need to know about the protagonist's masturbation habits? Well, at least the sex here makes more sense and has to do with the story more than in Norwegian wood. 


I have some questions though, was lieutenant Mamiya freed from the curse after he wrote it all to Toru Okada? Where did May Kasahara's letters even go? Is the wind up bird chronicle made up by Cinnamon or is it actually true? If it is, how does Cinnamon know all this? Was Cinnamon the boy in the night and is that how he lost his voice? I'd be very glad if someone could answer these.",The wind up bird chronicle has to be the strangest book I've ever read,1592145307

books,"i stopped reading for a good 5-6 years, from the age 13-18 i stopped reading, because everything that i read, and everything that readers in my circle talks about is romantic YA. while i’m a fan of romance book, i could never relate to it. i don’t like what i was reading, white boy liked a white girl, girl rejects him, boy tries harder, girl fall for him. that sort of things. 

and i never really liked it, because i couldn’t relate to it. so i just stopped reading, because i couldn’t relate to it. i couldn’t enjoy it. 

in 2018, one of my queer friends introduced me to the price of salt, a 1950s lesbian romance. and it was then that i realized, i love reading. i still do. but i was just ‘reading the wrong books’.

The price of salt sparked my love for reading again, and i started looking for books that feature the lgbt community, i started looking for books that feature POC, i started looking for books that talks about mental health.

and my love for reading was reignite, and i never stop reading since then.

There were a lot of confusing info dumps throughout the book but some other parts were like movie scenes really cool character back stories and development. I recommend it especially if you like physics and other sciences. Also video game enthusiast will probably enjoy it. 

Since high school I hadn’t really read much for pleasure. Reading became a chore and honestly I never really read the books that had been assigned I just looked up summaries. I would read self help books every now and then, but only half way through.

books,"Denis Johnson, probably one of the most underrated writers that most people have not heard about yet he is loved by writers themselves. I urge all of you to read Jesus' son (its like 120 pages so not long). When reading it don't try to analyse it too deeply and just enjoy the way he writes. He talks about drug abuse (heroin,pills etc), abortions,death but he does it in such a way that is honest, not morbid and with a subtle poetry that even for someone like me who cant relate to any of those things it makes you pity the characters and empathise with them deeply.

The book is short stories following an unnamed narrator looking back on events or periods of his life. Don't want to give much away but read it and just focus on the mood and tone he sets. If fellow writers praise you then you must be good.

If you want to check out other works then try Largesse of the Sea Maiden which is another short story collection but its funny, sad and with characters down on their luck. He finished the book just before he passed away and the book deals with death as a main theme.

I started reading a lot recently (about a book per week).  Obviously that can get quite expensive as I am still a college student, so I am on a budget. My solution to that is to buy mainly used books as I don´t really mind if they are new or used. The problem about that is if you buy used books the authors don´t get their fair share for their great work. When you think about it, buying a used book is about the same as pirating an e-book. I came to the compromise to only buy used books from authors already being dead and try to save money for new books.

My confusion with this short story (by Ted Chiang, who I've just been informed about and now plan on ingesting his works thoroughly) is that Louise doesn't just change the way she views reality but more so, the way she views it seems to have real changes on her intellect to a drastic degree.  What is the origin of her newfound capabilities in foresight?
