books,"My mom passed away about three years ago, and I have finally been going through all of her things. She was pretty strict when it came to violent movies/media in our house growing up. I was really suprised to find many original Stephen King books in her book collection. Titles include:

*Needful Things, The Stand, Gerald's Game, IT, The Dark Half, The Tommyknockers, Christine*

And the one I was most interested in was *The Bachman Books*

From what I see there's a short story in the collection called 'Rage'. I'm sure a few google searches can answer this question but was that book banned after the Sandy Hook tragedy? 

Stephen King has always been one of my favorite authors, and I wish my mom would've told me she secretly read his books as well. Like mother, like son I guess.

She also had a bookmark left in The Tommyknockers, and it left me with a desire to read and share the experience with her. RIP momma, thank you for the books.",My mom left behind an impressive collection of Stephen King hardback books. I think one is banned in the U.S.?,1578181018

books,"I've been trying to understand what goes on in people's minds when they are looking through reviews, say on Goodreads or Amazon.

My hypothesis is that people try to form a mental picture of the book by taking bits and pieces off different reviews--- with a grain of salt for the subjectivity.

I, for example, have a taste for non-fiction, and I am usually looking for books that give me answers. So I try to understand if the book has those answers. As a plus, I try to see if people are generally happy, and if there are any big issues they are very unhappy about.

What do you look for in Goodreads/Amazon reviews for books? What do you try to fill your mental picture with? (Or maybe you disagree with the mental-picture hypothesis?)

My first thought was that I should re-read the first 2 books to refresh my memory. Or at least skip through them.

But then I thought ""I don't have time for that, there are so many other books that I want to read!""

And I freaked out for a bit about not having enough time to read all the stories I want to read. And a general sense of being overwhelmed by the amount of information I want to take in set in. Then of course the physical, human limitations I have hit me in the balls.

I spend hours, reading instead of the work that must be done. And a lot of times it's pretty poorly written books, but my brain just craves one my dose of text I can read. 

The problem is, when I try to restraint myself from reading, I start to read anything, just to keep my brain reading: old texts in the phone, ads in the bus, random writing on a walls. Text is all around us and reading it makes me want to come back to novels I could be reading, because they are so much more interesting then this advertising of the theater on a wall. 

When I'm at home I read, when I'm in university I read, even during the walking I read.

books,"Considered a completely impenetrable work of Joyce’s, Finnegans Wake is often said to be the hardest piece of literature in the English language. With nonsense English, endless allusions and a manual to it that spans 31,000 pages, it truly is a beast.

I was curious if I would love them again and if I would find some more than just fun in them now.
In short yes and yes, and below is a more detailed account of my thoughts. 
I would love to get others' perspective, especially since this is currently the most popular reading material on Amazon (wow). So please share!

- As before, the short stories (first two books) really seem much better than the novels (the following 5 books) with the exception of the one with Regis and Milva
- This is the kind of wry, vulgar humor that I adore. I love the exorcism joke in The Last Wish.
- I'm reading in English this time, translated by Danusia Stok, and it does lose a lot of language humor and depth. Who translated your versions? How do you like it?
- there is definitely a domme vibe to Yennefer that went absolutely above my head the last time. I like her even more now:)
- I never noticed before but this IS definitely a dying world there and the parallels to our times are astounding, environmental context, war, discrimination, it's all there and not superficially either. All this bears a lot of meaning for both the heroes and the plot. At the same time it's all shown through dialogue and plot, not described in a straightforward way. A lot of things you have to guess and imagine and I think this is awesome
- while I used to identify with Ciri, I'm now more focused on Geralt and Yennefer and their quarrels and discussions struck a true chord, this is well done
- I like the raw masculinity of Geralt and how he tries to surpress it with literature and philosophy but it mostly doesn't work; what does though is fatherhood. This is super interesting to me
- likewise, parenthood is a major theme throughout the series. Starting with the striga, who was the king's daughter, with Nenneke, who is a mother figure, Calanthe, there are a lot of parents there and Yennefers dream of being a mother fits this theme

I could go on and on about impossible choices, choosing sides, realism, companionship etc but I'd rather read what other people have to say:)",Rereading the Witcher books - impressions,1578148523

books,"The book “1984” by George Orwell is a literary masterpiece. The reality portrayed in “1984” is really enlightening. And surprisingly enough, it resonates with the ideology of another piece of art, Todd Phillips’ “Joker”, especially, the character arcs. And that left me thinking – are there any shades of Winston Smith in Arthur Fleck or vice-versa? Do their psychologies click to a certain extent? So here I am drawing a comparison between them.

Winston Smith and Arthur Fleck sprout from the same roots – their mentalities, their beliefs systems and moralities – even the fact that they both harbour a suppressed grudge for the society and the system in control. It feels Winston is the “Joker” but more subtle. Compared to Arthur, Winston is passive, hesitant, less expressive. The reason is obvious of course – the Party’s shrewd prying eyes and the thought-police, not taking into consideration his own fears and insecurities.

Until the later parts when Winston vows to work for the supposed Brotherhood under O’Brien, he never really leaves the mainstream of his life to protest against the Party. Winston, in this respect, contradicts Arthur. Winston is clever, more rational. He knows that his overt actions will have severe consequences. He has accepted his inability and lack of power. He knows he is nothing alone when trying to stand against a collective group of cynical masterminds. Thus, he continues playing a part in the play, except the fact that he’s self-aware about it.

It’s almost ironic how the most unique aspect of Winston’s character is the fact that he isn’t *that* unique if we don't take his psyche into account. He can’t be singled out from a population and *that* is his real power. But, on the other hand, Arthur is, in fact, unique. He is like a black sheep in the contemporary Gotham society. His condition that leads to his sudden fits of laughter, his appearance, his mental state, his messed up back-story, his daily clashes with reality was already enough evidence to put him into a unique position in the society.

Both Winston and Arthur descended into eccentricity in their own ways. Like Arthur, Winston too undergoes a drastic change of personality, induced by O’Brien’s physical and mental torture. A similarity here is that in both cases, it’s the society that triggers their mental metamorphosis. The difference is, Arthur changes *against* the society, while Winston changes *for* it. And evidently, Joker wins, but Winston’s dystopian fate doesn’t let him to.

Both Winston and Arthur had different ways of protesting against the society. Arthur, throughout his transformation into Joker, rebels against the cruel rigidity of the society by tipping the entire construction of the society into chaos. In the case of Winston, his love and union with Julia were his means to rebel, disrupt the order and orthodoxy of the Party.

Coming to the ending, we see, George Orwell didn’t knit up a happy ending to please the readers. Arthur ultimately won. There were bitter sacrifices of course. But, Joker was successful in his purpose. But Winston wasn’t. That’s why the ending in “1984” hits so close to reality. It instils fear in the minds. The ultimate epiphany pushes the readers into a depressing downward spiral. Finishing “1984” to me was like waking up from a nightmare, only realizing that it was true. The wall between fictional and actual reality becomes blurry. The uncanniness intensifies.

It can be concluded that both Arthur and Winston makes us look at our daily reality with a fresh and changed outlook. Both intend on pulling us up from a slumber of ignorance. And in that, they both were equally successful.

“Get the greatest men from the greatest nations to put their heads together and talk. But there’ll always be evil lurking around the corner for us. Oh yes! They’re busy, even now, even as we speak, busy conspiring to put civilization to the torch. And they’re clever, oh, devilishly clever.
