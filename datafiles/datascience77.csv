datascience,"I've been mulling this over in my head for a while but have never worked with this kind of prediction approach so I figured I'd ask here.

In this situation, I want to predict the winner of an NBA game. I have data on all the NBA games prior to that point, where each row is a team, and their statistics for that game (points scored, rebounds, etc). You can join the opposing team's data based on the game ID so it then becomes a row per game with TEAM\_A and TEAM\_B, and variables of POINTS\_A, POINTS\_B, etc. 

My current approach was to get a team's averages across those categories leading into a game and then make a model but it has a ""fatal"" flaw. In this case, predicting using those variables will create some innate bias where the variable POINTS\_A might be more important than POINTS\_B and so then it might favor a particular team depending on who is assigned as A versus B.

I see a lot of sports sites doing Monte Carlo type simulations for sports and am wondering if someone could point me in the right direction on doing that here, as that seems like a better approach than what I am currently trying. Thanks in advance!

datascience,"Hi,

Any career advice for an undergraduate? :) Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I really need it.. I have to understand what I else I need to learn while I have a chance and etc :\]

*Background:* I have completed BA in Sociology last year. My main focus was on the research side of Sociology (collecting data + data analysis). I studied R, Python in the uni and have studied SQL, lil bit of Java on my own. I prefer to work in team.

At the moment I work in the field of marketing (B2B), my job is mainly about client service. I work with quantitative research, I analyze the data (in Excel :( ) and prepare powerpoint presentations with the findings for the clients :) I find the latter part kind of boring, whilst the data itself always interested me.

This is why I am looking for ways to change my career path to something more related to data/IT. However, I cannot understand which career might suit me better since I have no experience with working in this field. **I would love to hear different opinions and advice from the skilled data specialists!** 

At the moment I am torn between two paths. I *think* I want to go into Data Engineering or into Data Science.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Why Data Engineering?

I have knowledge of the marketing field; thus, I feel like I may use it for BI. Currently I am enrolled in a free introduction course to Data Engineering and have introduced myself to the basics of handling databases servers on my side and in the cloud, database modeling, working with data in TableaU. I also know SQL (not at the advanced level, but I am slowly progressing), and a bit of Python and Java on top of it.

I view DE as a path where I might apply my experience from my current job + other technical skills which I have learned on my own/ in the uni. Yet I think I am seriously underqualified at the moment, and I am scared that the absence of technical background will affect this career path a lot., especially getting into it.

2. Why Data Science?

I have kind of worked in the DS field during my university years. I am familiar with the main methods of regression, classification, predictions etc... I have experience in data modeling and analyzing the results. I have used SPSS, Stata, R and Python for this.

I view DS as a path where I might apply my skills from the university + it seems more interesting since I always liked trying different models and seeing the results. Yet, a crucial part of DS is understanding statistics, and I always struggled with it A LOT. I am not sure if I will be able to better myself in this area.

I AM sure there are more career paths for me with my experience and knowledge, but I kind of lost in the many types of data specialization.

datascience,"In your typical prediction models you have accuracy metrics like MSE for linear regression or MAPE for time-series forecasting. For pricing models you're trying to output a continuous variable - the price for a product/service. If you're using supervised learning-based algorithms, it would seem like you would fit models and optimize them on historical data (previous transactions &amp; pricing).

But from what I can tell, the accuracy metric (e.g., MSE) in this case doesn't actually tell you the true accuracy/performance of the pricing model. It only reveals how well the model mimics the past pricing pattern from the data it was trained on.

With the output price from a pricing model and the COGS you can predict how much margin you'll be making, but the other crucial piece of the puzzle is whether buyers are willing to stomach the price. In bid-ask marketplaces you can directly see an indicator of demand elasticity and use the difference to further fine-tune a pricing model. But in other non-negotiation marketplaces, you at'd best know only whether a potential buyer accepted/rejected a quote. (In some dynamic pricing marketplaces like airline tickets you could see whether one price was accepted over another price for the same customer, but it seems like a brute-force method with potential UX friction for other marketplaces). 

What I'm curious about is two things:

1. In the first case where you have data on the difference between a model-output price and the max price buyers were willing to pay, how do you further fine-tune a model with that data?
2. In the second case where you don't have that data, how do you improve your pricing models then? Besides automatically decrementing/incrementing the pricing model predictions?",Pricing model metrics for optimization,1611079213
datascience,"I am transitioning from a data analyst to a data scientist within my company and they have informed me with this transition they want to see more predictive analytics. I work in the financial services industry so they want to see projects like ""where should we open a new branch?"" (Just an example).

Now I understand that I can look at the demographics of our current branches and find sites which look similar but the topic of ""where to open a branch"" is very large using lots of different factors; other nearby FIs, Population, Traffic, etc. I have ran close to 30 different factors through a regression to see which of these matter the most to branch profitability and every branch is different. We have branches in small town USA which are doing fantastic and branches in major cities which are struggling. This project seems way too vast to be handled by plugging demographics into an algorithm and saying ""yes"" or ""no""

This was just one example, but there are lots of other projects we discussed which have similar issues to this.

One other example is next best product, I used the apriori algorithm on our customer data and the only results I got were along the lines of ""If they are a teenager, maybe they want Teen Checking"" or ""If they have a checking account, maybe they want a debit card"".

I've always preferred the theory and algorithmic side of CS, particularly math-based parts, so when I started getting into Machine Learning I got *really* excited because that's exactly what I've always loved about the subject. I've been self-learning for about a year now and while I can say I really love how broad the applications are, it's very dense and I'll need to take a few more semesters of math and statistics to truly go deeper into the theory. I hate, however, actually applying it; whenever I start on a project of mine, I stop because I can't stand just simply importing a library, manipulating the data, setting up a training model, and predicting results without doing any thinking, it just ends up being copying and pasting old code for new purposes.

I really like the idea of doing data-related research within other industries though, stuff such as using ML for genome analysis or drug creation (bioinformatics), quantitative analysis, and audio analysis (I've particularly liked [this recent research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08512)). I also know for sure that I don't want to end up doing big data analysis for some company's sales. So in a nutshell, my ideal job would be doing research and coming up with new data analysis models/techniques that incorporates another field of expertise or specialty (hopefully more collaborative but with people in other positions, like medicinal researchers or economists rather than someone in a similar position as me), something where a great deal of research is required but with a fair amount of application and actually putting that research into code. Something where there's a fairly high amount of interest but still a lot of research yet to be done.

Anyways, the main caveat is that I don't have the money to go for more than 5 years, and my choice on what my masters would be in a 5 year program depends on what field I want to go into, because my school offers a lot of different options.

If you are able to help me figure out more concretely what it is I should be going into is based on what I'm interested in, I would appreciate it *so much*!

I'm a master student in economic history, and as such a bit lacking in stats-knowledge. Although I've taken a few semester of both statistics and econometrics. Sadly my department is a bit weak in quant so I don't have a lot of people to ask in my department.

I'm trying to understand what models to use to model time series. I'm reading up on ARIMA and dynamic regression models in Hyndman's [https://otexts.com/fpp2](https://otexts.com/fpp2). But I fail to understand the use of these models. Yes I can fit a curve to the data very nicely, and both AR and MA-processes make a lot of intuitive sense. But they only seem to allow for 1-step ahead forecasts, considering that they always need to be feeded with fresh data on the previous observation. So what is the practical application in forecasting? It just seems very limited. 

dynamic ARIMA regression models seem to be slightly more useful, since they allow for an external regressor. But still, for forecasting you rely on that t-1 datapoint.

Am I wasting my time here? What I want to do is to basically model a time series of word frequencies produced from tweets during 2 months, to movement data from the Google mobility report.

datascience,"  I’ve had a funky career path to becoming a Data Scientist, so I thought I’d share in case it was helpful to someone else.

My highest (and only) degree is a B.S. in Chemical Engineering. Using this degree, I was able to get a “technician” level job in a chemistry lab doing R&amp;D and Process Engineering for a plastics startup. I worked this job for around 4 years, but the culture of the company was never going to allow me to get a promotion or work on projects I really enjoyed. The culture of the company also heavily emphasized things like Design of Experiments, Statistics, and Statistical Process Control, which I really enjoyed.

In general, I didn’t like working in a chemistry lab, and spent some time researching adjacent fields using the skills that I had. This is where I came across Data Science as an option. After going through dozens of job postings trying to determine the skills that I needed that I didn’t quite have, the only dealbreaker skill I was missing was Python (I had been using JMP for lab R&amp;D stuff, but I’d recommend looking into it for any Data Science project, it’s the first piece of paid software I ask for not called Excel at a new job now). I spent several months on LinkedIn Learning (very affordable) consuming any Python and Data Science course I could.

Great, I have the requisite skills at this point and several years of experience on my resume. After months of searching while still working for the plastics startup, I land a job as a Research Scientist at a lithium-ion battery startup because of my cross-skills handling data and my laboratory experience. Originally, I was going to work 50/50 data/laboratory, but I spoiled my boss with access to insights he was never able to obtain before and it became 90/10 data/laboratory, and a lot of the lab stuff was I know how to operate an FTIR, run a pressurized gas line, or troubleshoot lab equipment that the fresh Master’s Degree employees did not.

Working for the battery startup as the only “data guy,” it was a mixed bag of Data Science, Data Engineering, Analytics, and some days Data Entry. There was no data (or IT) infrastructure, and I built out automated pipelines, generated reports in jupyter notebooks (and powerpoint), and answered some very interesting battery questions. I worked this job for almost 1 ½ years until Covid hit. A startup can’t afford to pay employees who can’t show up to a lab to work, New York State banned all “non-essential” work (a rant for another day) and I got laid off. My job could be done remotely, but the lab scientists’ responsibilities could not, and I supported their work.

So, in the midst of a pandemic and living in upstate NY (not exactly a Data Science boom area) I needed to find my second Data Science job. After 450 job applications in 6 months, targeting only remote jobs, I got around a dozen phone screens, 5 job interviews (including one where the CEO took the zoom session from her couch), and 1 job offer. For the past several months I have been a remote Data Scientist at a retailer on their Business Intelligence team. I don’t make six figures, but I’m doing very well for the cost of living in my city.

While I do have some interest in pursing a Master’s or PhD, I’m not sure the cost-benefit analysis really pans out at this point.

The tl;dr is that I broke into Data Science with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering by first learning statistics through a job, then teaching myself Python and finding the right company that needed my unique set of skills.",My experience transitioning into Data Science,1610990343

Hello everyone!!

I am a 24 year old graduate student at a big 10 university. I am current on my second year of my PhD, 3 more to go! My research is on life sciences, the majority of it has been focused on building a model( monte Carlo simulation) to simulate contamination. I currently use R, I have learned a lot, I would say I am proficient but far from being an expert. My university give PhD student the option to get a Masters in applied statistics, it is 9 clases total. This semester will be my first semester taking those classes! I am doing it because it is a good opportunity and I think I’ll enjoy it.

This made me think that by the end of my PhD I could pursue a career in data science if I really put some extra time on learning more and more skills on top of the statistics learning I’ll do!

* Security is one aspect which both Snowflake and Redshift have been watchful, which results in their top notch security architecture that couldn’t be breached.
* Snowflake has the upper hand when it comes to dealing with JSON storage, not only that, it requires just a minimal amount of maintenance when compared to Redshift.
* Amazon’s Redshift is capable of integration with DynamoDB, Athena, Kinesis Data Firehose, EMR, SageMaker, Glue, Database Migration Service (DMS), CloudWatch Schema Conversion Tools (SCT), etc. This builds an ecosystem of Amazon web services which comes in hand with integrations.
* Snowflake doesn’t work wonders with the above mentioned integration but it is capable of its own seamless integrations with Informatica, IBM Cognos, Qlik, Power BI, Apache Spark, Tableau, etc.
* Snowflake requires less maintenance when compared to Redshift however the performance capabilities are not very different.

I am trying to decide between a masters degree in Data science from (Berkeley MIDS or UIUC MCSDS) both are online Masters in Data science.Also, recently came across the program of Masters of science in business analytics, which will have classes on weekends from UC san Diego. Now i am confused which program will lead to better job opportunities and career growth. How do we weigh a Masters in Data science with a Masters in Business Analytics. Which program would have better career opportunities. As per my background, I am technical lead for Oracle  database management team, trying to get data science or analytics.",Hi,1610935334
datascience,"Some background:
I’m finishing my economics major in a brazilian notsogood uni. But somehow I’ve managed to get a work from home internship into a economics/data science consulting firm in Sao Paulo (not my city) where my peers are all from top 4 brazilin uni. And it pays very well.

My short/medium term goal is to have a full time work there. In the long run, work in another country (our currency is very cheap) which would allow better savings rate.

Ok. About my question. Which is better: do a second major in stats (I could do it along the work), apply for a master either on stats or applied econ (probably I would have to resign my future work) or self study?

Though I can do data analysis, basic stats, regressions etc. Im not very confident nor comfortable about my skills. 

Btw sorry my english.
Thanks in advance.",Second bacharel or master?,1610931906

datascience,"I've been working as a junior data scientist at a large financial services company for two years now. The job itself is alright but the subject matter of the company itself isn't a major turn-on. I've been pretty ambivalent to that fact for ages but all the COVID purgatory contemplation time is making me put that to question: *am I ok not being into it* 

I'm trying to look for roles where the context isn't set in a services-based setting and rather something I contextually enjoy. For example, roles based around energy systems, public infrastructure, climate data and sustainability, national labs and other scientific institutions etc - I suppose any industry or organization outside of the purely customer insights analysis. Just to fill-in a bit more detail: 

* With respect to any fields mentioned, is there usually different eduacation benchmarks (MS,PhD,etc.) -  I've a masters in applied math for reference. Are there limits  of progression based on degree qualifications? 
* Do they require domain knowledges that are particularly niche (e.g. work involving climate data needing a degree based in climate science) 
* Are there any particularly effective methods for searching out roles in these fields?","How would I go about finding data science jobs that don't revolve around the typical services (financial, retail) gig?",1610922301
