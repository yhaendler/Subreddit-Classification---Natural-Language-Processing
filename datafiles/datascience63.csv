datascience,"I just started working as a data scientist. CS dropout due to Rona. I have worked  3 jobs, all having me sign an NDA. Lol who's gonna take a 3-semester CS dropout's word that he actually knows data sci? All they'd let me release was the scraping scripts. And everyone and their aunt knows scraping these days. I got the first two jobs because I had a blog called Sterria Intellisoft where I posted analytics of datasets I found on Kaggle and AWS DE, I did some BERT on Taylor Schwift's lyrics, some soccer stats, some this model vs. that model, posted my ""how ML algorithms work"" post which had 50 comments... But that blog is gone with the wind and I don't have the posts backed up. Last time I use Wordpress.

Now I wanna have another blog that would help people hire me. But I find myself confused with the new data on Kaggle... All election and the Rona. I hate them. Plus I want to scrape my own data. I had this wild idea to scrape /r/learnprogramming but then they banned me because I told them people should start by learning 6502. So I hate them. I'm really out of ideas as of what attracts people these days, besides the election and the pandemic.

Do you have something in your mind that doesn't interest you? A dataset you've seen on Kaggle or AWS DE but aren't interested enough to analyze it? You can give it to me. I just can't find a good dataset or even a subject which I can scrape data for. Sure, I can run some MCS's on the remaining states. However, I feel like data scientists who aren't professionals hired by data firms that are trusted by the news sources are just trolling Trump fans at this point. Remember my thread from last night where I asked if there's something called ""possibility"" in statistics? That's because a Trump fan was BEGGING me to tell him that a Trump win is ""possible"". I hate election data and I hate Corona data. I hate any sort of controversial data. Unless you're being paid, why don't you work on some cool data such as the many species of dandelions?

datascience,"Hi all, I'm looking for a tutorial or advice to help me with the following problem:

I'm attempting to build a model to forecast a quantity across a number of locations. The quantity at a given location is independent, but potentially loosely related to the quantity at a different location. I currently have a multivariate seq2seq model built where I treat each location as a feature in a single time series, say I have `X` locations and `Y` fixed variables (day of week, time of day, etc, stuff we already know is going to happen). Concretely, I feed an input of shape `[batches, n_timesteps, X+Y]` into the encoder, then I feed an input of shape `[batches, n_forecast_timesteps, Y]` into the decoder, and my model produces predictions in the shape of `[batches, n_forecast_timesteps, X]`. This works okay, some locations are easier to forecast than others, but it's better than what we have.

What I want to do is convert my location into a feature, via one-hot-encoding or embedding. I believe this may allow the network to better learn interactions between different locations, as well as allowing us to more easily scale up if we want to add more locations. I can easily convert my location into a one hot encoded representation in pandas, but then I get stuck. If I want to feed my data into tensorflow, obviously I need to maintain the temporal structure of my data. This is where I think I'm having a conceptual issue with what needs to happen, code wise, in order to move forward. I've started going through the code in this winning kaggle forecasting submission (https://github.com/Arturus/kaggle-web-traffic) as it is similar to what I'm trying to accomplish, but it's written for an older version of tensorflow and much of the code is going over my head.

My question is this: How do I turn my single, multivariate time series into numerous univariate time series and batch them appropriately to feed into a model without losing the temporal structure of each time series?

What I *think* I have to do is as follows:  
1) Separate my multivariate time series into 1 timeseries for each location.   
2) One hot encode each location (I only have 17, but I'm all ears on one-hot-encoding vs. an embedding layer).  
3) Add the ""known"" features to *each* timeseries.  
4) Create a windowed `tf.data.Dataset` instance for *each* timeseries, much like I do now for the entire multivariate series. This preserves the temporal structure of each series.   
5) Break out train/val/test splits from *each* `Dataset` instance.  
6) Flatten the location-specific `Datasets` into big training/val/test `Datasets`, as doing it this way ensures that all of my training data comes before my validation data that comes before my test data.  
7) Batch and train/validate/test my model as normal.

My initial thought is that word frequency relating to one of the aforementioned categories is simply what the company uses a lot - they might try to brand themselves in public as a company with ""Learning"". An example used, was that Tesla is a company based on learning. But there's a huge difference between how a company brands its culture, vs the actual culture (which can only be derived from interviewing internal employees at all levels of the organization).

We are a small team at a large company, all remote and I am in a senior position here. My boss is not technical and I am new to this industry. 

Our data taxonomy is incredibly confusing and is widely understood to be one of the main challenges for anyone joining the team.  I have only had access to our database for about 3 weeks at this point, but my boss expects me to write working code with no supervision or review.

I try to setup calls to walk through things and get another set of eyes on my work so I know I'm on the right path, but that doesn't always happen due to tight deadlines and reduced headcount.

It seems that cold applying is pointless. You have to basically have someone recommend an interview for you at the company. I don’t know a single soul in the industry. LinkedIn networking is...not working for me to keep it short haha.

None of these jobs were fulfilling for me and after contemplating for many years/months, I decided to return to school to complete a Ms in Data Science. 

I have completed one semester in a top 100 school (world) which has no prerequisites and anyone with a bit of cash can pay to get in. I did extremely well and have transferred to a top 30 school which has a seemingly strict selection process with a renowned  stats school. I have just completed my first semester at the top 30 school. 

Long story short - I feel like I’m not ready for this course. Specifically, the one at the top 30 school. I don’t have a statistics or mathematics background nor a strong programming/computer science background. And the courses I’ve taken this semester have relied HEAVILY on prerequisite undergrad units like linear algebra, calculus, probability, algorithms, data structures in which I’ve only had an introduction to from starting my Ms at the top 100 school.

I wanted to learn EVERYTHING i require over the Christmas break which is around 3 months. 

Any advice DATA scientists?! Is it possible to learn all undergrad math/cs prereqs to a point of comprehension within 3 months so that I can comfortably learn Data Science and compete with my peers?! I just want a good wam with solid fundamentals so I can cop an internship and excel.

The initial idea is to find a load of datasets that have clearly added a channel at a certain point in time, with a KPI value throughout the timeline. use some to test, some to train, then deploy the model is a live experiment for a digital marketing agency. 

**Training** 

3 months worth of touch point data (search, ads pixel and cookie data, email campaign, retargeting), with clear KPI e.g. daily sales, then 2 months in the company introduces a new channel e.g. display ads. the model then looks at the volume of sales before and after adding that channel, and comes out with a figure for how much that channel has contributed.

repeat the process for a bunch of data sets, until the model gets a 'feel' for how much a KPI increases when a certain channel is added based on the existing marketing mix, that would be training. 

**Testing** 

Do the same with test data, and make it predict how much of an impact on KPI adding a channel would have, then compare the prediction to the ground data (average lift in KPI after adding channel) 

**Validation**

Once the model is trained it would be able to analyse a dataset that (which could be visualised as a Markov chain), then based on what it knows from training and testing, it can make a suggestion on what channel to introduce or spend more money on. 

if the company took action on the prediction, it would be able to validate/invalidate that prediction.

Question 1) Is the above any good? 

Question 2) where can I find large multi touch datasets like this to use?

I joined as a data analyst almost three weeks ago (B.Tech in CS) and this is my first 'Real dataset' I'm working on. For this project I have to look for some segment of customers to sell a plan to or change the plan to sell it better to the target audience. 

So I was plotting some graphs and everything was fine until I saw the groups of people according to their class of life, whether they have a loan and if they are interested in taking a loan. The graph broke my heart because a lot of people who earn less and have loans ARE interested in taking another one. And there are some who earn so less that they aren't eligible to take loans but are interested. 

I felt like each of those points were real people, they are. I couldn't stop thinking about those people, how difficult their lives must be, how taking another loan will make it worse for them in the long run. I kept on thinking about what I can do about those people. There's nothing I can do... And it makes me so sad. 

Do any of you feel like this when you end up with data like this? I've never really felt like this and I'm really confused. I don't know what to do or how to help them. Or if I can come up with a new scheme that targets these groups of people which will help them. Is there something I can do? My job is simple, find people to sell something to.

Some insight that is stressed again and again in this sub is the importance of domain knowledge for a data scientist, as it has a crucial impact on the usefulness of ones analytic results. As an aspiring data scientist with a psychological academic background, a natural fit would be an area that works with people related data, but I've struggled to find the best place for me so far. Some possibly fitting areas that I identified would be:

- Marketing/Advertising/Sales/Customer Analytics. For me this is kind of the 'standard domain' of a data scientist in industry. Companies strive for revenue, and directly leveraging the sales of the company is the most direct way for a data scientist to generate value for the company. Personally, I find less purpose than others in this field and would therefore love to hear more about other possibilities for data scientists in the industry to gain insights from people related data. 
- People/HR analytics (including learning analytics). Kind of my best bet right now, but I'm afraid there is a big gap between the US and Europe in terms of how advanced the field is. From what I've seen so far in the most advanced people analytics teams of the biggest company's around me, it looks way more like a new fancy term for reporting/descriptive statistics than data science/predictive model building (what I've only heard from the US in this context so far) . 
- Public Health / Healthcare. Sounds very interesting, but I did not see too many places yet where this is the case. I guess it's also because Europe is way stricter with health data than the US so it's hard to get valuable data. Interested to hear more about concrete career possibilities though. 
- Psychometrics. I read mentions of this quite often together with psychology in this subreddit. But I have the feeling, that at least in Europe even though the tests themselves are often highly statistically evaluated, their application is not too much about data science. Please correct me if there is a market for ""typical"" data science work (modeling, machine learning, etc) outside of the US.
