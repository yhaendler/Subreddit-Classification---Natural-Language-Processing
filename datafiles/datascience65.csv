datascience,"I've always been interested in civic tech and I'm actually about to start a new job in federal government as a Data Scientist. I definitely want to make as much impact as I can, but I was wondering if anyone had experience in it and if so, what were some of the challenges you faced?

For example, they want to start moving from legacy tools to newer ones (SAS/Excel to Python) and they want me to automate some of the work while also teaching analysts how to use Python. I know there are challenges in the sense that people are unwilling to budge from their comfort zone, but how did you navigate those situations? 

Also, I do come from a non traditional background. Currently, less than 7% of government employees are younger than 30. I recently graduated from Berkeley with a BA in Data Science and I'm pretty young to start at a mid level role. I worry that I'll experience ageism and I'm not sure how to interact with other analysts without giving the wrong impression. I get the feeling other analyst/scientists won't take me seriously because I don't have a graduate degree, but I passed all the same interviews as they did and I'd say I have a decent amount industry experience. Obviously I'm very lucky to have landed this role and I'm excited to start, but I worry that 1) data science being relatively new in government will make it hard to create change and 2) my age / background will be a disadvantage when it comes to pitching new ideas.",Anyone here do data science for the government (United States)?,1605828810

datascience,"Hi!

I'm still a n00b in this field, but I'm trying to push a paper out fairly quickly.  The thing is, getting experimental labels is very challenging and may take several months.  However, I have the ability to simulate the system fairly accurately.  

**Project:**  To compute the surface of an imaged object using CNN

**Input:**  x,y,z intensity.  There is a strong response from the surface of the object, turning this project into a ""noisey"" peak finding algorithm.  The surface should be continuous and change slowly in x and y, but only yield a single value for every x,y location.

**Output:** x,y  image yielding the height of the object.  A single image is the output showing a map of the surface. 

**Idea:** I can simulate a range of x,y,z inputs with perfect response and with an added amount of expected variance we see experimentally. This would serve as a ground truth.  I could test it on a subset of the simulated data, to establish the model.  Then maybe the ""hail mary"" is that I observe its performance on experimental data. 

I've already built a model using a UNet CNN with experimental data and hand created labels - although without ground truth it is not exactly clear how accurate it is, but the results are reasonable.  The model performs very well with hand labelled data.  The output value is a classification of 1 from 20 options (each a different binned location in z).  

Thoughts on this? Things I am not considering?

[My Original Post with Benchmarks and struggles to get things working is at: https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jw5go3/hour_one_arm_mac_thoughts/]

## ARM Miniconda is now a thing... with a gotcha.
Since Tuesday, there is now a Miniconda build for ARM. https://conda-forge.org/blog/posts/2020-10-29-macos-arm64/. Miniconda, if you're new to it, is a 'lightweight' version of Anaconda that doesn't come with anything -- just python3.9 and conda. This is ideal if you'd rather `conda install` your packages one by one, knowing each one will definitely be ARM ready as opposed to an emulated Intel package. Of course the downside is, very few packages will be ready for you.

These packages work when you install via `conda install -c conda-forge PACKAGE`:

- Pandas: Works via conda install
- Matplotlib: Works via conda install
- Numpy: Works via conda install
- Scipy: Works via conda install

These do NOT work on ARM Anaconda. If you need these, you must use Intel Anaconda (and even then, some of these packages may get hairy):

- JupyterLab or JupyterNotebooks: Kinda works via Conda Install (it installs, but it does not run Python. I have one more thought on this -- perhaps using a Rosetta JupyterLab that calls an ARM Python Kernel. If this works, I'll update this post. If it doesn't, you see sadness.)- Sklearn: Does not work via conda install (though I know for sure this works on Intel Anaconda)
- Bokeh: Does not work via conda install
- Tensorflow: Does not work via conda install... but does via a new Apple build
- Keras: Does not work via conda install
- Pytorch: Does not work via conda install

There appears to be a way to help your favorite open source libraries build though so if you can help, do so!

## (Rosetta Translated Intel) Anaconda
Anaconda is still an option for installation. If you do that, I strongly recommend using the command line installer because that'll compile everything under Rosetta. The downside with this route is that your Python installation will be an Intel emulated version. The upside is you'll get access to almost every package except those that really hinged on the hooks that x86 processors had.

## TensorFlow for ARM
So I'm sure we all heard about https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos.

...Look I'm super happy for all of you who managed to install it by following the instructions without blinking twice, it did not work for me.

BUT I was able to finally figure it out using this new ARM Miniconda, which upside, means all of my packages (that are available for ARM natively) are incredibly fast. If you want to learn how to install TensorFlow using Miniconda in your own Conda Environment, check out my solution at: https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/issues/3#issuecomment-730107954

## TensorFlow Benchmarks
For those who remembered my previous post, there were a few Macs I benchmarked. Out of the ones I currently can use, I ran a 2 Epoch CNN MNIST Model (I know, it's basic) on a 2017 maxed out iMac and my 2020 m1 Macbook Air. The Macbook Air ate the iMac.

datascience,"About a month ago now, I interviewed for a data analyst internship for a well-known tech company, and another internship for an insurance company. I was officially denied from both last week, and am feeling pretty terrible in general.

For the tech company, the first interview went fine. It was over the phone. The interviewer seemed engaged and I had answers for all of his questions, both technical and behavioral. He also seemed to like and be engaged with my answers. However, the interview was 15 minutes shorter than was planned, which worried me. Despite that, within a couple of days, the company reached out to schedule another interview with another person.

This second interview is where everything went wrong. This interview was also over the phone, but my interviewer called me about 15 minutes late and didn't really seem very engaged. She would yawn while I was speaking and never asked any follow-up questions. I also didn't have nearly as good responses to her questions either. When it got to the technical part of the interview, I screwed up by mentioning that my experience in SQL was only academic experience. This resulted in us skipping over the SQL questions and ending the interview then and there.

I already felt like I was no longer under consideration by the time we hung up, but I was officially rejected last week.

On the other hand, my interviews for the insurance company went spectacularly. The phone screening was great; the interviewer seemed engaged. My second interview was behavioral with two interviewers and went similarly well; they also seemed engaged and responded well to my answers. The technical interview went well too because my interviewer said I had great and thorough answers. Every interview went well. I'm sure of it, because the recruiter said she called me several times, but received no answer. She then emailed me to inform me that they'll be moving on with other candidates because I never responded. The thing is, I never received the calls or emails. I checked all my call logs from now to before the interview, and I never missed any calls. I also searched my inbox and spam box, and couldn't find any email from that company either. So I'm not sure what I could have done.

The tech position didn't go well, and I already knew I lost that position before the interview was even over. But I felt like I nailed the insurance position. I met all the qualifications. I did well in the phone screening, the behavioral interview, and technical interviews. I felt like I did everything right, but somehow, I still screwed up and lost the position.

I'm especially worried because I'm in my third year, so this summer's internship is the one that'll most likely lead to a full-time post-grad position.

I'm currently working one part-time internship with a non-profit, so I'm going to try to get on some projects that are more analysis-related and SQL-related so I could improve my confidence in SQL. I'm also working a very part-time research internship (I'm talking about one or two hours a week) that is analysis/data science-related. I'm nearing the end of that position, but I might try to stick with it for a while longer

I'm in the interview stage for one other internship, but that's it. I could extend my non-profit internship over the summer, but it's not really analysis or data science-related. I'll continue applying to more internships, but right now, that's all I got.

datascience,"Hi, I'm looking to apply some optimization techniques at work to help drive some decisions for some variables we use.  At the moment, their values are mainly from intuition, but I'd like them to be more data driven. 

There are a lot of courses available on machine learning but I haven't come across many on optimization techniques or heuristic search algorithms like tabu and tools that utilize them. I was wondering if anyone has some good recommendations.

datascience,"Need some help and hints. I m from Switzerland and have finished my training as an automation engineer. I did also the vocational high school in technology and science. Now I saw my dream study course [here](https://www.zhaw.ch/de/engineering/studium/bachelorstudium/data-science/) (its in german sry, its Data Science).

In my training of 4 years I have worked with Siemens S7, Tia and a little bit with Linux. In my free time I did sometimes little projects with Arduino, Raspberry pi or with Python but I would still say I m a beginner...

Im not sure if this Data Science is too hard for me because I never had informatics in this topic and also nothing else serious in this subject area. My knowhow about informatics is also not really big. But all this AI, Big Data, Machine learning interests me really hard. At the moment I do a course for Python on Udemy.

Now my question, am I able with my knowledge to do this course?

Does someone have any suggestions what I could do or I should know about it?
