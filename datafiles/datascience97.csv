datascience,"I have a collection of JSON files which represent varying types of objects describing personal data (social media posts, links to images, social media comments, financial transactions, medical data like vaccinations, observations, fitness data like daily steps, achievement, etc).

I am in search of tools that can help a non-programer understand what data is in these files, ideally visualize it and allow some queries to be run. Are there tools that you know of that are capable of this? I've played a little bit with Tableau, but the JSON files don't contain time-series data as there is some nesting of objects and it wasn't quite apparent how to accomplish this without going through mapping and transforming the data first.

Can you think of ways to allow BD people (non programers) to point a tool at a directory and be able to understand (or at least get a sense of) what they are looking at?

Appreciate any pointers / help.

datascience,"The two most common cases I've seen NaN values appear in datasets are either because the data was simply not collected and/or is just missing for no meaningful reason, OR that a ""response"" is not applicable to a feature due to the nature of that specific data point. 

As an example:

|ID|HAS ARTHRITIS|ARTHRITIS LIMITS ABILITY TO WORK|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|yes|yes|
|2|yes|no|
|3|yes|NaN|
|4|no|NaN|

In the table above the values are missing in rows 3 and 4 for different reasons.  Seemingly the value in row 3 Is missing because most likely the data was not collected. However, in row 4, the missing value is due to the feature not being relevant (I.e. we do not need to ask if a patient's arthritis limits their ability to work if they do not have arthritis).  

It would thus seem that in order to make the most accurate model we should not treat these two cases the same.

\# fit random forest model

rf = randomForest(response \~ var\_1 + var\_2 + var\_3 + favorite\_food, data=data, ntree=50, mtry=2) \`\`\`

In this example, you can clearly see that for the ""favorite\_food"" variable. most people either like ""pizza"" or ""ice cream"" - the other categories (e.g. onions, eggplant, etc.) are almost none:

\`\`\` histogram(data$favorite\_food) \`\`\`

[https://imgur.com/a/s8bQ46j](https://imgur.com/a/s8bQ46j)

In this example, it would make sense to ""bin"" (reduce) the ""favorite\_food"" variable into 3 categories : ""pizza"", ""ice cream"" and ""other"". In this example, this is clear - but for bigger and more complex data, this is not always as clear.

Is there a common method in statistics that can be used to automatically ""bin"" variables having many categories, into fewer categories? I was looking into methods such as Factor Analysis ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor\_analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis)) and Latent Class Analysis ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent\_class\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_class_model) ) - but I am not sure if these methods apply to this problem that I am working on.

In my real data, I am also trying to fit a random forest model and I have several categorical variables (e.g. such as favorite\_food) with hundreds of categories.

I then have two separate arrays of the form: [# of people who clicked advertisement, # of people who did not click advertisement].  I then call scipy.stats.chisquare(group_b, f_exp=group_a) to get a final p value.

datascience,"I am currently working on a project in which I have to develop a model to predict how much money other companies will make by using the services provided by my company.  The money made is a type of tax return. The  model should predict a range (e.g 100k$-200k$).

Basically, if I give the model the data of the target company, it will give me how much they can potentially make with us.

The data I have is the financial statements of the companies we worked with. This includes their general and financial data such as capital, number of employees, city, type of industry, and of course the amount of money they made with us.

After researching online, I found that most solutions are forecasting based. While the data I have has the year in which we worked with the clients, I do not think this is the right approach for me. I experimented with decision trees and a regression model but I do not seem to get a good result.

Our company has been acquiring new companies at an increased rate lately, and - where possible and realistic - we're looking to streamline and combine our data streams and ETL process so that our team can be the central data go-to team for reporting.

As a part of this process, we're looking at potential new ETL processes we could adopt, and I'd love some suggestions from other people in the field. 

Currently, we use Visual Studio to manage .dtsx packages where we do the majority of the ETL work. These packages kick off various stored procedures in our SQL servers to load/combine/aggregate data wherever needed.

For the second year in a row, [Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) East](https://opendatascience.com/whats-new-to-odsc-east-2021/) was a must-attend virtual gathering for data scientists. ODSC organizers rightfully noted that while many people are getting burnt out by virtual meetings, developments in the industry dictate that practitioners keep pace with the changes and innovations of the last year.

As such, this year’s conference heavily focused on virtual training. “The field of data science continues to expand, and the demand for individuals with expertise in data, machine learning, and deep learning will continue to grow,” said the conference organizers. The conference featured all the same things you’d get at an in-person event, including training, networking, career advice, and more.

* Automating analyses and authoring pipelines via SQL / python based ETL framework
* Understanding of ETL tools

99% of my current job is done in python. I guess I do a lot of the **E** and the **T** in **ETL**. For example, download data from a SQL database (the **L** part) , clean, dedupe, convert etc. do some models / analysis, (the **T** part I guess?)  and present findings to managemnet. 

I've never done the **L** part of **ETL**.

Im currently an analyst with experience with excel and PBI/PQ, but I’m trying pick up Python to gain increased functionality with some of the projects I work how. I’ve taken someone online classes so I understand the language now. I’m getting to the point where I’m starting to read other people’s notebooks or github repos to try and understand some “real world” applications of the things that I learn.

However, a lot of my projects for work at this point are smaller without a lot of need for scalability. And I’m scratching my head understanding how to structure these projects. For example I’m working on a small project that pulls some data from a source, does some cleaning/transforming in pandas and then write it to an html report and then to a pdf. I’m going to need to repeat this process in the future, but only maybe 3-4 times down the road. The different functions and cleaning process all seems pretty specific to this project. Does it make sense to write this as a self contained script? Or would different portions be written independently and then called from a “centralized” script? Should I have use an actual .py file or does leaving this as a jupyter notebook make more sense? The project is done, I’m just trying to understand how to organize this and other projects better.

datascience,"Hello mates. I've been thinking for a while on how to approach this. Let me give you some context before anything else:
I have an array of piezoelectric sensors inside a vest that will signal analog values to a embd system every interval, lets call it 't'. This sensors will throw data when they are hitted by a BB, when a player crouches, whenever he pick ups something(basically whenever they receive a force).... The value of the analog signal will be as big as the force applied.

My toughts so far are on recording as much data as I can of different scenarios, label it whether the vest was hitted by a BB or not and fit it in an algorithm.

 All I could think about is to use a basic NN and feed it with lets say t, t-1..., t-5 iterations and see how well it does.
