books,"The books specifically are:

1. The Coming of The Third Reich.
2. The Third Reich in Power.
3. The Third Reich at War.

I've plowed through the previous 2, and am 20% through number 3.

The books cover things on various levels. For example, it covers the Nazis and their machinations, before they took power and while they had power, but also the people on the ground and what they were doing or how they were reacting. Also how that also fed into what the Nazis themselves did and why.

It covers the Nazi ideology in-depth and how it manifested in various aspects of society, such as how it affected education. But also how it influenced their plans, especially their plans for WW2, what was done to the occupied territories during WW2, and what was to be done even further to the countries if the Nazis had won.

It is both a deeply informative trilogy on the Nazis...and a deeply human venture. Various characters and individuals' stories are spread out throughout the piece, adding humanity to the overarching narrative rather than being just a tale of massive events with little in the way to color what was experienced by those going through the events.

It's an incredible series.

I would also recommend the audiobooks, as that is how I digested them. But I'm sure reading them would also still provide a powerful experience.",Currently going through The Third Reich Trilogy by Richard J Evans. It has been an incredible experience so far.,1590882669

books,"I promised myself I'd give it 100 pages after buying it because of the hype, but I can't stand this book and feel a lot better dropping it now after reading ABOUT it, which I did not do until now.

I'm a 28-year-old freelance illustrator. I like road trips, I like job flexibility, I like brash decisions to change your life drastically. This book sucks. Over and over it's just poor decision =&gt; self-pity =&gt; fake philosophy =&gt; I got some rest / money from my aunt now I am ON THAT BUS BOY HOWDY. 

God damn.

I get it if the redundancy is supposed to be the thing that I learn - that it's all just a carousel going nowhere for fun, or simply that every adventure has its ups and downs, but this felt a lot more like the pretentious journal of a guy who always has to write himself as the silent wise man. Barf.

Thompson and Vonnegut have WAY more to say on the faded American dream and the sad rat race. Go read The Rum Diary.

Are the other two thirds of this book just as self-aggrandizing, whiny and generic? I'm not trying to find out. I hated The Sun Also Rises and The Great Gatsby for the same reason. Does every single night have to spin into a totally sick, hollerin' romp where the gals are just lovelier than all the stars in the western blah blah fuckin blah.

One good quote every 60 pages just ain't enough for me, I'm switching to Robyn Davidson's Tracks. Paulo Coelho did the real adventure book with The Alchemist, in my opinion. Gulliver's Travels also had so much more going on - even with its tiresome (but purposeful) wordiness and its slow pace - that was a GOOD book. On The Road still has me wondering 'Why am I reading this?' - and I got through Watership Down (also arguably slow in the first half) and I loved it. Want another easy target? I loved The Last Unicorn! That's another great adventure book with real lessons in it. But THIS??

I don't get its association with Catcher In The Rye either. I understand why people don't like that book, but Salinger had a point with that shitty little spoiled brat. The author was saying something to us with Holden and his annoying attitude. On The Road feels like a jerk sesh. A pat on the back about the author himself.

Also had no idea he's French Canadian - that's funny. Always thought of him as an American literary icon. I am looking for quality Road Novels, though, and would welcome recommendations.","""On The Road"" Sucks: 2020",1590880610

books,"Let me preface by saying that I absolutely love dystopian fiction. I've devoured Fahrenheit 451 (I also adored Bradbury's The Illustrated Man), Brave New World, 1984, and other world-famous classics. When I finally got my hands on a copy of The Handmaid's Tale, I was super excited to get sucked into Atwood's world.

However, I'm now almost 150 pages into the book and I just... don't like it. Not because it's too heavy or I can't be bothered to understand all of the Gileadean jargon, but I just don't enjoy what I'm reading. Frankly, I'm finding it boring. 

The most unpleasant part of it all is that Atwood's prose strikes me as way too try-hard. She rambles on with flowery, overly descriptive sentences and references to the past with phrases like ""like it was in the old days, I think"" or things of the sort which make me think of a kid trying to pen her first dystopian short story in middle school.

I also find the heavy Christian allegories quite a bit of a drag to get through. I'm not Christian myself, but I do know enough about it to accept it as a critical element to a story. However, I feel like it's slowing down the world-building in the story. I get that America is a mostly Christian country, the Bible is highly influential in world history and more importantly gender roles, blah blah blah... but for a rendition of the future, it seems like Offred herself doesn't quite understand the society she fits in.

I get that this book is primarily renowned for its overt feminism (which I do appreciate), its criticism of extreme Christian gender roles, and a warning of what society could become. I just feel like there are so many better ways this societal critique could have been represented. I guess I just don't get why so many people like Atwood's writing specifically.",I can't seem to get into The Handmaid's Tale. What's so special about it?,1590878021

books,"Like Bradbury and Vonnegut at their best, I think King got shafted for years but said fuck it ill keep being a writer who classically tries to entertain and evolve. His On Writing finally cemented it in classic humble-brag King fashion. Just the gentle reminder that just because he is int bogged down in deep symbols and themes doesn't mean he doesn't enshrine them into the works. He just doesn't force feed uninterested readers with alienating bolsters of his superiority, because like Dickens he still wants to be accessible to his own generation and average folk. I think its the kind of writing that can still when it is at its best provide places to form respectful criticism of the prevailing attitudes of that time. If you are too inaccessible you are just writing for a few experts in your niches audience praising. I say shag high and low art shop talk, I will rest my King next to my Chekov and Kerouac and Melville etc etc. I esp loved Rita Hayworth and The Body irrespective of the amazing adaptations to the screen, those first encounters showed me King was more than a Koontz or Robin Cook etc. King is sainted sure, but what other living writer takes trump to task with his own gump-ish twainisms? Love him, his writing and his unrelenting love hate of aphorisms and idiomatic regional witticisms. His respect for horror history in Danse Macabre even further posits him with Borges writings on noire and Poe, he revitalizes and renews new generations to Romero and Nostferau and creature features and Wells and Stevenson.

Its obvious to me that the amount of pages you can read in a day is also set by how flowing the writing of the book is, which is probably what mainly contributed to the amount of pages i read. But even still, im proud of it.

What was a time in which you read so many pages that you ended the day with ""Phew, that was intense?"" And how many people read in a language which isnt their native one?","I have just read 300 pages in one day, and not in my native language!",1590861560

books,"I was in particular looking at books concerned with the history of England, and I liked the look of ‘A Short History of England’, by Simon Jenkins. However, the reviews mentioned it omits details of the way of life and cultural movements of ordinary people, while also taking somewhat of a political bias when discussing the present century. 

Does anyone have any recommendations of history books that are not so politically inclined? As I said I was looking for one regarding England, but any and all history fascinates me.",Anyone know of any good unbiased history books?,1590860615

1) Why? Goes without saying but, ebooks don’t incur the same production costs of a physical book, much less a hardcover, so it doesn’t make sense to me.
2) Is it because the book just came out?
3) Do the authors get a bigger cut from ebook sales, in this case? (I wouldn’t mind paying the price then, if that’s the case)",The pricing on eBooks,1590857779

I was advised to read ""The Cruel Prince"" by Holly Black by a few fans of the Grishaverse (Leigh Bardugo series) and while the plot sounds interesting, I am facing up a big pet peeve ( if this the right expression): the book is written in the present tense. 
   It might seems really stupid and shallow but I can't seem to get into the book because of this. I feel like I read a story action by action, therefore there is no fluency in the narration. It lacks a form of rythm if that makes any sense. 

Does anyone feel the same way? Do you like the use of present tense in the naration? Why? Is it a common occurence in english/american litterature?

It's funny how I didn't read it for 5 years and I started it all over again last month. I was determined that I will finish it this time, it was very slow and I took my time. It has a great story, I'm not sure if I have understood everything that the author was trying to convey because the story has so much going on and it was difficult to keep track of characters, at least it was for me. I liked the book and I'm glad I finished it, finally. Maybe I'll give it a read again, in next 5 years when I'm more wise and can understand it better. Haha, just wanted to share.

books,"Riding Rockets is a 2006 memoir written by NASA astronaut Mike Mullane in a very entertaining fashion. He peels away at the bravado of it and lays bare his experiences of trying to get into the NASA astronaut program and all of his experiences with the shuttle program, including of course, riding rockets into space. 

One review of this book mentioned that it is an early look at the NASA program ""warts and all"". I completely agree. Mike Mullane was part of the old NASA that was filled with hotshot pilots that gave away to the ""space cowboy"" stereotype. He is very self aware and some of the stories he tells are critical of himself in that time. 

His childhood, training, military experience, family relationships- everything is fair game. His prose makes you feel like you are on the space shuttle with him launching into space. 

It just has a very authentic feel and thought I would share.","With the SpaceX astronaut launches re-igniting space interest, I highly recommend Riding Rockets by Mike Mullane.",1590848369
