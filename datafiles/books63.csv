books,"I just finished A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. I just picked up reading as a hobby and before this hadn't read since I was 15, so it took me a little over a month to finish this gargantuan book. 

Overall? I'm underwhelmed.

I really did love this book while I was reading it. Promise! Jude, Willem, Malcolm, and JB really pulled at my heartstrings throughout this novel. The complexity of the characters and the influence that is brought upon them by minor characters (i.e., JB making fun of Jude while mirroring Jackson) made them feel real. Like, really real.

The *middle*. Oh my God, the middle of this book had me turning pages like crazy. The night Jude woke up Willem from his sleep. The adoption. Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days. Caleb throwing Jude down the stairwell. Harold finding him. The night Willem catches Jude cutting himself and does it as well.

My favorite part of the middle? The flashbacks to Father Luke. Just when you think that Jude's past couldn't get any worse...the motel, the cabin in the woods, the drive from the monastery. Father Luke is a sick fuck and don't you forget it. But the thought of Jude finding him hanging by an extension cord in the hotel bathroom...he really felt loved by this man. He cried for him while the police pulled him away. Fuck. In my own interpretation, I'm not so sure Jude was ever 100% sure that Willem, Harold, Julia, Malcolm, JB, anyone loved him except for Father Luke. But maybe that's just me.

Jude is the only character I have seen anywhere that mirrors how I felt when I was deeply suicidal. You will never understand the monster you become when you are forced to stay alive by others. Even now, years after these thoughts plagued me, I cannot imagine the things I said and did. You feel like you have nothing to live for, and so you let the part of you that wants to fuck up everyone's life as much as your own out. Jude getting mad and yelling at Julia and Harold. His frustration when they didn't scream back. I felt all of it. 

Then Harold waving goodbye to Jude in the cab, saying *don't you dare do it.* If only I could tell myself that now. I'm forever thankful I never went through with it but holy shit, I missed it by a hair.

The car ride with India. and Malcolm and Willem. Kill me now.

The last chapter, Harold's POV, felt rushed. I mean, it didn't leave any ends untied but it felt like Yanagihara was trying to get this thing over with. I'm not sure. It just felt like she was trying to get rid of everybody in those last few pages. But poor JB. Poor, poor JB.",I just finished 'A Little Life',1604945380

books,"My way:

Pick a book. Deep breath. Make sure there are no other things clouding my mind. Then begin.

If the paragraph is heavily descriptive, I take probably more than enough time to read it slowly and create the visuals in my mind, whether it be locations, architecture, the look of a character and so on. I am a major filmmaking enthusiast, so camera angles are the only way I can imagine these visual settings. I try to make it as visually pleasing as possible. I try to act out the dialogue most of the time, and it gets very dramatic once scenes get juicy.

But it's even more exciting when the descriptions explain things that can't be visually shown; here I try to associate it with and try to remember the feelings. 

There is always movement in my imaginations, or else it does not involve me in with the scene.

And then, after I read a chapter, I sit back and think about what happened in it.

The problem with all this is, the slightest distraction annoys the hell out of me, gets me right out of the zone. But, then I repeat it again or throw the book away.

Do you have any methods or hints? i know it might not be necessary to keep in mind the details of a novel book but i feel kinda bad when i cant remember even the most important points of a book that ive just read and it feels like ive wasted my time, also i wanna be able to explain what ive learnt from that book if anyone asks my opinion. Another problem is that there're a lot of books out there,i dont know if i can really manage to keep a lot of info in my mind about every single one of them. Should i  take notes then?what do you suggest me to do?",How can i stick it in my mind?,1604933093
books,"To begin, my only experience with Shirley Jackson is ""The Lottery"", which I read in school twice and did assignments on. I've always been aware of *Haunting of Hill House* and its reputation, but never actually read it. I finally took the plunge when my local library opened back up and I saw it on the shelf. 

I know it's a 61-year-old novel and I should keep in mind it's a product of its time. I also knew I shouldn't have expected a bloody, gory, jump-scare mess either. It started off fine with introducing Hill House and the main characters. I even liked the early interactions with the arrival at Hill House and the mini tour. But from it felt like...not a lot happened? 

A few of the big problems for me:

1. Eleanor and Theo seem like children, not adults. The book explicitly states Eleanor is 32 years old, but she comes across as this young girl who giggles, teases, and daydream plays with Theo when they explore the house and garden together. Theo has a lot of these same characteristics. 
2. Luke feels really underdeveloped. He's a distant heir to the home and it's mentioned his aunt doesn't trust him and thinks he'll steal from the house or just outright sell it once it's his...but he never displays any of these characteristics or traits in the story? In fact, he seems to join in with the ""kiddish"" vibe Elle and Theo gave off. 
3. The doctor's wife and her companion just seem to show up at the end and rush to a conclusion? Okay...

To end this on somewhat of a positive, I also grabbed *We Have Always Lived In The Castle* on my library trip, so I'm hoping for something better with that one.",I finally read Shirley Jackson's Haunting of Hill House...and I'm underwhelmed?,1604932569

books,"One of my professors told me to read Bruno Shultz last year and I am so blessed to have witness such splendor in my life. He is extraordinary! Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass has been on my mind ever since I read it and I have read it multiple times.

Has any of you read his works? What did you guys think of him? Did you guys note anything unusual or authentic about his writing?

I would really love to know what others who have read him think of his work!",Magic of Bruno Shultz,1604927353

books," F - Forget, when your learning a new material always learn as if you do not know anything about it. Learn with a open mind. If a thought comes up while learning, forget abt it unless its important then you want to write it down on a notebook. Last is be positive, don't say that your not good enough to learn this.  
A - Act. Learning is not a passive experience so try and do as much while learning like taking notes down or discuss it with friends.  
S - State. Consist of psychology and physiology. Choose states of joy and curiosity when learning. Have a posture that gets you excited and a lot of energy to learn. Even practice taking deep breaths to help you relax.  
T - Teach You learn twice when you teach it to someone, whenever your doing a presentation on something you would want to master the material right? So that you would be able to explain it to someone, there it motivates you to learn deeplyE - Enter. Ever had important appointments? You should make a schedule to learn and put an exciting label on it. Eg, self developing, brain training.  
R - Review. In order to remember what you've learn you should always review it several days so that your brain will value the material more to help you remember (space repetition).
