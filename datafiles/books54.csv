books,"That's right I'm going back to my school life of reading along to an audiobook recording. Except this time it will be on my own terms, so that means no stopping every 5-freakin'-pages to discuss sentence structure and character motivations as a group!

To start I want to say that I reccomend those that haven't to absolutely check out this series! I started reading them after finishing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt which is part of a video game trilogy that acts as unofficial (yet equally amazing) sequels to the books. Without a doubt it's my favorite fantasy saga with the second book Sword of Destiny being my favorite book of all time. The series actually reignited my passion to read again and to build myself a physical collection of books as e-readers or the Kindle app doesn't feel the same as holding the pages yourself.

So for this reading marathon, I wanted to do something different. I wanted to read along with the audiobook format. I have to say, my first impressions are quite positive. Once you get used to the reading speed it adds a new layer of immersion to the story and creates a better sense of pacing.

What about you all? Have you tried this or do you prefer the quiet of reading to yourself? Me? I don't like outside noises like the TV going while I read. However, I tend to get restless if things are quiet for too long. I think having the audiobook to read along with creates a good middle ground to not only focus my concentration on the book longer but also creates noise that actually pertains to what I'm doing.",Re-Reading Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher Series.

books,"Just general question, 95% of people who are incredible at school, the type that don't have to study and do incredible on tests they always hate reading and consider it a waste of time. All of these people when they see me reading a book like "" The Castle, Infinite Jest, or Blood Meridian "" Ask me "" why are you reading outside of school? "" It's like they don't understand people get enjoyment out of reading or find these stories fascinating, or enjoy the symbolism, or the mirror fictional literature, holds up and reflects back to society. 

Only thing I can come up with is that school has trained 80+ % of the population to hate reading, case in example is all the books we read in school are just turned into homework, and turn books into "" HERES THIS QUESTION PLEASE FIND THE ANSWER ON CHAPTER 7 "" I find most of my friends that love to read hated school and all it did was crush there creativity. The people I usually find that are good at school, don't understand abstraction or symbolism in the arts, or just have no interest whatsoever in any of that.

Obviously my experience could be entirely  different from everyone elses but I find this to be a consistent theme in the people who love to read and the people who only read for school, and are really good at school, and watch reality tv/ or just trash tv in general.

books,"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting on here, and I feel so motivated and happy that I'd figure I'd post something about my recent experience. 

For the past 3 years I have not read a single book (not counting anything college/university related), because I got really lazy, I got distracted way too much with anything whilst trying to read, and I just really didn't feel like reading as I did in the past...

With all that's been going on with the pandemic in my country (Bolivia), and the fact that I am recovering from a herniated disk, I thought that there isn't a better time than now to get back into reading. 

It's been a month since I started reading again, and I just finished my 5TH BOOK today!! I'm just amazed for the fact that I read so much in just a month, after many years of not reading anything for pleasure.

I've been loving books about huge companies and their origins or leaders, like The Ride of a Lifetime by Bob Iger, To Pixar and Beyond by Lawrence Levy, or The Airbnb Story by Leigh Gallagher. I absolutely recommend this books, they are fascinating!

But well, I guess the meaning of my post is to never give up on books, no matter the situation. I found myself that the best way to get back into reading is to read again one of your absolute favorite books, and that'll get the train going!

books,"I‚Äôve seen this book, and Coelho‚Äôs work in general, get a lot of hate on Reddit, which bothers me because it‚Äôs one of my favorite books. Admittedly, I haven‚Äôt read any other of Coelho‚Äôs works, but here I‚Äôll try to address a lot of the criticisms of the Alchemist I‚Äôve seen on this site.

I think the main criticism the book receives is that its message impractical and too idealistic. To this I‚Äôll say that I don‚Äôt think Coelho wants the reader to ascribe to the belief that if you follow in pursuit of your dreams then the world will conspire to ensure that you will achieve that dream in its totality. Anyone over the age of 13 has realized that simply following your dreams with no backup plan or side hustle is a terrible idea especially in a capitalist society. I think Coelho recognizes this, and is instead trying to just remind us that we shouldn‚Äôt completely give up on our dreams. 

Furthermore, I‚Äôm not sure if the book even necessarily argues that if you pursue your dreams relentlessly then someday they will come true. This is a huge spoiler but at the end of the book the protagonist has yet to find his treasure and returns to the citadel where the story begins in defeat. However when he returns, there he finds his treasure. It‚Äôs possible that Coelho isn‚Äôt trying to persuade us the following our dreams will lead to us achieving them, but rather the experience we gain from chasing after that dream is very beneficial to our growth as human beings. Not just that, but he may be trying to spark a conversation around what makes a life a ‚Äúgood‚Äù life. Is it better to live simply in security, or pursue some ambition and even in failure have learned a lot on the way and have grown as a person? 

The other critique I see thrown at the Alchemist is that there is no depth in character. I think the rebuttal to this statement is quite simple: it‚Äôs primarily a philosophical book. Coelho isn‚Äôt a Shakespeare or a Fitzgerald, he‚Äôs much more akin to a Plato or a Machiavelli. The Alchemist reminds me a lot of Candide and Rasselas, where characters don‚Äôt have a lot of depth and are usually very temporary and inconsequential to the plot, often appearing and then quickly disappearing once they served their purpose, but that‚Äôs because in philosophically driven books secondary characters only serve to impart wisdom on the protagonist and amplify the message of the book. Thus, I don‚Äôt think this is a fair criticism of the book. It‚Äôs like saying jazz is bad because the musicians often don‚Äôt play the ‚Äúright notes‚Äù. One of the main attributes of jazz is that it is unconventional, experimental, and is based off of many atypical scales not found in classical or more conventional types of music.

However philosophical books like these are very reliant on the stage one is in in their life. I‚Äôm only 18. I‚Äôm at a point where I need to start figuring out what I want to do with my life and what direction I want to go in, so a book that inspires me to dig deep into what I want from life resonates a lot with me. I recognize though that my opinion on this book may change once I enter my late 20s when I‚Äôm more mature.

The first two books go together in terrific fashion and probably pay homage to historically significant books that I hadn't/haven't read yet. The last two are an epic space opera I have yet to see topped!

After stumbling across Brosh‚Äôs first social media post in several years, I think this is perhaps the fastest I‚Äôve ever pre-ordered anything. As a young adult, I loved the Hyperbole and a Half blog and accompanying book, so I was excited to experience her writing again in a whole new context. 

I was blown away by this book. It had that warm and familiar wit that always made me laugh. Stories like ‚ÄúThe Pile Dog‚Äù (Part 1 and 2) had me howling and her ridiculous illustrations were the icing on the cake. 

What really impressed me, though, was how her style has really matured over time. Brosh had gone through some personal tragedies since the release of her last book. Her honest self-reflection and way of writing so openly about her experiences (despite being a self-proclaimed recluse who likes to stay out of the public eye) was really inspiring. As someone who also lost someone close to me to suicide, I found her pieces about her sister to be so relatable and captured feelings that I always had a hard time expressing. 

Overall, the book struck a great balance between being hilarious, touching, and vulnerable. I thought it was fantastic and well worth the wait.

books,"It was excellent. I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about science and anyone who wants to truly understand what evolution is. I know too many people who think evolution is just ""monkeys giving birth to humans""... wish they'd read this book. 

If science isn't your strong suit then the book is still worth the read. Although I wouldn't say I struggle with science, it isn't my strong suit either. I have taken some university level science courses and found myself struggling at times with 2 of the chapters. The biomorph land chapter was the first, but I understood his point perfectly but the end of the chapter. I think the other was the second last chapter(?). Either way the book is worth getting if you're not very science literate, he writes the book with long drawn-out explanations on purpose. These can get tedious after a while though.

The book spoke to me like no other. Pulled me into the story like I was there . Made me want to keep reading but at the same time a small part of me wanted to stop because I was afraid of what was going to happen . Over everything else,  it made me feel everything. 

And since I have finished reading it , I have craved to share its experience. I shall tell no more ,to bring no spoilers. But this has to be one of the best stories ever written.",The Book Thief,1600955901

books,"So my girlfriend absolutely adores Jane Austen. I'm talking she took an entire college course about her and loved every second of it, all 6 of her novels are in her top 10 favorite novels of all time, and I've listened to her talk about Austen for hours and I can honestly listen for hours more. Her eyes just light up when she talks about her novels and it's the cutest thing. 

But onto the topic at hand, I want to get her a birthday present related to Jane Austen or maybe even Louisa May Alcott as Little Women is her favorite book and favorite movie and she named her cats Louisa and May. 

I have no idea what to get her though. Is there something we can do or somewhere we can go or something I can get her? I'm just completely lost as to what to do and I need help.",Need Help Getting Gift for Bookworm Girlfriend!,1600955584

I love to read, but i am finding that my book collection is growing bigger than my living space. I want to make the switch to e-readers.

Which one do you guys recommend? 

Also, when I buy the ebook I own the file correct? (it will be in my e-reader for as long as I want it to?)

My budget is anywhere from 100-200$

books,"Now and again I like to test myself and read a book which I think is fair to say, completely out of my comfort zone intellectually. 

Examples of books I've read recently which I find more difficult to read: Edgar Allen Poe's short stories, The Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller, The Bloody Chamber by Angela Carter. 

I am able to recognise that the language used is on another level but sometimes I find it difficult to appreciate or comprehend and it can get a bit tiring. Sometimes I feel like it just goes over my head. 

I really want to be able to read books like this more and I suppose poetry too, but that's maybe a question for another day. 

Does anyone have any tips on how I can enjoy this and appreciate complex language a bit more?
