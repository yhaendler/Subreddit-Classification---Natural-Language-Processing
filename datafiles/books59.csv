books,"  

Hi everyone! I finished reading Krasznahorkai's Satantango a couple of days ago and found it to be utterly brilliant. It was definitely one of the best books I have ever read. It was difficult to parse out what the author was trying to do, but after re-reading passages and taking notes, I have come to my own interpretation of it. For anyone who may have been confused as well, or simply seeking some other viewpoint, I thought I'd post my original blog post here as well! It's lengthy, but I honestly couldn't find a way around that given the book's complexity. I hope to hear your thoughts after! Here's a link to the original: [https://watchreadgame.com/satantango-novel/](https://watchreadgame.com/satantango-novel/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Satantango, The Novel Explained**

### introduction

Laszlo Krasznahorkai’s novel *Satantango* concerns itself with the destitute lives of the residents living in a decrepit, rain-drenched Hungarian estate. He writes the novel using winding, multi-part, sometimes page-long sentences that almost act as a dialogue when no one is speaking. Instead, the sentences speak to themselves, discussing the themes, correcting the earlier moments, or arguing with one another. Krasznahorkai expertly uses the plot to set the basis for the thematic material.

On the surface, he is writing a novel about the failed Totalitarian Communist leadership present in Hungary at the time. The story is about those irreverent citizens, living as drunks and cheaters, who live like this because the government is now unconcerned with them as they pose no use following the downfall of their industry. Often, I read about people who question the book’s purpose or writing style. They wonder what it’s about or if the sentences and paragraphs serve any importance other than the author being pretentious. I hope this article gives a little insight into why I believe this book is absolutely important and why it serves a much greater purpose than what may be apparent. This whole article will contain SPOILERS.

### the events

Before delving into the thematic material to help explain *Satantango*, it is important to have an understanding of the overarching plot within. The citizens of the estate are living in squalor and perpetual drunkenness. They cheat on wives and husbands, leave their children to prostitute themselves, and drink the mornings, days, and nights away to pass the time. The estate they live on was once some sort of agricultural industry. Now that it is useless, the government has given up on this community, leading to their current state of living. Their indifference leads to the suicide of a young girl, Esti.

Thus enters Irimias. Irimias is literally a government worker – an informer of sorts. But he represents other entities: the totalitarian state, the material form of Satan, or a foreshadowing of a fascist capitalist state. He leads them to believe he is bringing them to a literal Eden, and instead (without their knowledge) tears them from their homes and sets them to work as spies. They believe they are going to work for certain individuals while Irimias builds his Eden, but instead, they will report on those they are working for. It ends with the Doctor of the estate hearing the same ringing bell Futaki heard at the beginning and deciding to write their story.

### part 1: nihilism

The theme of nihilism is present throughout the novel. Nihilism is the belief that life (or things you do in life) are meaningless – that there is no point in morality, love, or enjoyment. I will use nihilism to set a quick basis for what I believe the purpose of the novel was. *Satantango* opens and closes with the ringing of a bell. When Futaki hears it in the first few pages of the novel, to us it calls to mind some higher power. It makes us wonder, are heavens gates opening? is it signaling the coming of some angel or prophet? Well, a religious person (or someone who believes in signs) would believe it was a sign from God, but here is what comes to Futaki’s mind:

&gt;*… and he saw himself nailed to the cross of his own cradle and coffin, painfully trying to tear his body away, only, eventually, to deliver himself — utterly naked, without identifying mark, stripped down to essentials — into the care of the people whose duty it was to wash the corpses, people obeying an order snapped out in the dry air against a background loud with torturers and flayers of skin, where he was obliged to regard the human condition without a trace of pity…*  
*pg. 4*

Instead of thinking of something beautiful, what comes to his mind is thoughts of death and the meaninglessness of life. He is presented with God and thinks of the Devil. It is almost as if he is seeking this pain, or these “torturers and flayer of skin”.

But who else hears the bell? The Doctor, or the narrator of the entire work. The book ends with him writing down the first few pages of this novel, signifying his authorship or the work. Before getting into his experience with the bell, it is important to see his worldview as well. Far before his hearing of the bell, he sits and watches the people of the town. He thinks:

&gt;*… he was lost in successive waves of time, coolly aware of the minimal speck of his own being, seeing himself as the defenseless, helpless victim of the earth’s crust, the brittle arc of his life between birth and death caught up in the dumb struggle between surging seas and rising hills, and it was as if he could already feel the gentle tremor beneath the chair supporting his bloated body, a tremor that might be the harbinger of seas about to break in on him, a pointless warning to flee before its all-encompassing power made escape impossible, and he could see himself running, part of a desperate, terrified stampede comprising stags, bears, rabbits, deer, rats, insects and reptiles, dogs and men, just so many futile, meaningless lives in the common, incomprehensible devastation, while above them flapped clouds of birds, dropping in exhaustion, offering the only possible hope.*  
*pg. 59*

Again, like Futaki, his world view holds on to some meaninglessness of life. He sees himself as a small part of a pointless world, as a speck of time that comes out to experience something insignificant while hills rise and sink before him. He views life as a simple waiting game for death, and that death is “the only possible hope”.

Finally, to drive this point of nihilism home, now I can get at what the Doctor experiences when he sees the bell. Again, it should come to mind that a bell would usually signify something grand and beautiful, but when he arrives at its source, there is some disfigured creature speaking in incomprehensible bursts, and we are uncertain if it is even human. It is not some god ringing the bell, and it is not even the devil. It doesn’t matter what it is as long as we know it is something grotesque, something that is suffering through life performing menial pointless tasks, just as the townspeople seem to be doing.

### part 2: the estate

Now to tie this theme of nihilism into the bigger picture. Futaki and the Doctor open and close the novel – they present us with most of the book’s philosophy – but they rarely play a big part in the central moments. Esti, as young as she is, already seems to deny the importance or beauty of life, and instead seeks solace in death. She kills her cat and then herself, waiting for a guardian angel to come and take her up. But at one point, in the book’s very few paragraph breaks (and the only one that isn’t breaking for a song or list or prayer) Esti is thinking:

&gt;*… she could sense their presence without seeing them, she knew they were there, that she was facing*  
*them*  
*down there,*  
*pg. 109*

Esti is literally viewing her family and village members from a higher place. She could be acting as the only source of good throughout the book, watching over them from a vantage point, some metaphorical sense of heaven maybe. It is no coincidence that Krasznahorkai chose to break this line up. He wanted us to think on this line as a metaphor or something more important. Down there calls to mind viewing Earth from above, like an angel or a god. She may be acting as a guardian angel over the entire estate, yet as she watches over it all she remembers her mother’s words to her – “There’s nothing for you here!” It sets in motion her nihilistic beliefs; she comes to realize the lies the town and even her brother tell her; apathy sets in. Esti kills herself and the town loses its guardian angel.

The loss of this angel is what gives Irimias a way to enter, but first we see the outcome of this loss at the bar. There are no redeeming qualties expressed in this chapter, just drunkeness, cheating, anger. The rain pours down onto the bar as if foreshadowing some apocalypse. And most importantly, the spiders weave their webs on these still living, breathing inhabitants. The spiders give them a symbolic sense of the dead – yet even they refuse to stay with these “corpses” and their immorality – and then retreat back to their holes.

### part 3: the journey

As I said, Esti’s death (or more accurately, the failings of the townspeople to protect her) opens a doorway or a purpose for the devil to come into their lives. It calls to mind a sort of Faustian bargain. Maybe an unwilling or an unspoken one for the townspeople, but still similar. They are promised an Eden and so set to destroying their former homes and leaving the decrepit estate. But this is all lies as the devil is wont to do. They are sent out to “work” for certain individuals, believing that one-day Irimias will come back for them to present this Eden. But the devil (or maybe he is simply a minion of the devil) is just using them to learn – to spy for his master, which as presented in Part One Chapter 2, happens to be the Totalitarian bureaucracy of the Hungarian government.

Does this new work give their lives purpose? Will their conditions of living improve? Will they receive some sort of satisfaction with their work, or some hope that something better is coming – an Eden? It is all possible but hard to believe. They had a purpose before on their estate, but once their use had run out, they were forgotten and most likely will be again. Likely, they will revert back into alcohol or some other vice as a means of passing time and forgetting; they will bribe, steal, cheat, and fight. They may hope or set their sights on some other Christ figure, maybe this time one who is not in disguise. But as their story closes, it feels as if that thought is absurd.

### conclusion: hope

*Satantango* is obviously highly nihilistic and provides a horribly pessimistic worldview, but it does give hope. Krasznahorkai gives us scenes that provide some solace or comfort that there is something that matters, whether from a religious, artistic, or social perspective. In the scene when Esti’s corpse (or soul?) is rising above the fog seeming to be taken to heaven, Irimias cowers. He is seeing the innocent saved and brought to what is a real Eden. There is light and beauty after death, and maybe that shows him it is possible before death as well. The Doctor finds comfort in writing, in art. He finishes his chapter having possibly found a true purpose in cataloguing the lives of these souls. Or maybe his comfort is in providing some form of social commentary in showing what his country has done to its citizens.

That is what I believe the purpose of *Satantango* is. It is pessimistic and depressing and bleak, but Krasznahorkai is not saying that life is meaningless or that death is the only exit. He does not think humanity is a pointless dot in eternity. What he is doing is showing what happens when people are forgotten. He is criticizing his government and country for allowing life to reach such low levels. It is social commentary but not heavy-handed, blatant allegory – rather it is art at its peak. It provides us with a tapestry of never-ending thoughts, paragraphs, and sentences, taking stream-of-conscious to a more philosophic and meaningful level. His descriptions of life, sunrises, and rain, are written in some of the most touching and unique prose I have ever read. In his sentences we see beauty in even the most desperate creatures, a light in the dingiest of bars and hovels, and all they need to flourish is a little help.

books,"Because of quarantine, I've been (finally) reading for fun again, and I've noticed some differences in my reading experience as an adult vs. as a teenager. With that, I've also noticed some differences between how I experience a book vs. how I experience a movie. 

1. I dream move vividly when I read books. I'm usually a huge cinephile, binging 2-3 movies a night if I can. But I noticed that in the month that I've picked up reading books again, I've been having much more quirky and complex dreams that stay with me the next day. This didn't happen when I binged watched movies or a show. Books seems to put me in a different head space. They also exhaust me much more than movies, so I go to bed much more mentally fatigued.
2. Reading is private. I’ll have created a whole world and cast of characters in my head, with no proof of them having existed outside of my mind. No one knows how much interpretation of the fictional world looks like but me. I think it's also why I don't remember books as well as I remember movies. I would go through my ""read"" list on goodreads and see titles that I don't remember ever reading. I guess it’s hard to remember something that never truly existed outside our minds. 
3. Reading is intimate. When I read, I can see Elizabeth Bennett while also *being* inside Elizabeth Bennett's head. But when I watch a movie, I see Keira Knightley playing Elizabeth Bennett. It’s one degree removed (i.e., diegesis vs. mimesis).  
I also don’t feel like I have to look over my shoulder, or be afraid that someone is going to burst into my room and catch me watching something racy and scandalous. The images are hidden in the words and pages. 
4. For the same reason, reading makes me forget about myself. I become the characters and I emerge from the books in a daze. I forget where I end and where the characters begin. When watching movies, I’m very aware of who I am and how I measure up to the actors on the screen. 
5. I feel more in control when I read. I can control the speed at which I consume a book. I can plow through a 200-page book in a night if it interests me enough, or I can read it over 2 days, a week, a month, or even a year. I can hold the book/ebook in my hands and will myself to go faster. You can control the speed of an audiobook (and I guess you can control the playback speed of movies too). But it just feels like there’s more agency when reading a book, from how your construct the characters in your mind, to how you pace yourself. 
6. An obvious comparison is that of length. Books are definitely longer because 1) there are usually more scenes and 2) the scenes are more drawn out and filled with descriptions of what the characters are thinking and feeling. BUT, what I think that films do that books arguably don’t do as effectively, is use setting and movement to paint a story. I think of noir films from the 1940s like Casablanca where Rick is often cast in half light and half shadow to reflect his inner conflict that he has in having to choose between the woman he loves and his duty to his country. I think about Wong Kar Wai’s In the Mood for Love where Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung’s characters pass each other silently in the narrow stairwell of their apartment building, an sexually-charged, intimate, claustrophobic, but contact-less interaction that symbolizes longing and loneliness. 

Obviously, both mediums have their strengths. I'm curious to hear about other thoughts about the differences between books and films (whether experiential or technical).

For most of the book, I was on the edge of my seat while reading.  I had to take some breaks now and then because it felt too intense.

It is horrifying how much idiocy exists amongst the most powerful class in America. The only people likely to have the patience for this are hard-core baseball fanatics.

books,"Let me preface this by saying I understand that some people love this book and that is cool. Tastes differ and that's great! 

I picked it up and just could not read beyond a certain point. The writing feels overtly verbose, pretentious and frankly boring to me. 

I just read 3 pages of a character babbling about a vision he had - a vision which has nothing to do with the plot. And then there are all the architectural descriptions. I just don't care about how many sides a building has and how its arches are constructed. Certainly not enough to read paragraphs on paragraphs of it. 

It's the first book in a long time that I've DNFed so violently (I actually went, ""Jesus, who cares about this shit?""). 

Am I missing something here? I like long winded philosophical discourse. I don't mind verbosity. But this book comes off as incredibly smug and pretentious especially because it chooses to babble about details that just do not matter and feels like Eco is fellating his own genius.",The Name of The Rose is the first time I've put down a book while cursing out loud.,1603075453

The ending made me think a lot about desperation, hope, and the nature of humanity.  The breastfeeding image in the last paragraph reminded me a lot of the theme of a mother's milk in Beloved by Toni Morrison (""they took my milk"").  Both have a mother in terrible terrible circumstances, and the strength that both Rosasharn and Sethe portray is really inspiring.

I felt the magic system was unique in that it always kept you at arm's length. You could see that the characters were progressing in their magic and transforming into something other, but the whole process or system was never really explained. I enjoyed that though because I imagined that's what the characters largely felt at first, a kind of muddled confusion.

I was a bit disappointed and confused by the ending so I would love someone else's take on what happened. I was looking forward to reading the next book in the series, but it unfortunately hasn't been translated yet.","""Vita Nostra"" by Marina and Sergey Dyachenko",1603069741

books,"I'm 23 and I'm not ashamed to say that I still read books in the middle grade and young adult sections. This is not the problem. I don't want to leave these books behind completely. However, I find that a lot of the types of young adult books that I used to love in middle school and high school no longer interest me. I have read books marketed to adults that I have loved, but I find that I often have a problem. I'm not in high school anymore and I can't relate to a lot of those problems, but I'm also not married or settled down. I don't believe that you have to relate to every book that you read, but I still crave books with relatable characters and I'm finding it hard to find stuff. I know that New Adult exists, but it's hard to find books marketed for that age that aren't about college or aren't a rom com. (I like romance, but not when it's the whole book. And I don't enjoy detailed sex. I prefer the YA book sex where they just focus on the emotions, but I'd prefer it with adult characters as it's getting weirder and weirder to read about teens having sex as I get older. Lol.)

I don't know if I'm making any sense. But I'm changing as a person and a lot of what I found satisfying before no longer is. I feel like I'm in an ""in between"" stage where I feel like my tastes lie half in YA and half in adult.

books,"Just wanted to vent, because I’m reading this about a year after I read The Handmaid’s Tale, which hit the right balance of mystery, dystopia, and social commentary for me (loved how dreadful “The Wall” was).   

Now, I’m about 2/3 through Testaments and I’m rather bored with it. THT felt mature and serious, with the oppressive atmosphere weighing down on Offred.  Gilead was forbidding and all-powerful, and I loved that I didn’t know the scope of their domain.  Now in The Testaments, they’re training a high school girl in martial arts so that she can infiltrate Gilead and obtain secret documents that will blow the whole operation up in smithereens.  It just feels like someone else wrote a YA novel set in the same universe.

Does this have something to do with the TV series having been produced (haven’t watched it, nor will I bother if it’s more like TT than THT) and Atwood being influenced by it?",Disappointed in The Testaments,1603065900

I'm still amazed at how McCullough makes Ancient Rome so engaging. There's multiple characters that have the same name, but she makes each of them distinct. Seeing characters that have been in the series for the last 4-5 books meet their demise hit me harder than I was expecting. I mean, this is actual history so it's not like I didn't see it coming. Caesar's death in particular struck me since it's implied &gt;!that he was actually looking forward to dying due to being worn out from everything.!&lt; The last few hundred pages deal with the rise of Octavian and TBH, I found him one of the most interesting characters in the series. If Caesar is fire, than Octavian is ice. He has similarities with Caesar (which he does intentionally), but he's far more ruthless.

**TL;DR: I was feeling kind of low and wanted to go to the happiest place, book-wise. For me, that would be Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine. What is yours, and why?**

I love reading. Since I was a kid, my childhood was surrounded by books, and I think they helped me in lots of ways: I love reading all sorts of things (genre-wise), I love everything they taught and teach me (about life, sentiments, even grammar and vocabulary), I love the fact that they blow up my immagination and allow me to travel to all sort of places and meet all sorts of people and creatures... I don't know how else to describe it, but you know what I mean. Their smell, the sound the page makes when you turn it, reading till you have to turn the lamp on because the sun has come down; all the laughing, fear, joy, mystery, tears... it's just so wonderful I cannot find the words, at least not at all different than you probably already read elsewhere o feel for yourself.

Thing is, for me today was one of these days that you simply want to escape from reality, and my desire was to go to a happy place. So after all this rumbling, may I ask you, what is your happy place, book-wise?

For me, it would be Dandelion Wine, by Ray Bradbury. That book is just... happiness, all around. The summer, the children, the dandelions, the wine, the infinite summer nights, the adventures, the innocence, the joy of a new pair of shoes, the singing, the playing all day up until sunset, the family all together... I immediately knew that, if I was feeling kind of low, that would be the happiest place I could go to to make myself feel better. Besides, I would really like to aknowledge Bradbury as an author, I love his writing! In my opinion, he has wrote great books. But that would be another thread.

So, thanks to all of you who read this and are willing to share with the rest of this great sub which is the happiest place in their shelves. Everyone has their own experience and that's the good thing! It doesn't have to be a book similar to the one I chose. Also, sorry if I made any mistakes while writing, english is not my first language. However, Dandelion Wine is one of the first books I read in english! So it gets extra points for that, too :).",A Book That Makes You Happy,1603057299

books,"I'm a dad of a girl, 6, and we've got a pretty good routine going of reading before bed every night. I read out loud to her some of my old favorites (Roald Dahl, Charlotte's Web, etc) as well as some newer books that she loves (Ivy and Bean, etc.). I recently found my sister's old box set of Laura Ingalls Wilder books and thought it'd be fun to read with my daughter. They're classics which I've never read, so I thought it would be a great experience for both of us.

I was quickly disillusioned when halfway into the first chapter of the first book (Little House in the Big Woods), she goes on a lengthy and extremely (extremely!) detailed description of the father bringing home, butchering, and preserving the meat of a pig. While this isn't an issue of me wanting to hide the details of where meat comes from, it is not at all what I was expecting from the very beginning of a classic children's book!

My question is... is the entire series like this? Based on the first chapter, it seems less like a narrative and more like a very factual, blow-by-blow account of what life was like for the author.
