datascience,"Could be quarantine or zoom fatigue setting in, but lately it's felt like I just don't want to put in so much effort any more. Granted, I'm in a senior position (and maybe I just don't want the responsibility) at a startup, and the majority of my career has been in startups. I find myself waking up everyday just waiting for the weekend


I'm thinking that in the next year or two I would really like to take a slower pace, where I wouldn't have to juggle so much or have so much riding on my projects. I've done a whole lot of studying and improving on the side for years, in stats/ML but also development, and I kind of just want to relax a bit. Originally I was going to shoot for management roles down the line but I don't think it's for me.


Anyway, I know the first step would probably be to get out of startups, generally. I've read government and banking are a couple of more relaxed choices. How are the big tech companies in this regard? I know some of the open DS positions are more analytics, which is slightly concerning given that I like the development side a more, but I might be okay with it. Just want to collect a paycheck and feel more at ease


Alternatively, there could be paths that aren't entirely data science but data-related. I did do some SEM work years ago that I find interesting, so that could be something.


Anyways, generally feeling unmotivated to continue advancing in the field and want to pull back a bit and take a breather. Anyone have experience with transitioning to a more relaxed industry/role?",Relaxed work environments or alternatives for DS?,1617575512

**A little context**

Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter or Reddit can be  represented as dynamic temporal communities. Temporal networks consist  of snapshots, representing the state of the network within a given  time-frame (for example: nodes = Reddit users, edges = interactions  between users, time-frame = 15 minutes). The easiest method to employ  community detection on temporal networks is to apply any static  community detection algorithm (such as Louvain) on each snapshot and  extract the static communities - then use them to extract various  information.

**The problem**

I sampled a dataset consisting of all Reddit comments on the politics  subreddit 2 days before and 3 days after Biden's inauguration. I chose a time-frame size of 15 minutes. The problem is **any two snapshots in this dataset have a really  small number of shared nodes, let's say less than 10% of each's  snapshot's total number of nodes**. Thus, my snapshots form separate, stand-alone static communities rather than a temporal network.

**So, is this normal? Is there any way to sample a set of comments in order to maximize the shared nodes number?**

**Is there a recommended minimum number of shared nodes between snapshots in temporal community detection?**",Recommended minimum number of shared nodes between snapshots in temporal community detection,1617554942

datascience,"Hello Community,

So, I was fortunate enough to be in one of the first generations to directly study data science in my area (even though I was learning towards that field years ago while studying physics).

Now I have been working for a few years and....it’s cool. I mean I do my little Python scripts, cool graphs, setup Spark clusters, run my data driven web apps to production on a Kubernetes cluster, write my retrieval algorithms for my little data warehouse, and will tinker around with AI a bit to see if I can improve it further later this year.

Overall I could call myself a happy “little bit of everything” data scientist, yay :)

Now I wanted to move away from business and production and more towards the “science” part in our job description: I want to do research (well that’s my root coming from physics anyway I guess).

And while trying to get there I had a bitter realization: I have no freaking idea how a computer works or what I am even “really” doing under the hood.

I have written Django Webapps and don’t really know how a web server works. I have used Kubernetes without even knowing what the architecture profoundly does. I have rolled out Spark clusters to improve performance but, besides the raw theory, I have no clue why the way it improves things really works on a down to compiled “RDD code” level.

Don’t get me wrong; with all of that I of course know what the theory behind it is. But I feel like my theory ends really quickly at the scope of the tool I am using. That my theoretical knowledge is limited to the knowledge about how a tool itself works, but not how it really runs or interacts with everything else.

Also I realized when switching over between programming languages that I fundamentally have no clue: I don’t know how compilers, linkers, registry, garbage collection, etc works, sometimes not even what it really is.

Overall I studied mathematics for quite a while and I for sure know my DS tools. But between me and my little CPU (well, more like a server rack but whatever) running all this jobs for me is a huge gap of cluelessness.

Makes me feel quite bad realizing this over the past few weeks.
So i would like to ask maybe the people here coming from CS or Engineering or something: any ideas where I should start to “catch up”?
I was thinking about getting a book about ARM architecture, learning a bit assembly, maybe refreshing my FORTRAN basics, write a very little binary compiler in C, and maybe play together a little Webserver and even a small web framework in Julia.

If doing research I will probably write algorithms as part of it. And I think I can’t write an efficient or proper algorithm without knowing what I am even doing here.

That would be my ideas for a lot of small projects over the course of this year or maybe even next year to get myself down to the concepts.

I would highly appreciate every link/keyword/etc or whatever you could get me as to where I should start or what you believe would be important.

Also, i would be happy to hear about your opinion: do you think I am too hard to myself for feeling bad for not knowing all of this? Or do you maybe even believe we don’t really need that foundation for DS?

datascience,"Recently I learned about ""peer group benchmarking"" from someone at another company in the context of converting a continuous score (model output \~ probability) into a binary decision (e.g. accept or decline). The idea as she explained is to make a decision off of a continuous score not solely based on a fixed threshold but rather based on the score of its peers within a sliding time window.

I might be completely wrong but one example I can think of is this. Let's imagine we are building a fraud detection classifier and assume that from cross validation we decided if the outputted probability is greater than 0.8 we reject the transaction. That is of course assuming the real world data will have similar distribution to our training set. Now, let's say due to pandemic the behavior has changed rapidly and unexpectedly in a way that our model generally produces 0.1 higher probabilities; this change in distribution might be different in different groups. if we still decline based on 0.8 threshold we may end up declining a lot of transactions. The peer group benchmarking comes into play here. if we can see that a certain transaction now has a 0.85  score but at the same time it is still well below its peers in a group, we may not decline it even though it is breaching our hard threshold of 0.8.

My new job gave me a $2500 laptop+accessories budget. Wondering what laptops you all like for data science?

It’s a consulting role, so I’ll be working with different client data and can safely assume it will be mostly stored in external or cloud databases. My sense is that mostly the work will be experimental design/analysis with some ML tasks NLP, image processing, though not sure about the specifics of what those tasks might be).

I was looking at the new MacBook Air with M1 chip because it’s 1) super light, great for me since I’ll be traveling a fair amount post-pandemic 2) relatively inexpensive compared to other Apple laptops, which means budget leftover for mouse or monitor for home office 3) apparently designed for ML??? 

But I’ve done some reading and it seems a lot of standard “data science” tools (numpy, pytorch, RStudio) aren’t compatible with the M1 chip. Is that true? So, I’m wondering what you all would recommend instead. 

I have a strong preference for Macs since I’m used to them, but could be convinced to switch. I used a 2016 MacBook Pro with touch bar in my last role and liked it a lot, but wish I could work with something just a little lighter.

I am trying to get a data science certificate to learn skills. I am currently an undergraduate majoring in unrelated fields. After the program, I might do freelance work if it fits into my schedule. I have no plans for data science to be my career, but think this is a valuable skillset to have. I have a lot of experience with R and really enjoy it, so I was considering [this program](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) from Johns Hopkins on Coursera. Alternatively, I am looking at [Google's new data analytics certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

My current quandary is that I really enjoy R and love statistics (the focus on the Hopkins program) but also think learning the other programs that Google's program teaches will be valuable.

Thank you in advance!",Thoughts on Data Science Certificate Options,1617392928
datascience,"In the past, all the work I have done has involved ""small data"". What I mean by that, the data I have used to perform statistical modelling and machine learning models - this data was ""carved out"" from a larger data source using SQL, and is able to fit into a very large excel  document (multiple spreadsheets). From here, I use R studio to import all these spreadsheets into R and ""concatenate"" the spreadsheets together (i.e. stack them on top of each other). So in the end, the final dataset I am using for my analysis is about 30 columns and 500,000 rows. From here, the analysis can take some time - but I usually put some coffee on and step away from the computer (a ""family laptop"" from Costco, no GPU) while the numbers crunch.

However, I am starting to realize that this approach will become less efficient and eventually stop working for larger data sources. I am aware that there is a whole world out there that is dedicated to dealing with and solving these problems - a world that I am not very familiar with. This world uses words like : hadoop, spark, aws, the cloud, parallelizing, apache, containerize, chunkize, etc.

As I see it, I feel that the problem can be viewed from different prespectives:

1) Performing machine learning and statistical analysis on large data might not be possible because of limitations in the individual computer you are using : this means, these procedures on this large data might not work on my computer - but it might work on my friend's (more powerful) computer who lives down the street

2)  Performing machine learning and statistical analysis on large data might not be possible because of limitations in the software (e.g. python, R) you are using : I am not very knowledgeable about what happens behind the curtains of the software, but my understanding is that software you are using (regardless of how powerful your computer is) might have certain limitations related to ""memory and ram"".

3) Both 1) and 2)

With this being said, I want to start exploring different ways to address these limitations. Based on my limited understanding of these topics, I think there are two main ways to address these limitations:

1) With money : Apparently you (or your company) can buy ""cloud services"" such as AWS, which will allow you to perform machine learning/statistical analysis on large data using ""remote servers"". I was told that this does not require a lot of knowledge or extra work - after purchasing these services, only a slight amount of extra code is required, and then you can effectively perform machine learning algorithms on big data.

2) with less money: this is where my understanding stops - apparently tools like ""hadoop"" can divide the computing costs between several computers and reduce the required time, or there is something called ""chunkize"" which allows you to sequentially feed your data into the algorithm without maxing out your computer.

How can I learn more about this? Suppose I have the same dataset with 30 columns, but this time there are 100 million rows. I want to use the random forest algorithm for a binary classification task.

How have people on r/datascience approached this kind of problem in the past?

It was meant to be a message to uplift all of us into better career development. 

But when I wrote that my first job as a Data Scientist was making $150k a year and that we can easily make $200k with upgraded skills, experience and right negotiation, people here laughed at me -- said that I was trolling and that kind of salary was insane. I told them this is the average in the Bay Area, but they said that even seniors don't make this kind of salary. 

Well 2 years later, I have just secured a $200k salary, $170k in base and $30 in yearly bonus (not including RSU). This is for a Data Scientist in ML role at a company in SF. I eventually settled for another company with far less salary but far better stock potential. But still. 

Given that I proved my initial point, I want to say few additional points of affirmation. 

1) Don't undersell yourself. Know your value and worth and stick to it with confidence even in this terrible economy. 

2) If you can impress the hiring manager and the senior management during interviews, they're more than happy to work with your professed worth (if not in salary, then in bonus, stocks, etc.). Otherwise, they will lowball you. 

3) Know how to play the political game during interview cycle. Master the negotiation tactics. Know how to bluff.

Have you ever thought that it'd be useful to train a model on historical weather data for some chunk of the world, but didn't want to deal with grungy data wrangling on a massive dataset to get it into a convenient format? 

Have you ever just been curious what the average temperature of Egypt in 1985 was?

Well, a friend and I made a webpage that lets you filter the 28 gig NOAA Global Summary of the Day weather dataset down to a small fraction of that, and download just the part you care about, as a csv, here:
https://gourdian.net/g/eric/noaa_gsod.global_summary_of_day

Table preview on the left, geographic and time filters and download button on the right. Delivers it as a single, clean csv, which should be easy to import into Pandas, R, a database, or whatever else you like to use to work on tabular data. CSV works with everything!

A bit about our goals and what we're trying to build:

* Filter (optional), click the button, CSV arrives on your hard drive
* Downloads are always a single CSV, no bundles with weird directory structures, no other formats
* CSVs are indexed and filterable by a few column types (lat/long and date/time at the moment), so you can download just the parts you want
* Open licensed datasets are free to download
* No signup required for downloading open datasets
* Search within and across datasets

Basically, our focus is on building something very simple - it won't be as powerful at fine-grained querying as something like BigQuery, but it should be easier to get going with.
