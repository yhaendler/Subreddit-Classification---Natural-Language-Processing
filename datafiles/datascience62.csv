datascience,"Hey, 

So I'm a fresher to datascience and lately I've been catching up on principal component analysis (PCA) and the math behind it. For anyone who is well versed in Linear Algebra, i have a question that's been itching in me. Now i know PCA is used to increase the Signal to Ratio, basically the information fed into our data. But the way to do so is little unclear. 

Firstly I went through the link [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mathematics-behind-principal-component-analysis-fff2d7f4b643) to understand what was happening. As a beginner in Linear Algebra, I understand what eigenvectors and eigenvalues are. Let me try to define it below, please let me know if I'm thinking straight:

&gt;Eigenvector is one, who when undergoing a Linear transformation through a matrix A will not change its orientation but only will be scaled by the eigenvalue. 

So in this aspect I was checking PCA, when it was mentioned we try to find the eighen vectors for Linear transformation given by the Covariance Matrix. Now this is where I have a hard time understanding the concept. Why are we seeing Covariance Matrix as a linear transformation, how does finding a vector that does not change its orientation and finding the eigenvalue help us here?

What are we trying to achieve by doing that? And is there any benefits in learning this particular mathematical concept? Or is it better to just leave it as it be and mug the concept?

I'd love some help as I'm unaware who to raise this question to. Hopefully I could find some help here. 

If its the wrong place to raise, please guide me as to where I can do so?

datascience,"Hello everyone, I'm Julian, I have a PhD in physics and I started learning DS about 6 months ago. I'm not a native english speaker (sorry for any mistake). I'm now in a postdoc position for 1.5 more years, but I KNOW that I will quit doing research when this position finishes and I will migrate exclusively to Data Science.  I am a specialist in Sustainable Energy Planning, and I love the topic, so it will be my goal to apply DS to that area of expertise (not necessarily, but would be amazing).

The things is, I have a whole year from now to continue specializing in DS, which is great, and I would love to read your opinion on what I should focus.

So far, I finished the following courses/specializations:

* Machine Learning (Coursera, Andrew NG).
* Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera, [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai)).
* Python for everybody Specialization (Coursera, U. Michigan).
* Applied DS with Python Specialization (Coursera, U. Michigan).

So I have a good theoretical understanding of the algorithms and why they work (mostly).

Projects:

* I applied a K-means algorithm to help a collegue distribute power bioplants across the area of our State, optimizing transport costs (Weiszfeld) and it works pretty well (it is one of the simplest algorithms out there anyway).
* I'm about to get a huge database of energy consumption (lots of variables) and climate variables from a town nearby. I will have some fun with that.

Next steps:

* I'm about to specialize a little more on SQL.
* I'm planning to do the Tensor Flow Specialization of Coursera.
* I will definetly re-learn some statistical concepts that I haven't used for a while.
* I should learn a lot more of Keras.

The doubts I have are:

* Should I learn R?
* Spark?
* Hadoop?
* Java?
* Scala?
* Tableau?
* AWS?
* Azure?
* Should I learn a lot more of Linux? I don't feel very comfortable working on scripts. Simply because I never had the neccesity to do so at large scale.

Of course, I will develop some personal projects, such as the mentioned above, but if you had to choose, what kind of projects would you focus on during this year?

My data basically looks like this: 

&amp;#x200B;

**Transactions**

&amp;#x200B;

|customer\_id|store|spend|date|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|xyz456|KFC|$20|02/02/2020|
|abc23|McDonalds|$50|01/01/2020|

|customer\_id|address|age|gender|other\_demographics|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|xyz456|12 Main Street|23|M|estimated wealth info etc.|
|abc23|15 Other Street|34|F|census info etc.|

&amp;#x200B;

And I've found the following packages that suit data like this:

&amp;#x200B;

**Lifetimes**

Churn analysis, predict number of purchases, predict customer lifetime value. The number of purchases and lifetime value aren't very accurate in my tests. Churn analysis is pretty good and extremely lightweight and simple. 

[https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes)

&amp;#x200B;

**ML Extend**

I've used it for Association Rule mining. It's used to find shopping patterns i.e. eggs are often bought with flour and milk. 

I've re-jigged it to find common demographic patterns in relation to stores. e.g. McDonalds customers are often 24 year old males. 

[http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Facebook Prophet**

Time Series forecasting. 

Not really impressed with time series in general. I can usually just draw an upwards trending line on the chart with crayon and get the same result. Although I've never really studied them in great detail. Just playing along with the documentation. 

[https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick\_start.html#python-api](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api)

&amp;#x200B;

**RFM Modeling**

Segment your customers based on how much they spend, how often and how recently. Useful for finding your ""champion"" customers, or people who may be slipping away into churning and need attention.

[https://github.com/zark-stark12/crm-rfm-modeling](https://github.com/zark-stark12/crm-rfm-modeling)

&amp;#x200B;

**Implicit**

Recommender system. Seems to work well. Quite good at finding similar stores / products. e.g. give it deliveroo and it will spit out other take away fast food companies and .. Netflix? Pizza and movie night maybe? Some interesting results.

datascience,"I have been working on a side project and I realize I have this big gap in my knowledge. I'm trying to set up a process that scrapes a website once a week, stores the data in a database. I will then use the scraped data to develop a model and ultimately build a little web app that makes predictions. 

I have already made the web scraper, I have built a Flask API before, and I know how to do the modeling. What I don't understand is how to set up the database to be persistent and hosted? I have the scraper working and writing to a postgres database locally, but I am struggling to figure out how to move this local process to a hosted environment. 

I would ideally like to use AWS to get experience using AWS. I am not working with very much data (thousands of observations) and I am not opposed to paying a small amount monthly for the services.

I have researched AWS S3 and I understand that this is basic storage. But I dump a postgres database there I can't actually connect to it can I?

I know that AWS has a RDS service, is this what people normally use? I basically just want to be able to pull data and write to a database hosted online somewhere rather than storing everything locally. All the tutorials I read always gloss over this step. Either the data isn't suppose to be persistent or they just ignore this part and describe the API building and deployment.

datascience,"Version 1.5.2 seems to have come a long way from a year back when I first used Julia in a class. 

I just looked into DataFramesMeta and it pretty much has whatever I need from the tidyverse along with DataFrames for groupby and combine(groupby(()) 

The packages I use mainly have been 
GLM, MixedModels (although for GLMMs I use R), DataFrames, DataFramesMeta, RCall, Distributions, StatsBase/Statistics, MultivariateStats, Lasso/glmnet, Plots (also usually call ggplot2), Clustering, DecisionTrees. In terms of statistical libraries Julia may be ahead of Python except for probably GAMs (Python has PyGAM) which you have to call out to R mgcv for. 

Then there is parallel computing which is actually pretty easy to use with Distributed, SharedArrays, and ParallelDataTransfer. 

DataFrames with DataFramesMeta seem to work in an intuitive manner unlike Pandas, more directly similar to dplyr (and there is an equivalence chart on the github docs). The macros @where, @select, @transform pretty much work like dplyr does (but no piping) however you can use the @linq macro syntax to do the piping.

Also using the “.” with a function like f.() in order to vectorize it I really like, and if you do end up having to use a loop the speed penalties are not as bad. 

Modules have also been nice for projects to keep functions nicely organized in your own library.

Seems to cover most everyday things I do. And functional programming has been a lot easier for me than the OOP and def __init__() and self() and super() crap that Python has. 

I have really been liking the structs concept and it kind of addresses a weakness with R in how the S3/S4 system can be hard to learn. Code is way cleaner and using structs really helps abstraction, which is useful when its been a while since you looked at something and forgot the details.

Its also very very easy to use RCall to get that one stats method from R you need, and this integration is better than rpy2, reticulate etc. It pretty much works out of the box.

I guess the main barrier is going to be production related. Its possible to do it but I don’t think most DE people would know it.",Is Julia viable for DS now?,1604429911

Full disclosure I have zero background in programming or data science. I work in public policy and have a degree in economics and masters in public administration. I wanted to build up data science skills because I think there can be significant opportunities to improve public policy analysis through data science. I wanted a resource that could help me build a foundation in python and R and so I eventually just opted for DataQuest after seeing some reviews on here.

Overall I got to say I love it, the exercises build on each other really well and everything gets wrapped up with a project that uses all the skills you learned. What I love most though is the newsletter that comes out regularly and the community forum. The newsletter always provides great articles and sometimes data or projects people in the community have worked on. Whenever I had a question, you can easily and automatically post to the forum and the answers I received were always fast and phenomenal. Doing the courses, reading the newsletter, and participating in the forum really helps you to feel like you are being educated and not just doing exercises.

datascience," I am thinking of training a model to automatically extract information from more or less structured documents like invoices.

Here are the main challenges regarding this task:

1. In fact, even though invoices are often called ""structured"" documents, there is a lot of variance in their layouts depending on the field, company, and other factors, which makes it almost impossible to achieve great results with pattern matching.
2. When relying on text, the most straightforward solution to get textual information from documents is using an OCR engine like Tesseract or EasyOCR (or, probably, commercial solutions from Google, Amazon, Microsoft). Unfortunately, more often than not, outputs from OCR libraries are rather dirty, which can be explained by the quality of scans.
3. Some fields can appear in a document multiple times. This is especially true for line items
4. Some values might belong to several classes (entities) at the same time. For example, extracting addresses, company names is definitely not a one-to-one mapping in that several companies are mentioned with the corresponding addresses and other types of information.

That said, what could you recommend as a possible approach to this problem? I understand that given (1)-(4) there is no way I should expect a perfect solution, but at least something that would at least make sense to try.

My current thoughts:

* This problem has a lot of similarity with traditional NER-like tasks, but those are most often trained on sentenced where there's a lot of semantical value and not just key/value pairs.
* I am almost 100% certain that without some rules, even some hardcoded ones, it will be extremely difficult to get something useful. One such idea is to use a pre-trained NER model, extract standard entities like MONEY, DATE, COMPANY, etc, and then just look in the neighborhood of these entities (in terms of coordinates, I mean) to check whether phrases like Total amount  
or Invoice date  
are nearby.
* Probably, it makes sense to use both bounding boxes and text values for labeling and further model building. On the other hand, it would be quite challenging to do that labeling because some entities might change their location from document to document, span over several lines, etc.

What should I read/try to have a better understanding of how to approach this problem?

Thanks in advance!",How do I approach this document extraction problem?,1604384600
