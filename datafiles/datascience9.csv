I'm in a bit of a pickle. I am currently a fourth year student at a top Canadian university (McGill University) majoring in computer science. Over the last year, I have however realized that being a software developer is just not what I want to do. I love coding, and have had two internships as a dev, but much prefer ML/data analysis due to the field's versatility in a variety of fields (quantitative social sciences, biological data analysis, heck even data science applied to astronomy).

My question is the following: would extending my studies ever-so-slightly (1 year part-time - approximately 12-15 credits) to fulfill a statistics minor be worth it (courses would be in stochastic processes, time series, and probably databases to fill in a few CS holes)? I was initially planning on going for a master's to deepen my knowledge of the field but I just can't justify the financial and applications hassle (already took courses in ML, bioinformatics, NLP and Vision) for a program that seems redundant.

For context: I took out loans to pay for college but have already been paying them off with internship savings. I'm currently \~20k CAD in the debt hole, and would be around the same upon graduation in a year (have an internship lined up and would pick up a part-time job upon starting next year).

datascience,"Hi All,

I've been struggling with a decision I recently made, in terms having some regret that has been bothering me.

**Background:** Last summer I was supposed to be at a fairly famous three letter agency for an internship. Unfortunately for this internship I needed a very intensive security clearance and it did not finish in time for the internship. I was given the option to continue the clearance for a internship during the year, which I accepted.

After not hearing literally anything, despite my attempts to contact someone, I decided to start my job search again as I graduate this year. I was able to get a spring internship at another federal agency (no security clearance required) and a job offer (I accepted) for a data science fellowship (3 year term) after I graduate with a very nice compensation package that works in the defense sector.

**What happened:** The day my new internship started I get a call from the previous agency that my clearance had gone through and asked when I could start. I explained that I was at another federal agency at the time and they said they would contact me about other options. I then get an email that I'm on their for-hire-list and I start getting job offers from this agency that for the past year and a half I've been thinking about.

Unfortunately, none of the positions were for a data scientist and the compensation was over 25k less than my fellowship so I turned it down.

**Conflicted:** I would love to work at the agency, but I just don't think the entry level position they would give me would help me grow in my career. I have student loans and the higher salary is also super compelling to me. I just keep regretting turning down an opportunity that for so long I wanted/still want?

datascience,"Im a bit of an ML newbie so I’m going through and trying to see if I can take different topics and distill them into super simple explanations (I’ve always thought you don’t know something until you can teach it). So assuming someone has no prior ML or stats exposure, how would you explain regression to them (linear and logistic).

As far as simple linear regression. I would say at that at its core, it is an attempt to determine how much the change in one quantity affects the change in another based on as many examples as you can. For example, if we want to see how the height and weight of a person are related. We would try and get the heights and weights of as many people as we can to see how one tends to vary with the other. That way, when we encounter someone new, we could try and predict one quantity once we have the other. 

Or for dimensionality reduction, I was thinking of TV/movies which are 2D replications of 3D objects but there’s not much loss of information by getting rid of the third dimension (as a super simple intro to PCA, feature engineering, etc)

Most of the models I have come across in my research (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) limit you to one row of input and binary/categorical values:

I want to take historical monthly customer usage data to identify either when that customer will churn or the probability of a customer churning within x months. I have structured my data in a way that i think would work for this if I could identify the right model to use.

Data Columns  
customer-id - unique customer id  
year_month - month in which the data was recorded  
orders-placed - total orders processed in the month  
units_ordered - total amount of units in all orders that month  
client_customers - total customers our client sells to  
age_in_months - account age of client in months from first sign up  
churned - has this customer cancelled their account in a given month  
 
In the link below you can see an example of two customers ordered by the year_month descending. The top customer churned after 8 months and the bottom customer has an active subscription as of this month. With this type of data structure I would like to create at risk thresholds based on declines in orders_placed, units_ordered, and client_customers for all active customers to identify future churn.

Anyway, that probably won't happen, so I am also really interested in applying data science to areas in my work (computational bio, to joining the production/operation efficiency team). Most of my projects at work have involved predictive models using ANN, etc to improve X or Y, so I really see myself advancing with this degree.

ok, so I'm kinda freaking out, not gonna lie. I work the same schedule that I think most nurses do, so 3 days on 4 days off, 4 days on, 3 days off. 13hr days. I can't really study or do HW on the days I work. It's pretty much just work, eat, sleep, repeat. Also, my company provides yearly tuition reimbursement, which is like two classes of the program (which is awesome). While my company did get bought out by a company that offers 100% tuition reimbursement, those benefits don't kick in until next year.Â 

With my schedule, if I take one class a quarter, it will take me about 4 years to graduate, which I am not even sure is allowed with master's programs. I don't want to rush, or over-stress myself, but I do have to complete this degree one day. Some of the classes can be swapped out for internships, or work-approved projects.

I had the option of taking placement exams to test out of a Python programming class, and two mathematics classes...but it's been three years since I took a Calc3/Diff. Eq. exam.

 👇🏻 Here's a full video with all the new features in Pandas 1.0.0 👇🏻 

 ✅ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqZunPIIsqU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqZunPIIsqU) 

Although at first sight this latest version is not much different for the user than the previous release starting with a 0: 0.25.3, there are plenty of enhanced features that boost performance and lay a better foundation in the long run. They represent 1.0.0 as a stable version of pandas with a strengthened API, which has also been cleaned of many prior version deprecations. Here are the most notable improvements that come with 1.0.0. 

**One:** 

\- The dedicated string and Boolean data types 

These features are still “experimental”, which means that further improvements are expected to happen in the near future. So, as of yet, pandas will not automatically assign “string” or “bool” to your data.   

**Two.** The select data types method is much quicker now! It relies on vectorization instead of iterating over a loop. So, you can run select data types, string to pull all string values, or select data types, “bool” to retrieve the Boolean data from a DataFrame, provided that you have set them as such beforehand.  

**Three.** We now can enjoy the pandas, NA scalar that denotes missing values. Using pandas, NA is a new concept in the scientific ecosystem of Python, and its goal is to provide an indicator for missing values that can be used consistently and successfully across data types.  

**Four.** A method that will convert the data types of columns containing such null values has been introduced – convert data types. 

**Five.** The well-known info has been improved. It is much more readable and this does help you to explore your data in a quicker and more efficient way.  

**Six.** Now we also have the “to markdown”  – this new method allows you to display a Series or DataFrame object as a markdown table.
