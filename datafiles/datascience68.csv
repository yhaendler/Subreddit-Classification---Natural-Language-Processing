datascience,"Hello!

I'm currently working as Junior Data Scientist in the headquarters of a big multinational company for almost 3 years. It is my first job since I finished my masters in Computer Science, working on a project related to Data Visualisation and Machine Learning.

During the first 2,5 years, I asked a lot my manager to join the projects related to Machine Learning, but ended up working a lot building dashboards - nothing against it, but the projects were basically migrating an Excel dashboard to a BI one, super boring. Apart from that, I have worked on a project which I needed to aggregate billions of records of a telemetry table to support stakeholders to analyse consumer usage of the appliances produced by their units - basically a Data Engineer/Software Engineer project.

However, what I and many colleagues (including my manager) noticed that I have a big talent for communications. I'm able to communicate pretty well with stakeholders, understand their requirements and translate the findings into non-technical language. Now my current work is basically connect with stakeholders, understand their problems related to data, suggest solutions and tests with proof of concepts and create roadmaps for future DS projects with my team. I enjoy very much what I'm doing now and would prefer that way more that sitting for hours developing models or solutions, with minimal communication with the stakeholders, like my colleagues Data Scientists are doing in my team.

Now I'm thinking about leaving my position of Data Scientist and have another role in which I would focus more on pre-deliverable phase of the projects. However, negotiations with my manager are not going so well as I'm struggling a bit to define my role: Is it Data Analyst, Business Analyst,...? Then what is the implications of moving out from Data Scientist position? Does it make sense to do this transition? My manager suggested that I could take a Project Manager position, but I don't feel that my profile fits with this role as I don't wanna leave entirely the development side. I would like to be this bridge between front and back office, which I can communicate with stakeholders about the problems, but still discuss about solutions in a technical way with my colleagues in my team.

Hope I'm not being so fuzzy in my text, but I can do my best to clarify any questions on comments.",Advice about moving out from Data Scientist position,1607121367

I need a laptop for my data science degree. I know I don't need a high spec laptop since I'll mostly be working on remote servers, but I'd still like a half decent one for playing around with programming offline.

I've done a lot of research and based on my personal preferences I've narrowed it down to these two. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated (I'm also open to other suggestions).

I am following this tutorial over here: [https://gist.github.com/thomasmooon/6eb87964ea663f4a7441cc2b2b730bd4](https://gist.github.com/thomasmooon/6eb87964ea663f4a7441cc2b2b730bd4)

Everything runs perfectly on my personal computer - however, on my work computer I am unable to download the ""pec"" library. This means, I can not plot the ROC. I do however have libraries such as ""caret"", ""dplyr"", ""ggplot2"". I was thinking that it might be possible to plot the ROC using other libraries in R such as base R graphics and ggplot2.

This start up has an intense five-month training program at the beginning of the job, where I would be taught all the AI and ML I'll need, and of course after I work on projects I'll gain experience, so even though it is a job it also presents a huge learning opportunity maybe even better than the one of the masters. 

I want to have a career in DS and there are two choices: either take the job, work there for a couple of years and then pursue my masters. Or do my masters next winter semester as planned and look for a job in Germany only after being done with the master. Which one do you suggest? 

Some additional information:
-The job is remote so I would be pretty much staying at my parent's house if I take the offer. And I would begin the training program in March 
-I have various master options because some of the colleges in Germany have pretty strict requisites that don't allow people to change career paths just like that. And even though I studied an engineering I didn't formally take the DS classes that are requisites for getting into the masters. In this sense, maybe the job experience in the field can help me get a spot easier later but is not sure because germans love rules. In any case, I have found 2 masters in which I can get in without problem 
-I know Python but I wouldn't say I'm an expert. Asides from the Andrew Ng's course on ML I don't know anything else about DS
-I want to live in another country 
-I have to take a loan in order to do my masters in Germany. I ran some numbers and if I save 70% of the salary I'd have in the start up during two years, I can reduce the loan by 33%

Not gonna lie, I feel like I’m holding myself back a lot when it comes to applying as I don’t feel like my resume or portfolio is good enough. I have a 3.45 GPA with a 3.8 major GPA if that matters. 
My question is is it possible to secure a data science internship as an undergrad?

I also would appreciate any advice on the application process like how I can get in touch with recruiters, make my resume stand out as an undergrad so that it goes past screening, what kind of projects seem like a good idea. 

Current projects I have consist of some Regression(Linear,Logistic), Clustering projects. Also got a few Deep Learning projects with Binary Classification (mostly Kaggle competition data). For the Regression and Clustering projects, I mostly scraped data myself or asked some of my friends for relevant data. 

Also would appreciate if you described how you tackled the internship search, what projects you did, academic stats if you are comfortable, and company you interned at (again if you are comfortable). I think a lot of us need some inspiration or a kick in the butt in this internship hunt season. Appreciate any feedback, good or harsh.",Internships as an undergrad?,1607011997

They throw us dirty ass data sets which were never vetted by data engineers, just developers tossing whatever they wanted in the databases and tracking fuck all. 

Then they expect the team to do “data science-y stuff” in 2-3 days. 

They don’t understand that data scientists requires a whole fucking lot of time to talk with stakeholders, understanding what they want, understanding what’s available, and then working with data engineers to see if any of this is already available but not stored properly (clean ups etc). 

Then comes the understanding of the relations between data sets within the database, then comes the math hypothesis and then comes the experimentation. 

Visuals are a by product of that experimentation.  Coding comes into play when we construct our experiments, and when we visualise them (SQL to Tableau). 

But my fucking god. 2-3 days is fucking ridiculous. Most companies think data science teams are just an extension of the engineering arm that validates their stupid business decisions to make numbers go brrrr.

As a background, I’m 30, have a bachelors degree in business and finance, experience in operations management and some analytics experience. I also worked on two international sustainability projects at school (a consulting project and a business plan project).

The dream is to work in sustainability, ideally as a consultant, but financial stability concerns me a lot, so my idea was to break into data science and focus on sustainability issues. 

Just got accepted into a MSc data analytics program but I’m debating whether I should also try my luck applying to the MSc applied economics (environmental) and MSc sustainability programs. 

I reeeeally don’t want to be stuck working a job at something I hate, that’s why I’m not 100% sure whether the data analytics program could help me achieve my dreams. 

I’m not sure if pursuing a degree in the field of sustainability would be a sound idea, especially now because of covid, I don’t know if it’ll make jobs in sustainability even scarcer. 

However, if I pursue the degree in analytics, I’m also thinking of taking a certification course in corporate sustainability by either Cambridge or NYU stern. 

Is anybody here familiar with those certification programs or could recommend something that’ll help me work in corporate sustainability? Or is this even a good idea at all?

datascience,"Hi everyone and goodafternoon,

I feel like this topic has been talked before but Im in the midst of what is my next step.
A little background for you guys. This way you can understand the place im at. I was a math mayor and in my senior year I transfered to computer science since I like programming. So basically I extended my time at uni 2 more years and have only the computer science courses left. I already have a little more than a year worth of programming in C++ and Python. Recently took this semester Statistical Data Analysis with Python and Jupyter Lab. Next semester I will be taking Data Mining and Machine Learning. Probably will use Keras and Tensorflow for deep learning, and UCI or Kaggle for Machine Learning. Im psyched to learn about it. But have some doubts and concerns.

My mayor concerns is that although I know the basics/foundations, I still don’t have an internship and my gpa is almost 3.0(2.97) which is a mayor concern for me. It will be harder for me to get a job after graduation. I started to look at internship to gain expirience but I dont have much projects in my belt, I only have my assignments from my class to show. Most of the internships require a 3.0 or more and I need something to stand out and get that expirience prior to graduation.

Here is where I need you guys help to mentor me and advice me in what is the best next step I can take. For this Christmas I was thinking to get a course in EDX/Coursera/Udacity to learn more about data science as a speciality. They offer this programs in which in the end you have to do a capstone and post it on github which can help a lot to have opportunities. Im leaning towards it since I have all this christmas break to learn. There are courses varying from Harvard, MIT, John Hopkins, IBM so much to pick but I don’t know which. Im leaning to pick a course that offers capstone so this way I can share it on linkedin and put it on resume and CV.

This brings me to the last concern. Are those certificates worth it? Will me having a certificate that I took the courses raise value and/or probability to get an internship and eventually a job? The way I see it is that projects can help you get an internship and internship helps you get a job. As of right now I want to have projects on me to get an internship(or I think this is the best way) to gain valuable expirience. I think/feel that by having a certificate with projects can help me get an internship and progress into my professional life. Am I wrong? Will it be worth it? 

If you took the time to read this I want to thank you for your time and will be deeply greateful for your help provided. Willingly open to discuss and ask more questions about this.

Almost two months ago, I signed a contract to do bioinformatics consulting work for a very small company (essentially just one scientist with an LLC and an NIH grant).  She needed basic things like data fetching, data cleaning, etc., of HBV genomes.  She was in a bind, so I agreed to work quickly and I settled for $60/hr.  Way too low, I know.  But this was my first consulting experience and I weighed the experience more than the money earned.  Anyways...we agreed to terms and I did 30 hours of work for her.  (I actually did more like 45 hours of work, but I only billed 30 hrs because the rest was research on HBV genomic data.   I sent the invoice on Oct. 30th.  She was upset that it was ""more hours than what she expected"" - although two weeks before I told her how many hours I had worked and explained that in addition to fetching and cleaning the data I was writing scripts to automate it for the future.  She said she understood it would be more time-intensive in the beginning and I should keep going.  Hence, 30 hrs instead of the 10 hrs which was my initial commitment.  Note: that was NOT my estimate of how much time it would take, it was the max hours I was comfortable committing to per week with my full-time job.  When she expressed disapproval of the number of hours, I stood firm and explained what I did with the time.  I reminded her that these 6 repetitive processes have now been automated, so they will be very fast.  One thing I did is I wrote up documentation for her to explain what I did, the exact parameters I used to clean data, my summary of the data quality, and the location of all the files in the AWS cloud.  No one in the past did this for her, and she literally has no idea where any of the data is located that these people she hired obtained and produced.  So we were in communication about the number of hours, and also $60/hr is really low for a bioinformatics consultant anyway. I can provide details about everything I did here if people want to judge whether it's reasonable.

I've emailed her twice in the last month for ""updates"" and it appears she has ghosted me.  I am willing to eat this $1,800 and chalk it up to a learning experience.  I have also removed all the work I did from the cloud, so unless they preemptively copied it elsewhere then they got essentially nothing from me (except for work summaries sent via email, but no data described therein).  The thing is, I still wasted my time and it was a lot of aggravation.  So how do I prevent this in the future?  I signed the contract but she never mailed me back a copy of it signed by her.   The contract is valid in the state of Virginia, but I don't live there.

I would really appreciate thoughtful advice and/or constructive criticism.  I've gotten more wonderful advice from considerate people in this subreddit than any other...I hope it continues. Thanks!",Ghosted by consulting client...how to prevent this in the future?,1606931379
