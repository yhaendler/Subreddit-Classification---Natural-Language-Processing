Anyway I needed to model volatility for a project, and Google search said GARCH was the way to go. So I calculated the annual volatility of my series and chucked that series into a GARCH (1,1) model on python, only to be outputted really shitty results.

I found out now that the GARCH model on python requires the raw data, and not the volatility data.

Anyway my question is this. If I used an ARIMA process to model the volatility data that I made, would the modelling of volatility be better or worse than the GARCH model?",ARIMA vs GARCH,1593472097

datascience,"Hi everyone,

I'm pleased to announce the release of Ploomber 0.5. This version includes a feature we implemented thanks to valuable feedback provided by fellow data scientists.

In previous versions, Ploomber required you to write Python code to define your pipeline (Airflow-like) but we now have a much simpler alternative.

With the new Spec API you can list your tasks in a YAML file and Ploomber will use static analysis to define the DAG and execute it.

Our goal is to equip data scientists with a tool that allows them to develop pipelines collaboratively and iteratively. We believe the Spec API gets us a bit closer to that end.

More details in our blog post: [https://ploomber.io/posts/collaborative-ds/](https://ploomber.io/posts/collaborative-ds/)

datascience,"I’m considering possible recommenders for work. Our particular industry and product/service portfolio doesn’t really lend itself to collaborative filtering. Generally, our customers with invest in 1-2 products/services at a time and they are very tightly coupled. No need for an algorithm to see that. It’s more about the order in which they “purchase” and the time between those “purchases.” 

Anyway, there are a hunch of ways to do this, but some that I’ve already considered would likely need to be “retrained” over some interval; either when performance falls off or just at some prescheduled interval. But, how do the successful recommendations affect future training? Wouldn’t this kind of be like raising the weight of recommendations by powers compared to “organic” instances? 

Like, if the system recommends products A, B, C in that order often, and people succumb to the recommendation, then retraining will develop bias towards that ordered set. 

Would it be a best practice to track recommended “purchases” and not recommended and only train in the organic purchases? How do collaborative filtering techniques address this?",Recommender system in production learning from the results of its own recommendations; good or bad?,1593462479

I've been experimenting with several Matrix Factorization based methods, including Neural Collaborative Filtering, Deep Factorization Machines, LightFM, and Variational Autoencoders. None of these papers seem to address the issue of aggregating implicit data. They also do not discuss how to weight different types of user events (e.g. clicks vs purchase) when calculating a score. 

For now I've been using a confidence score approach (the conference score corresponds to the count of events) as outlined in this paper: [http://yifanhu.net/PUB/cf.pdf](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/cf.pdf). However this approach doesn't address incorporating other types of user events (other than clicks), nor does it address negative implicit feedback (e.g. a ton of impressions with zero clicks).

The one on the top is the original dataset and the one on the bottom is scaled.

I can see that the clusters overlap in 2D picture if they are plotted from the original dataset but not if plotted from processed dataset. In 3D picture the clusters are well separated even if the plotting is done from the original dataset. 

**First question:**  Why are the clusters overlapping in the original datasets plot but not in the processed dataset? I know that the clustering takes account all the different attributes so overlapping might happen in 2D but it seems weird that same attributes plotted in 2D look so different.

**Second question:**  My goal is to have clustering that represent how ""green"" the buildings are. (Based on their size, how much the building uses energy etc.) How can I test if my model does that when I don't have any labeled data?

I'm currently a rising fourth year in university and am a computational math major/stats minor. After changing my major a couple times, I recently became interested in data science and wanted to go down that career path. I wanted to work for a couple years after graduation, but after reading a bunch of reddit posts, I'm thinking that maybe now I should go to grad school. What do ya'll recommend? 

I currently have an internship as a data science intern at a fairly new company and am hoping that they will offer me a full time for after I graduate, but I'm not sure if they will or if I even wanna work for them. My coding skills right now are alright; I'm proficient in python and have been using that for most of my projects, but I barely know any R / SQL and my coding skills overall are just alright, so I'm not sure if I can handle the rigor of such a technical role (like data engineering/data science) post grad without strengthening some of those skills first. 

And, if I wanted to apply for another job post grad, I'm not sure what job I should apply for that would lead me down that career path of data science (given that my major is not CS). Would it be data engineering, data analytics, marketing analytics, or financial analytics??

Hi guys,

I  recently joined a company and I look after a central system. My system  integrates with many other systems to bring in data and host it in this  central system.

The big issue I  found is the way various teams are capturing the data in their specific  area and then struggling to deliver the data to my central system.

The  way they capture the data is through using excel forms or other  mechanisms that allow for data entry mistakes. Also, the processes to  push into my system is manual from their end.

I was hoping to ask on here if you can assist on what paid or free source software or even best practices to help develop:

1. A  quick, easy, and sufficient way for data capture to happen by the user  who collects the data. Should we look into form entries where it can  push into a database or other possibilities? What is the best way to do this?
2. How to monitor data capture and processes (monitoring to see if users have  for example submitted data or if they are late). If for example they have not submitted data for say this week, then we can send a automated   email to suggest they haven't.
3. What  processes should be used to push the data from one system to another?  Should this be via python or any other scripting language?",Data Processing from Different Teams to a Central Database,1593341806

datascience,"Hello!

Just posting because I want help getting better at pandas. Is the method I came up with a good approach, or is there a better way? 

I wrote [a blog post](https://brasier.me/pandas/2020/06/10/neeerd-pledge/#) about it, but I just wanted to check my method is the best one. Basically I want to find the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of an event. So if I have lots of different groups, and I want the most in a row of any `df.eval` query.

Here's the code, I'll explain how it works below.


    def get_max_consecutive(group):
        # thanks stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/a/59640568/5905582
        # this works for each player
        # first get all matches and compare with a shifted version to how many are the same in a row
        df_bool = group['criteria_match'] != group['criteria_match'].shift()
        # take the cumulative sum of the matches in a row to get the number of each
        df_cumsum = df_bool.cumsum()
        # then groupby the size of each group
        search_groups = group.groupby(df_cumsum)
    
        # the above will give us the size, but we also want the raw data out of each
        # so below we are getting the indexes from the original dataset so we can look them up later
    
        # what we want is the longest group where criteria_match == True
        # make a dictionary with the key the name, but store each length
        lengths = {n: len(g) for n,g in search_groups if g['criteria_match'].all() == True}
        try:
            # m is the maximum number of matches
            m = max(lengths.values())
        except ValueError:
            # if there are no matches, return 0 and not-a-number
            return pd.DataFrame({'maximum': [0], 'num_results':0, 'indexes':[np.nan]})
        # get a list of groups where the match is the players maximum value
        # includes if a player matches multiple times
        all_groups = [search_groups.get_group(key) for key,val in lengths.items()]
        max_groups_list = [search_groups.get_group(key) for key,val in lengths.items() if val == m]
        num_items = len(max_groups_list)
        return pd.DataFrame({'maximum': [m]*num_items, 
                             'num_results': [num_items]*num_items, 
                             'indexes': [g['index'].values for g in max_groups_list],
                            })
    
    def get_all_consecutive(criteria, data):
        # drop all rows where the values were after doesn't exist
        all_columns = list(data.columns.values)
        for c in all_columns:
            if c in criteria:
                data = data[data[c] != np.nan]
        # find all matches and set them to true, set non-matches to False
        data.loc[data.eval(criteria), 'criteria_match'] = True
        data['criteria_match'].fillna(False, inplace=True)
        # group by all the search item, and then actually do the check for each one.
        search_item = all_columns[1]
        results = data.groupby(search_item).apply(get_max_consecutive)
        return results
    
    def get_most_consecutive_individual(criteria, data=my_data.copy()):
        results = get_all_consecutive(criteria, data, sort_order)
        # get the maximum result
        max_value = results['maximum'].max()
        # get all matches to the maximum
        max_results = results[results['maximum'] == max_value]
        # get the matches out of the original dataset to get the innings
        result_data = data.reindex(np.concatenate(max_results.indexes.values))
        return max_value, result_data


Here's how it works. 

1. mark all matches `True` and `False` that meet the criteria
2. `groupby` each person, and for each person, call `get_max_consecutive`
3. `get_max_consecutve` gets the size of each group by again calling `groupby` on the `cumsum` of `matches != matches.shift()` 
4. Here's where I want help, I can use the `agg` functions to get maximum size, but I want to original data back, so what I'm doing is looking up the index where the `criteria_match` is `True`, and looping through this manually.
5. The reason for that in finding the group that is the longest, and then getting the index in the original dataset so it can be looked up later. `max_groups_list` stores the groups, and `'indexes': [g['index'].values for g in max_groups_list` returns the index
6. Get all `matches == max_value`
7. Get the original data by calling `data.reindex(np.concatenate(max_results.indexes.values))` where `data` is my original data

I'm new to learning `pandas` so I really don't know if my approach is the best one. Needless to say this took me a long time to figure out, but it works, so that's a win, I've just been thinking 'there must be a better way' but honestly I can't think of one. On a dataset which is ~100k lines, it takes 20s-1minute depend on how my computer is feeling to run. 

Returning the `DataFrame` with different sized elements is a bit annoying, I suppose I could make them all `pd.Series`, but anyway, I didn't.

I don't think I really understand working with `DataFrameGroupBy` objects really. I suspect the `transform` method might be what I'm after, but just looking to learn really!","Pandas - finding consecutive occurrences, please critique my approach",1593322563

I'm a grad student in data science, trying to decide what to study in my Fall semester.  I'm primarily interested in inference and experimental methods.
