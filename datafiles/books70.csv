books,"Hi /r/books!

tl;dr I built a reading app over quarantine after searching for a tool and coming across a post on reddit about how much people disliked goodreads.

I started reading a lot more when quarantine started. After finishing the books I had scattered around the house, I turned to friends and family for recommendations and to tap into their personal libraries.

Funnily enough, most people I spoke to were also reading more, but had a hard time recalling the titles to give a good recommendation. I started thinking how cool it would be if I could use an app that would let me see what my close connections were currently reading or had read.

I found goodreads pretty quickly. I loved that it had all the books that I purchased on amazon. But that's it. That's all I liked. Everything else just felt... bad. I don't want to rag on goodreads, but it wasn't the right tool.

I stumbled across this post on reddit shortly after where i discovered how many other people also dislike goodreads i read through the comments

and found a few common threads:

* Searching is a bad experience (for finding books and friends)
* Terrible interface
* Recommendations aren‚Äôt good
* Bulk editing is difficult
* No good tagging/labeling/grouping functionality
* Hard to find friends

I decided to see if I could find a tool that provided all the things on the list. I looked, but I couldn't find anything that fit the bill. 

I‚Äôm in the tech trade and also enjoy working on fun side projects like this. I decided to set my focus into this single project for the remainder of quarantine. I went from reading a bunch, to coding a bunch about reading üòù

I started story mapping the idea in June. I broke the proposed tool down into three separate chunks:

Track, Discover, Connect

To satisfy the track requirement I needed to be able to:

* search for a book and add it to my library
* move books on and off ‚Äúshelves‚Äù
* combine books into reading lists
* group books by genre, event, or any other way I wanted
* see basic book info
* add notes and quotes from books I'm reading
* Import my books from goodreads
* Export my library
* Buy books, preferably from local bookstores

For discover, I needed to be able to:

* Find and invite my friends to the app
* Browse my friends‚Äô reading lists and books
* Add books from my friends‚Äô libraries to my library
* Find books and reading lists from folks outside of my circle, like [Oprah](https://www.bukkuro.com/reading_lists/45)

And finally, for connect:

I wanted to be able to start book clubs with my family, friends, and co-workers.

I love book clubs. I love hearing other people's interpretation of the same book that I'm reading.

I find that I have better reading comprehension and recall from books I've read as part of a book club than books that I've read solo. Due to quarantine, my normal book clubs were disbanded. 

After doing a bit of research and reflecting back on my book clubbing experiences, I was able to story map it into this:

* What is the book club? (Name, general description, public or private)
* When is the book club? (Day, time, duration, meeting frequency)
* Who is in the book club? (Members)
* Where is the book club meeting? (Zoom)
* Why is the book club meeting? (Discuss topics related to the book)
* What book are we reading?

I also included challenges. I found the challenges were useful in incentivizing myself to read for a few minutes longer every day. Completing challenges and interacting with my library earns points towards leveling up the leaderboards. 

All that being said, with all the apps out there, I was surprised that there wasn‚Äôt a good goodreads alternative available on the internet. Does a tool composing the above (track, discover, connect) meet the needs of fellow book lovers? Are there other tools that the reading community uses that they love?

books,"Just finished reading. I was so lost for words when I got up to the last page. That epilogue was beautifully done. 

This is an incredibly complex book but I am so glad I read it. I mostly did for the thrilling plot points but I enjoyed the thought-provoking aspect as well. 

My own thoughts:

- I agree with a lot of people when they say Richard was an ‚Äòunreliable narrator‚Äô. He was stoned all the time, drinking and whatnot, and he must have been so paranoid having to hear every bit of information secondhand. Honestly I feel bad for him. I could sense his disappointment and wound when he said he had no other story to tell. It‚Äôs quite sad. 28 is still young and here I just felt the mental dead end he came to in his mind, as if his life was for nothing but this. 

- Charles was a wreck! Damn. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd imagine him being much more happier in the future. 

- Francis is my favourite character. He still had heart in my opinion. It broke my heart when he tried to kill himself in the epilogue. I truly hope he would be able the cope with all the events. 

- Henry being the ‚Äòring leader‚Äô is so powerful to me. Probably because I‚Äôve experienced it myself but I just understood the unnerving composure with which he held himself. Obviously he was not actually calm but he faked it quite well. 

I have some questions:

1. First of all, the twins: I kept wondering why Camilla kept allowing herself to sleep with Charles if she was uncomfortable? Is it because Charles was emotionally abusive so she couldn‚Äôt really escape from him?

2. I‚Äôm not the only one who wants Richard and Francis to get together right? I mean I felt like Richard loved Francis. In another time, maybe. 

3. How do you think they would all be coping in their older ages? (I‚Äôm especially curious about Charles lol)

books,"Has anyone come across this book yet? I found it about a month ago and finally had the time to read it. 

Firstly, I‚Äôll say that I‚Äôm not the biggest reader out there. Admittedly, I am very picky when it comes to books. In most cases, I read the first page or chapter and let that determine whether or not I want to continue or purchase the book. I‚Äôve read many epistolary novels, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever found a book that made me feel so emotionally attached so quickly. I won‚Äôt spoil *A Letter to the Message Man* seeing how it appears to be fairly new and unseen, but I never would have thought I‚Äôd find myself so invested in a novel quite possibly not meant for my age demographic (haven't been in high school in years). I‚Äôll break this up into small parts because there‚Äôs just so much I want to say about this hidden gem.

**The Cover Art**

Since it‚Äôs the first thing you see, I‚Äôll get it out the way first. The cover art for this novel is probably one of my absolute favorites on my shelf. I‚Äôll leave a picture of it [HERE](https://gyazo.com/7e0d74b69b7265b148c2817b830765f4) (not my picture). I‚Äôm also a sucker for creative on-theme book covers. 

**The Novel Format/Structure**

If you thought the book cover was unique, wait until you see how the novel itself is written. It‚Äôs written in multiple points of view of the 6 main characters. At first I was worried that this was going to hurt the novel due to the author having to write from the eyes of so many different people. Where some authors fall flat is when it comes to writing from multiple characters' point of view it making them all unique and have their own""voice"" so the characters don't blend together. Despite my worries, I never once ran into the issue of remembering which POV a chapter is from (it also helped that the novel tells  from whose POV of each chapter is written in under the chapter title). 

**The Characters**

The novel does a really good job at (1) finding a favorite character that you like and (2) making you care for the other characters you are introduced to. Their decisions and way of speaking are believable and easy to understand. My biggest pet peeve with novels that follow a group of teenagers is probably how their diction doesn‚Äôt match how real teenagers speak. Dialogue for me either makes or breaks the story. Luckily, this is where the novel really shines. There was never a moment where I thought a character was just too unbelievable. 

**The Story**

The novel is set up to be a two-parter. The first one takes place during the first semester of the school year. Being honest, I don‚Äôt normally like novels that intentionally chop up their stories, but for some reason, this one sat well with me. I never felt like there was a ‚Äúdown moment‚Äù where I felt like was it unnecessary. 

I found myself constantly getting emotionally invested and sometimes even shedding a few tears with the events that transpired. The letters between one of the main characters and his pen pal also just felt so real and genuine that I kept forgetting this was all fictional‚Ä¶

I can‚Äôt speak on how good part 2 will be since I couldn't find anything online about it, but if it dives deeper to everything that part 1 set up, this might easily become part of my top 10 favorite novels of all time. 

**Closing Thoughts**

This 350-page novel will most likely hit you in waves. Especially if you are around my age or even older and out of high school. I found myself reminiscing on my final years of school quite often.

However, for those who have dealt with a significant loss in the family, I will leave this warning for you: There is a little bit of a dark tone to two of the chapters where one of the main characters covers experiences with the death of his brother in gut wrenching detail that made me take a break from reading and think about the people I‚Äôve lost. The way it was written was masterfully executed. I had goosebumps for nearly the whole chapter when I first read it.

I was honestly just getting so sick of hearing about Denna in general that I kind of hoped she'd be killed off.

Kvothe can also be quite pompous and it was annoying at times. If I had a nickle every time he said ""if you aren't a musician, I don't expect you to understand"". There's also a few parts in the book that made me roll my eyes, especially this part towards the end:

&gt;*I have known her longer,* my smile said. *True, you have been inside the circle of her arms, tasted her mouth, felt the warmth of her, and that is something I have never had. But there is a part of her that is only for me. You cannot touch it, no matter how hard you might try. And after she has left you I will still be here, making her laugh. My light shining in her. I will still be here long after she has forgotten your name.*

books,"Just finished reading it. Incredible work.

However, I do feel like Fussell glosses over too much the longer metrical feet and exotic substitutions (say choriambs and double iambs). English is not Greek or Latin, yes, but it seems absurd to claim that the entirety of English meter can be found in two or *occasionally* three syllable breaks when our grammar quite clearly supports polysyllabic constructions. For example, in Keats' ""On the Sea"":

 *It keeps eternal whisperings around*  
*Desolate shores, and with its mighty swell* 

The ""Desolate shores"" strikes me as pretty blatantly a choriamb, and one meant to evoke the push-and-pull nature of the ocean tides, as opposed to merely a trochee followed by an iamb. Fussell's analysis leaves little room for that kind of observation.

P.S. He recommends the reader to next visit Seymour Chatman's *A Theory of Meter*, **but I have no idea where to get this**. It's been out of print for a long, long time and old copies are on Amazon for $100+ with weeks delay in shipping time.

books,"A discussion about Tom Clancy sprung up in the John Le Carre obituary thread. I was going to comment there, but didn‚Äôt want to hijack that thread. (The passing of Le Carre has hit me hard; one of the giants of postwar fiction)

re Clancy: I have never seen a greater fall-off in fiction quality over a writer‚Äôs career.

Tom Clancy is credited by many with inventing the technothriller genre. And I don‚Äôt think anyone has done it better since. *The Hunt for Red October* and *Red Storm Rising* are the best modern military fiction books I‚Äôve ever read. Others have had commercial success with technothrillers: Coonts, Dale Brown, some Crichton, some James Rollins ‚Äì but IMO no one has equaled the early Clancy books.

Read *The Hunt for Red October* and *Red Storm Rising*. Especially *The Hunt for Red October*. You may find yourself intrigued by topics you didn‚Äôt even know existed ‚Äì things like sonar tactics, antisubmarine warfare, and Warsaw Pact armor strategies (remember when the Warsaw Pact was a thing?)  And Clancy was so detailed and accurate, you may even feel knowledgeable enough to embark on a naval mission.

*Patriot Games* and *The Cardinal and the Kremlin* were decent espionage thrillers, especially Cardinal ‚Äì though not equal to Le Carre, Greene or other masters of the genre. *Clear and Present Danger* kept me entertained.

But I could barely drag myself to the finish line for *Sum of All Fears*.  I started *Debt of Honor* but Clancy‚Äôs writing had devolved into a mix of repetition, cliches, and outlandish and unrealistic plot twists. I‚Äôve flipped through a couple of the later works but couldn‚Äôt stomach them. 

What happened? Was Clancy a one- or two-trick pony? Did the end of the Cold War ruin his plotting, whereas someone like Le Carre was able to adapt and thrive? Did the Jack Ryan universe get overextended ‚Äì might Clancy have reinvigorated his storytelling by ditching Jack Ryan and company and giving us some brand new characters and storylines?

It‚Äôs a shame, because as the John Le Carre thread shows, the consensus is that Tom Clancy and good fiction go together like horse dung and Swiss chocolate. Yet I think his early fiction is highly entertaining and unique ‚Äì a type of storytelling nobody had done before and has never really done since.",An appreciation for early Tom Clancy,1607965133

I feel the water up against my skin and smile from the warm embrace around my entire body. I soak in the lavender, eucalyptus citrus as they permeate through the layers of my skin. What a vessel this body is, what powers it possesses. I am floating in my love as my heartbeats, sending ripples across the surface. Bliss. My mind untethered to the anchors of the realities of this world, joins in harmonious reunion with my soul and body as they vibrate in liquified air. Sunk at the bottom I cry and cry until the water overflows onto the tile floor. It feels so good to feel the tension and heaviness filter out of essence. What magic lay in this place. Within the water. WIthin me.  Milky now and no longer steaming, I pull up on the tub stops. Gravity pulls the water down the drains past my chest, legs, and feet.

books,"After reading The Prestige novel (which, as many others did, I found lackluster compared to the movie) I was left with basically two questions:

1) At the beginning of the novel the author states that a Church was set in the main part of Caldlow House. Moreover, he emphasizes that its Pastor is known for being able to be at two places at the same time (I think he was at once in jail and visiting someone). That seems like a very strange and salient plot point, since that ability connects him with both Borden and Angier. However, nothing is said about him afterwards. What are we supposed to make of his ability? Does he have a twin brother? Or has he used the machine in s faulty way, like Angier, and was left with two 'functional' copies of himself?

2) Andrew Westley is sure has a twin,, which to an extent turns out to be true. However, how is that he can ""hear"" his (dead) copy talk to him? He states twin brothers share q connection and that the phenomenon has been widely documented. But surely that doesn't extend to a dead twin?

I love his adventures, and how he goes all around the world. Also, it gives a really in-depth look into the politics around the Napoleonic Wars.

The only thing I didn't like is how Hornblower is always talking about the French sailors as sloppy or badly-disciplined. At first it didn't make a big impression on me, but it's kind of annoying (probably because I'm not English myself).

Paras, short for Perestroika is a race horse who is very loved and also loves her rider and caretakers, Delphine, Rania and Madeleine, finds the gate of her stall unlatched one day and driven by curiosity decides to check out if the grass is greener on the other side (literally and figuratively) She meets Frida, a German short-hair who is very adept at all human ways especially money - things which were taught to her by her human companion, Jacques.

Paras and Frida meet other animals. Sid and Nancy, a disgruntled mallard couple and Kurt and Conrad, two house mice. But the character which I loved the most was Raoul Corvis Corvax, twenty third of his name, a know-it-all raven. There are some humans in this animal world - Pierre, a gardner, Jerome, a shop owner and Anais, a baker, all of who meet the group at some point.

I felt like it was such a perfect fairytale suitable for all ages. The anthropomorphised animals learn so much. Raoul realizes that he does not know as much as he thinks he does. Frida learns to love other humans since Jacques one day 'disappeared'. It became even more perfect with the introduction of Etienne, a young boy who takes care of his 97 year old great grandmother since he has an innocent perspective of the world and makes the animals feel at home, literally.",I just finished reading Perestroika in Paris by Jane Smiley and I loved it so much ‚ù§,1607945907

&gt;I think the whole point of the series was that the world didn't get any better, they just got better at dealing with it. When you're a kid you think being an adult is like this secret club, but when you get there it's not really any different. There are no special abilities or information you gain when you join VFD, it's not a single moment, you just get more involved in the world and slowly become a part of it, not just being affected by the world but affecting it. Because everyone is in VFD, it's a secret club of which every person in the world is a member.

and

&gt;not just adulthood, but responsibility and maturity. The Volunteer Fire Department, taking the safety of the world into your own hands not because you are forced to but because it is your choice (""volunteer""). When they find out about it in book 5 they think it's the thing that's going to help keep them safe and save them from Count Olaf. But when they actually find it, it's not a thing to keep them safe but a thing they have to keep safe. Adulthood is not impermeability, it is a trial to be overcome.
