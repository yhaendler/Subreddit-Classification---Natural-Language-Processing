datascience,"Hi I know algorithms for building pricing models vary by industry, e.g., GLMs for insurance &amp; financial underwriting vs DL for the price of an Uber.

However, if the goal for pricing models is to output the prices that maximize profit/revenue, aren't data-driven approaches susceptible to learning from flawed data, i.e., previous transactions where a price was too high or too low? I know it's generally infeasible to find the maximum price that a business could charge &amp; still make a sale, but if that optimal price is outside the data you have wouldn't a ML pricing model essentially be useless?

I supposed RL approaches like a multi-armed bandit could be one possible solution, but I'm curious whether my perspective on pricing models is incorrect too.",Pricing model optimization when ML is tied to existing data,1609801889

datascience,"I posted here not too long ago about getting accepted into a masters program for data analytics. My hope is that this program will lead me into a career pivot into the data science field. Full disclosure, I have no idea how this is going to turn out. However, I thought it would be nice to capture my progress over the next year in case someone like myself happens to stumble upon it later. 

My timeline started sometime in October as I realized my current career choice of operations/supply chain management had plateaued. I wanted to pivot into a different field but didn’t want to lose all of the financial benefits I had managed to obtain over the last ten years. I did think about going the self taught route, especially since my undergrad is in economics. However, with two kids and a full time job I knew I would need more skin in the game to make this transition stick.  So, I opted for a structured approach. That lead me to an online program at Northern Illinois University. I did my undergrad through this university and the price was right so I put my application in on 11/15. Around the first week of December I was notified that I had been accepted. The next few weeks were spent trying to figure out a course schedule that would allow me to complete my program in a year. 

Today, 1/4/21 my classes have officially started and I’ve completed all the initial tasks of setting up online learning platforms and study materials. The first classes are supply chain analytics and applied statistics for business with a focus on SAS. 

I’ll update sometime next week and let you all know how these classes are going. I’m sure for a lot of you jumping into a masters program won’t be the correct route.

datascience,"Hi there,

For my MSc research, I am looking at the self-attention mechanism within Transformer models, and whether or not manually adjusting the attention weights can produce interesting results.

One method in which my supervisors suggested the weights could be altered is by transforming the K vectors which are produced by the mechanism. They suggested that by making the K vector more or less similar in some way to a given Q vector, this could potentially result in the weight between the corresponding words to the vectors being higher or lower.

Unfortunately, I do not have much of a background in linear algebra, so I'm not 100% sure about where I could get started with this. I'm guessing that by making the resulting dot product between the two vectors higher/lower somehow, this will result in the weight being higher/lower. I have found a few resources online explaining how to do this in 2 and 3 dimensions, however, the vectors I am working with are 16 dimensions, so I am at a loss with this.

Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions that may help me with this? I have  been stuck on this for a few days now with no luck.

I am doing a project for work where I am trying to predict who will voluntarily leave the company. I have a question on how to actually get the list of predicted people.

1. I train my model on data from 2016 to October 2020.
2. Then I download the employee roster from Nov 1st 2020.

My issue comes from the fact that when i do step three it predicts a value of 0(not leaving the company) for everyone.

I am asking for criticism and help with this since all the online resources I've looked at only show how to do the fitting then testing for model score. It doesnt show how you pull a list of a predictions from your model.

I wanted to ask about the best way to teach yourself data science online. MOOCs? Doing kaggle courses? Taking part in projects? Doing exercises?

For me MOOCs on edx or coursera were not that helpful. I loose attention and get distracted easily when watching videos, it makes me nervous and unattentive. So there is not a single MOOC that I would recommend.

Udacity was different - the Machine Learning Engineer Programme was good, I gained at least some skills - although I would have expected more. So also no enthusiastic recommendation here.

The best thing I found so far was codecademy. The start of a course is often very basic and you get bored or distracted easily then, too, but after some time it gains momentum and becomes interesting.

Another good tipp are kaggle kernels or courses. Having a look at the code there can be quite interesting, and it is completely free.

The same holds for stackoverflow. You have to know what to look for, but almost every question that you can conceive of has been answered here - usually in an excellent way.

So codecademy, kaggle and stackoverflow would be my primary recommendations, although I am still looking for a more thorough, more structured course.

I know the most obvious answer is: 'yes it's called tidyverse'.

I'm just like why the fuck is this thing rotated 90 degrees? Or when I am using the matrix api: why does MARGIN mean 2 different things in sweep() &amp; apply()? Why does norm() not work on vectors? Or more generally if we need to replace the vast majority of the base api with api which makes sense (e.g. library(tidyverse), library(Matrix), etc...) then does the base language of R itself actually offer value?

\- Production code is written procedurally and is very very coupled. Therefore it cannot be reused. Think a piece of code that is so coupled to the XGboost DMatrix that it can't be used for non xgboost projects

\- Code is very coupled to a particular cloud provider

\- General lack of software skills

I have been tasked with making changes and getting people to join my vision but I am struggling due to:

\- People thinking I am a maverick for setting standards. A feedback comment was that someone had said ""there are too many standards, I can't do this anymore"" but that person had also said they hate reading other people's code and tries to avoid it

\- People upset that I am rejecting their PRs for production code almost all the time

\- People not understanding why decoupled and extendable code is good and saves time

I am finding things are a bit slower to progress and my manager has made a few comments about how I am not implementing these changes quick enough

* DevOps and MLOps have the same culture

   * Automating everything 
   * Autonomous teams
   * Continuous improvements and learning from failures
   * All these aspects are true for both DevOps and MLOps
* Tools are the same

   * For metrics, it’s Prometheus
   * For CI/CD, it’s GitLab or something like that
* Experimenting
   * A/B tests existed long before MLOps

I'm a third-year PhD candidate in the Netherlands. My topic is experimental high energy physics, which means my work is essentially data analysis.

During my M.Sc. and the first two years of the PhD I developed a good knowledge of programming (python and C++), statistics and some machine learning algorithms that are used in the field. 
The research is going well, but I really don't see myself staying in academia, for several reasons I'd like to go to industry after I graduate.

From what I have heard in courses/workshops that my university offers to PhDs who want to move to industry, one of the biggest issues are the soft skills.

I currently hold a BSc in Geology and have been employed as a staff geologist for an engineering company for the past year. I don't mind the work, but it is pretty heavy with field work/travel and I don't see myself staying in this field forever (pay is meh, about 65k right now but not a lot of room for advancement in the near future).

datascience,"Hi all - I'm asking for help because you never know what you don't know, and I may be missing some good ideas in my searching:

I'm looking for a data storage format. The input is sensor data, usually 2-4 bytes (including 3-byte), on the order of a few hundred sensors at 5k-100k samples per second, so up to 50MB/second. In addition, there's other sensors, much lower throughput, like 10 samples/second.

Our solution now is working well enough, but is custom-made and therefore requires custom code to read/write/analyze. It basically says ""A block is 1 second of data, and is 50,000 3-byte values for Sensor A and 10 4-byte values for sensor B"" and that metadata goes into a file (like schema, but this was invented like 30 years ago before XML), and then the data file just grows 150,040 bytes every second.

So, in search of a file format that is:  
* Supported - ideally has plugins with MATLAB, C, Python, and LabVIEW. I know I'd be lucky to get 2 of the 4.
* Space efficient. I'm okay with say, 20% overhead. This rules out a lot of ones I've found which insist on metadata for every record, but maybe I just need to think differently. I'm okay with grouping data into 1-second chunks though.
* Supports asynchronous data streams.. or at least synchronous at different (but even multiple of) rates.
* Some metadata (a friendly label to the data, conversion on how to convert from say 0 → 2^N to real world units, etc)
* Support for 3-byte data desired. Otherwise I'm wasting 25% of my space on some systems :)

Since this is on an embedded device, and for sensor data, a lot of the newer features like easy analysis are not needed. The scientists transform this time-series data in order on the full data file, so there's no need for easy access to just one part of the dataset. And files aren't used by multiple users concurrently or anything.

* Statistical intuition (and what the different types of tests mean, like T tests, anova, hypothesis testing, etc)
* How to speak intelligently about the different types of supervised and unsupervised learning (I.e. linear/logistic regression, decision trees, SVM, etc)

I think about previous jobs that used to be high skilled and then became obsolete. Jobs like being a Telegraph operator, call center reps and even a job at McDonald’s decades ago was considered a high skilled or respected.

Any and all feedback would be amazing! 

For some context, here’s a little bit about me:

* Graduated Purdue May 2019 with a 3.97 CGPA
* Working as a Research Software Engineer currently with an Aerospace company in a data analytics team (led and spearheaded a few projects to do with data analysis and ML applied to weather or NLP for software requirements)
* At work, I founded and co-lead an AI/ML community of practice (largest active community in the company) with about 800 members and monthly meetings
* Outside of work, I run a youtube channel and discord community where I showcase my ML projects applied to games and, more recently, help teams of beginners create ML applications. I also am working on my own right now, a recommendation system API that will feed into an anime recommendation website with 70K+ users. 

I’m looking specifically at Brown University’s program right now (they’re the only ones on my list that are still accepting - but I’m open to suggestions). I’m thinking of either their CS MS ([https://www.brown.edu/graduateprograms/computer-science-scm](https://www.brown.edu/graduateprograms/computer-science-scm)) or the Entrepreneurial one ([https://www.brown.edu/graduateprograms/innovation-management-and-entrepreneurship-scm](https://www.brown.edu/graduateprograms/innovation-management-and-entrepreneurship-scm)). 

Here are the questions I had:

* What accomplishments should I focus on to stand out in my application?
* I plan on reaching out to current faculty and grad students at Brown, what are the best ways to approach this? What questions would be most insightful?
* Are there other schools which have applications open that are good to consider?
* Should I take a technical masters as opposed to one focused on management? I love coding but have historically enjoyed leadership as well, plus it seems like it’ll provide a good diversity in skills.
* What are the best ways to reduce the cost of grad school tuition? I’ve heard TA-ing is great but I’m sure it is equally competitive so I’m open to other ideas.
* Is there anything else I should be doing to make myself stand out in the next month or so?
