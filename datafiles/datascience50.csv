datascience,"Hello,

So currently I am working as a data scientist and started studying again on top.
Apparently, I have total chaos at home now regarding hardware.

Company guidelines allow me to do testing and prototyping on private hardware (which I do, as I have it available and it is way faster than asking IT for Ressources every time).

Currently I have a small Xeon server running Ubuntu with docker and a jupyter server, a private workstation laptop (heavy and clumsy), an powerful windows desktop, a Mac mini by my company, a laptop by my company, and an private iPad Pro („laptop replacement“).

The result is total chaos. Data of my private projects gets cluttered everywhere, I sometimes hook up laptops to docking stations even if I would need the power of the desktop as I don’t want to waste time setting up virtual Python environments over and over again, and so on.

And I feel like it’s becoming more and more of a problem as my work and studying evolves. Sometimes I just need to setup an entire new Hadoop or Spark System for testing or a few databases or whatever.

So I am thinking about what to do. I thought about upgrading my server and only rely on the server and a thin and light „dumb terminal“-Laptop. But it would be a lot of work managing, maybe expensive, and impair my work on the go as I have to work in environments where it is often simply not possible to connect to my home VPN.

The point is basically that I overall don’t need much for the most time. Python, maybe a jupyter Notebook, and that’s it. But I often stumble on points where I just suddenly need a GPU for CUDA or a few databases or a few virtual machines. And evertime one of those needs comes up I have to move my entire work up until that point from the more mobile but weak to the more static but powerful hardware (iPad -&gt; Laptop -&gt; Desktop &lt;-&gt; Server).

Another alternative I was thinking about getting an thin and light Laptop with not much power and and an mediocre desktop at home that’s just there to have a lot of storage and connect to multiple displays. I could then maybe run every project (like a single node Spark System or Django development) in an public cloud environment like on an AWS machine. This would skip the migration step from one of my hardware pieces to another and save me a lot of time and headache.
But this implys a long term problem. It would be expensive to pay the upkeep of every single instance that’s not needed at the moment. So I would need a way to archive an entire cloud machine locally in case I need the work maybe months later again.
I have no idea if AWS or anything provided this ability or if this idea makes financially any sense at all.

So how do you handle the hardware demands for your data science (especially data engineering) needs? Where do you prototype and test for maybe personal projects and how do you treat your work to not loose anything in the long run and can reuse it?
Any experiences with the ideas I had?

Every input, suggestion or idea highly appreciated.

datascience," I am currently in a Data Analyst role for a local government. I want to build my portfolio in hopes of moving into a more formal Data Science role. To achieve this, I plan to develop a series of projects in Kaggle, build out an inventory of tools to share on Git. I also plan to find new ways to implement ML or DL concepts in my present work using existing raw data, potentially including image data. 

 In my work, we work closely with a GIS team who curates our department’s geospatial data in ArcGIS. I am developing proficiency in Esri tools. 

 At this time, I am weighing the value of doubling down on filling gaps in my math education vs. developing stronger skills in Python/R/SQL. Or both on a longer timeline.

 How valuable is it to use time to address this skill-gap? Taking college-level courses in calculus, multi-variable calculus, linear algebra and discrete math for example will take many years. 

 Realistically, I am at the beginning of this journey. I have a bachelors with a major in Anthropology with some focus in Archaeology, but I do not have a strong background in analytics. Although I can work through data science concepts and use data science tools on the computer, I suspect mathematical education to be a major hurdle. 

 I’m open to suggestions and know that any strong path forward will take a few years. I’m prepared to do the work but need to find the best way to optimize my time. 

 I am not opposed to doing master’s work, but I want to make sure my ducks are in a row and find the right program. Here are some details about my current credentials:

\-  Three years’ employment in a Grant Manager/Digital Resource Manager role in Nonprofit

\-  Developing proficiency in Special Data Science

At this point, I'm definitely a junior data scientist at best - I know a lot of theory but don't have a ton of experience applying concepts, and much of my work involves reporting on historical data.

For those that might be interested, please be sure you can meet the following requirements:

* You must be an active practitioner with at least 5 years of experience with:
   * Problem formulation
   * Data collection &amp; cleansing
   * Data analysis &amp; modeling
   * Experience working on various predictive analytics, machine learning, and perhaps even artificial intelligence
   * Experience with different algorithms and technologies (classifiers, regression, neural networks, etc.)
   * Presenting results to stakeholders that they can understand in their terms and can easily comprehend
   * Deploying models, maintaining deployed models, retraining, enhancing production models, etc.
* Provide your resume (via LinkedIn or PDF)

I've been attempting to use BO to optimize a black box function, and started by using [https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization)

In the BO python package above, there is a concept of ""Domain Reduction"", which when used with my black box function has been very successful in rapidly finding near optimal ranges for 26 parameters, some Choice and some Int/Float Range. I've linked it here:

I've been struggling to understand two things:

1. Is this somewhat already implemented (bounds tightening, domain reduction, in any sense) in the Ax project?
