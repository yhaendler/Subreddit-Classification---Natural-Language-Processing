books,"So I am half way through Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman and I can honestly say that it is the best read of my entire life. 

I have yet to meet a single person who has heard of it yet alone read it! It is genuinely a masterpiece of literature and one of the best novels that no one has ever heard of.

This novel doesn't try to make statement or claims or try and make judgement of anything or anyone. All this book is about is people. People and their struggles with other people and with the burning human desire to be free and independent in a regime and environment in which the individual is expendable. A book about the sad, the bad, the mad, the good and everything inbetween all written by a man who experienced all of this first hand during WW2.

books,"I have started writing a novel for adults, and started to realize I hate purple prose. Well, not hate. But I generally dislike overlaying adjectives and descriptive imagery when I can get straight to the point in explaining things. Unless there is a specific kind of picture I want to convey to the reader, I tend to not care about flowery words.

I noticed this is how I read too. I am not the best reader, but I tend to skip over paragraphs that are too overdrawn (sorry George RR Martin) in the middle of the page and simply skim over it so I can get to more intriguing parts. By ""more intriguing"" I mean dialogue, and/or new descriptions on objects.

Ernest Hemingway has a style I love (not that I am attempting to emulate his in any way), I personally love how concise and straight to the point it can get, while conveying depth.

My question, in my search for more books that are geared for adults, yet mostly lack flowery words and get to the point (and are more cut and dry), where should I look? I'm not discrediting flowery prose at all, there is certainly a time and place to use it. I just find that there are some books that go a bit too far with that style of prose, and it bothers me. Not because I am a terrible reader (I am new to reading) I just find it annoying sometimes and holding me back from the actual story.

I guess, I also wonder if it is a good thing to have a taste like this, or if there is such a thing as a ""bad"" taste. Purple prose irks me when used enough times, but I haven't quite read many books that have a more clear and concise prose, and has more emphasis on dialogue and simple, straight to the point prose that drives the story. I am attempting to look for books in that kind of style, if that makes sense, based on what I have described.

TLDR: I want to find more books that are adult-oriented with mature themes, but are less flowery in their prose and more concise and straight to the point. I'm not saying I want to read ""easy"" books, just books that are adult-oriented but aren't as layered with purple prose.

The average author doesn't make a ton of money. So pirating their book screws them over in a big way. They need people to buy their books or check them out at the library in order to keep writing.

What makes it more frustrating is when people pirate a series. If a book doesn't make enough in sales, the publisher may cancel the series, so you end with a permanent cliff hanger. That is super annoying.

books,"I have a pretty large book collection at this point, although it's hard for me to estimate how many books I have. At my place, I have three bookshelves—one large, nice one, and two smaller cheap ones from Amazon. All three are filled, and the large bookshelf has some excess books stacked on top. I could probably fill another shelf with the books that don't fit, but I don't have room for one.

Anyway, most of that is beside the point, because my question is about organization. There is no rhyme or reason to the way I have my books arranged, other than what fits where. I'd like to maybe change this, but there are a few problems.

First of all, if I wanted to arrange books by author, there are a lot of instances where I have a portion of a specific authors work in paperback and a few in hardback or vice versa. This would mean I'd have to mix in hardback books within rows of paperbacks (right now, the hardbacks are generally on either the far left or right of the shelves in groups).

This would also be a problem if I wanted to arrange the books by genre or any other broad categorizations. The sizes would start looking really weird mixed in with each other.

books,"A particular example of mine is the first part of the 14th chapter of Red Storm Rising, ""Gas"". Essentially, it's just a technical document followed by bureaucrats discussing the issues raised in the document. Sounds like filler, right?

&gt;In  terms  of  immediate  effects,  the  10,000,000+  civilian  fatality  floor  figure  in  Scenario  2 represents  a  public  health  problem  worse  by  an  order  of  magnitude  than  that  following  the Bangladesh Cyclone disaster of 1970, and is likely to include synergistic effects well beyond the scope of this study. (Contract specifications specifically excluded investigation into bio-ecological effects  from  a  major  chemical  exchange.  While  the  difficulty  associated  with  an  in-depth examination of this subject is impossible at this writing to estimate, the reader is cautioned that such far-reaching effects are less easily dealt with than studied. It might be necessary, for example, to import tons of insect larvae before the simplest food crops can again flourish in Western Europe.) For the moment the ability even of organized armies to dispose of millions of civilian bodies in advanced stages of decomposition is not something to be taken for granted. And the civilians needed  for  the  reestablishment  of  industrial  production  (under  what  are  almost  certainly optimistic estimates) will have been at the least decimated in the literal, classical sense.


The document ends with a bit of shock and horror: the potential outcome of the use of chemical weapons in Germany. Can you imagine the place you live in being so devastated that you have to ship pollinators for plant life to flourish again? This possibility troubles the top East German officials discussing the report.


&gt;""In fact,"" said Colonel Mellethin, director of Foreign Operations Analysis--he was a spare, austere man with eyes that clearly had not known sleep for some days--""the Americans understate the total quantities  of  munitions  employed,  because  they  consistently  overstate  the  accuracy  of  Russian delivery systems."" The other two men in the room noted at once that *Russian* had been substituted for *Soviet*.


With the USSR ramping up for a war effort, such division among the Warsaw Pact members presents a problem. East German leadership even considers that the possible eradication of German culture is an objective of the planners in Moscow, where the story turns to next.


&gt;""I feel that we should retain control of these weapons in the Politburo. Comrade Defense Minister,are you telling us that we can win only if weapons of mass destruction are used?"" The old man leaned forward and spoke with harsh determination. ""Has the situation changed? You will remember telling us that if strategic surprise were lost, our armies could be recalled. Has surprise been lost?"" 

&gt;The Defense Minister's face went rigid for a moment. ""The Soviet Army is ready and able to carryout its mission. It is now too late to retreat. This is also a political question, Petya.""

&gt;""NATO is mobilizing,"" Sergetov said.""Too late, and too halfheartedly,"" replied the Director of the KGB. ""We have split one country from the NATO alliance. We are working on others, and are hard at work throughout Europe and America  spreading  disinformation  about  the  bomb  attack.  The  will  of  the  people  in  the  NATO countries is low. They will not want to fight a war for German murderers, and their political leaders
will find a way to disassociate themselves from the conflict.""

&gt;""But not if we slaughter civilians with gas."" The Foreign Minister nodded. ""Petya and young Sergetov are correct: the political cost of these weapons is simply too high.""


A heated discussion that reveals what the hawkish Defense Minister is willing to do, and the cooler heads that oppose him. To conclude, this section advances characterization of important figures and explains key plot elements (in this case, why does the USSR not resort to theater-wide biotoxic and chemical warfare?).",What's a part of a book you like that sounds boring on paper but is actually quite interesting?,1580851920

I always remember the main character Eric having to try and cope with the curse of turning into a dog. His best friend was always at hand to help him; however, he always tried to keep it secret from his family. This always used to get me thinking how hard it would be to hide such a secret from friends and family. It proves quite tricky for him especially in day to day life when the curse would kick in and he would have to run away and hide so no one would see the transformation. 

The book was basically a story of learning how to cope with his new found power, and how he would adapt it into his everyday life. This made for some interesting situations.

I was excited to see where Terry Hayes was going to take Scott Murdoch next and what dangers awaited him but I was quickly disappointed when I realized that the follow up book doesn't seem to have him as the main protagonist.

Instead I believe the Year of the Locust takes place about 15 years later and Murdoch is the head of the United States' intelligence.

I guess what I'm trying to get to is that it would be such a let down if the year of the locust isn't a direct sequal to I am Pilgrim.

I would argue that, much like the rest of the book, there is a rational explanation: anaphylaxis. He died of an allergic reaction to a wasp sting. In the scene where Dotty receives the first letter from Sir Thomas, asking for her hand in marriage, she gets stung by a wasp in the garden and comments multiple times on how painful it is. It’s a random detail that struck me as completely out of place, and I couldn’t see why it was written into the story until I got to the end. His symptoms correspond to anaphylactic shock. We know he has just crossed the garden on his way back into the house. This would explain his immediate death. 

I’ve seen a few complaints about the ending, but rather than cheapening the story, I find that the ending highlights that Ruth, given the choice, behaved in a moral and innocent way, whereas Dorothea chose to give in to her darker impulses and was nowhere near as nice as she pretended to be.

books,"Hi all

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished reading The Silver Wind by Nina Allan and found it... quite honestly a terrible book. There was no continuous story and it seemed all the writer did was put together a few random scenes, re-use names to create a semblance of continuity, and some wishy-washy jabbery-jab about how time is not linear but like a room with many doorways.

&amp;#x200B;

(Disclaimer: I feel a bit stupid posting this. I feel as if, because of its acclaim, I should have picked up on what makes it so appealing and all, and that I'm probably not enough of a connoisseur(TM) to understand this kind of 'high literature' or whatever you want to call. However, I'd like to understand what other readers got out of this book, if anything, and why this is so difficult for me to grasp. Or, contrary, to be validated in my poor opinion of it.)

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if someone can help me understand why this book has such critical acclaim. There was nothing in it that gave it the merit it apparently received. I found the mechanical time travel premise (turbillon in watches) of the book interesting, however, the execution was a terrible mess.

&amp;#x200B;

Part 1: all right, this is a somewhat coherent beginning, but the main character reads like a mentally somewhat backwards creep (I guess this is explained a bit later by the wishy-washy ghost impressions of other worlds and what not, but it still reads like Owen Andrews is some kind of predator a lot of the time, and the woman, Angela, is not better in the least). The villain of that part, Angela's father, is never mentioned again throughout the whole book and well, all the tension built up in those first few scenes is lost after Part 1 ends.

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2: I think I get it? We're learning more about time works in the novel and how some characters have different stories and different counterparts in different worlds. Ok. I can almost deal with it, even though there's a lot of incest and all.

&amp;#x200B;

Part3/Afterword/Take-outs: What the hell was the point of these? They have nothing to do with any of the rest of the Owen/Martin/Dora focused story and just introduce random characters no one knows or cares about. The in the last part, the author goes back on her premise of time not being linear and has her character Dora (another version of Dora) perfectly time travel in a linear line back and forth.

&amp;#x200B;

So to sum up, my main questions are:

1. Was anyone able to make sense of the greater meaning of this book? What is the moral? What is the point? What is the author trying to say?
2. Was Owen always (part 1) a dwarf or only in part 2?
3. Who the hell is Lenny and why should anyone care? Who is Malcolm, for that matter? (I probably got confused about the timelines here, as I believe Malcolm is later mentioned again by Dora in some way.)

I would really like to contribute to reviews (which is not really important, but since I am student of English I read and discuss books quite often). In any case, as much as I have been dealing with books (also in-depth, because of my studies), quite often I find myself inable to write a proper review, because I am not sure how to be constructive in either a positive or critical way. Plus the fact that I don't think the discussions I have about the books I read are of any importance in a review.

Because of this I often need to interrupt my reading and look back to where this name first appeared, and sometimes I mix up characters and get the story wrong for a while until I realize and have to re-read all of it.

books,"I’m 16 and I remember in middle school everyone was obsessed with Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Mortal Instruments, the Hunger Games, the Selection etc. But now people around me are reading much more complex books and classical literature.

Do you think young adult novels are a good prerequisite in order to build a foundation? 

I feel like I missed out on a whole era of books and am behind now. I want to be well read and broaden my thinking/knowledge, can YA satisfy my needs?

books,"I just finished Bunny by Mona Awad and have no idea what the heck I just read. I just had some kind of experience, but I'm not sure what kind of experience, although I'd guess it involves hallucinations.  I also hear a lot of people talk about this as satire but I thought it was a pretty strong Horror story (although I'm not strong enough in that conviction that I was willing to post this to /r/horrorlit...yet...)

I had a great time reading, although I'm not yet sure how much I did or didn't like it. I was completely bewildered the whole time I was reading, which only made me more bewildered to actually understand how everything was wrapped up at the end (well, ""understand"" is relative here)... 

I want to preface the following by saying that I chose to read this book very literally.  I can (and might) ruminate on some of the things that might have been metaphors for something deeper (or just grad school), but I personally had more fun reading this presented exactly how it was.

Anyway, 

[Spoiler](#s ""Where did the Bunny's come from?  The women, I mean.  Clearly they were friends.  Clearly they had a bond.  But how was it forged into something so...supernatural? It was Warren, right?  The school itself, or the area where it was?  I don't know if I believe that sort of sorcery exists just in that universe, but it did seem like it permeated Warren.  I'd be hard pressed to believe that Ursula didn't have at least some association with the Bunny's *or bunnies or general literal anthropomorphism."")

I know a lot of people position this mostly as a book about belonging or loneliness.  Maybe it is.  I just know I really wanted to understand and get more about the Bunny's. They were, sure, [Spoiler](#s ""evil and horribly insecure but they were also not stupid.  As female characters they were both a total satire of the popular girl so long as that popular girl also had some agency and smarts about her, and knew very clearly what she wanted.  For how insecure they were, they were at least interesting.  There were such strong hints as to how different before they assimilated...I can only imagine learning more about them.  Also I'm not going to lie...I'm not so sure I'd ever stop making imaginary friends once I started.  It seems almost as addictive as the feeling of being wanted/loved/seen."") 

Anyway - unlike anything I've ever read, I need to read it again to better digest, and I'm asking for forgiveness in advance if my views on this keep evolving as I think about it/discuss it more. 

Has anyone here read it?  What did you think?",Bunny by Mona Awad (Spoilers aplenty),1580828507
books,"Guy Gavriel Kay’s Lions of Al-Rassan is a sprawling tale of love, loyalty, tribal conflict, and the true price of war. The novel tells the story of the peoples of the Al-Rassan by following the narrative of several of its members. The three main characters are Jehane, an Kindath doctor, Ammar ibn Khairan, an Ashar elite, and Rodrigo, a Jaddite general. The arc of each of these characters is rich and developed and gives the reader a good overview of each of their cultures experiences in this world as well as a very personal perspective of how it affects individuals within those cultures.

The Lions of Al-Rassan is extremely well crafted as Kay makes all the moving parts work seamlessly together. One aspect of Kay’s writing that I found to be really interesting was how he would narrate a singular event from multiple character perspectives seamlessly within the same chapter. This book did come across to me as more historical fiction, a genre that does not normally appeal, than fantasy to me, it was elegantly crafted. The writing compelled me to read methodically, taking time to digest the story and scenes at a slower pace and I found that interesting.

The Lions of Al-Rassan is a wonderful book, with a huge variety of characters, cultures, and points of view. It isn’t difficult to make connections to real life conflicts and prejudices which adds another layer to this rich and complex book. The Lions of Al-Rassan is well worth the investment.",[REVIEW] The Lions of Al-Rassan,1580828153

books,"an emotional mess. Where I don't know if I am crying because I am happy, sad, mad, or just tired of reading a book I couldn't put down. Literally. ;) Once in a while I go through my dry spells - my brain feels like it's frying when I don't read something. However, I do go through times when either I just don't want to, or I am too cool for the people around me, or I just can't find the time. I need to learn to appreciate the little books. I am only into books with at least 300 pages. Anywho. There was a time when I think I let my brain fry a little to much. It was hard for me to concentrate, even just to read a sign. It was pretty bad. There was only one author who brought me out of that spell - Danielle Steel. Her writing is so simple yet it made me use my imaginantion, something I thought I had lost. Her and Sandra Cisneros are my fave.
