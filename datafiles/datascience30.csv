datascience,Hello everyone. I will complete a bachelor degree in economics by next year and I am willing to take graduate studies in Data Science in the USA. Do you have some hints for me? I mean will I be able to get into a  decent university with this bakcground?,Looking for an university.,1590358141

datascience,"So a little background about myself. After completing GCSE's, I became sick for a few months which meant that I couldn't go on to Sixth Form. While being stuck at home I rekindled my passion for programming and even freelanced a little building websites for some local businesses. I was happy that I wouldn't have to go to University since I'd spoken to some software engineers who didn't have degrees. When I recovered, I decided that instead of resuming my education I would try to find a job using the new skills that I had gained.

It was tough finding a business that would hire me (I was 19 at the time) but eventually I did manage to find a position as a Junior Software Engineer. The owners wanted a Software Engineer for as cheap as possible because the business was very new and I was so happy with getting the job that I settled for terrible pay (around £15k).

While working here, I had access to vast quantities of data. That's when I began getting interested in Machine Learning and Data Science. My bosses are both insufferable but I stayed because as long as I completed the tasks that were assigned to me and I had permission from the data provider, my bosses basically gave me the freedom to do whatever I wanted to with the data.

Eventually, they actually began to profit off of my ""tinkering"" by selling my insights. I continued to study Data Science in my spare time and about a year into my employment they decided that I was more valuable to them working as a Data Scientist. I managed to convince them to give me a 5k pay bump.

Fast forward to now, I've been working at the same company for 3 years. At this point, the company is bringing in significantly higher revenue due to the additional services that I've been offering our clients. I decided that maybe it's time to ask for another raise which I believed was fair. My bosses basically laughed me out of the office saying that 20k is more than enough for a 22 year old and to come back in 2-3 years and ask for a raise.

I don't think my request was unreasonable but the fact that they both laughed in my face made me realise that maybe it's time to move on. I began looking at job postings for Data Scientists in the UK and my heart sank. They all require a minimum of a Computer Science degree which I don't have. It was clear that I'm at a dead-end. Apparently you can be a software engineer without a degree but you can't be a Data Scientist without a degree.

Now I know that it doesn't matter how accomplished I become or how much experience I have, my credibility will always be called into question by the majority of employers since I don't have a degree. I don't want this to hold me back and I'm still relatively young and early on in my career so I came to the conclusion that I need to go to University. I've spoken to a few and assuming that I pass the entry exam, one university in particular accepted my work experience in lieu of A-levels and I should be starting University in September.

Sorry for the wall of text but that brings me onto my questions. By the time I graduate I'll be 26 years old (3 years for Bachelor and 1 year for Masters).

\-How put off will employers be that I essentially have a 4 year gap in my employment history due to studying at University?

\-Will I be at a disadvantage over someone who graduated university first *and then* gained the same amount of experience?

\-After university should I apply for ""Entry level/Junior Data Scientist"" roles or just ""Data Scientist"" roles?

Not a data scientist, but I find the field really interesting so I started working on a mini project lately with Python for fun.

I'm scraping tweets that mention a certain topic and running sentiment analysis on them to get an average daily score ranging from -1 to 1. I'm interested in learning how sentiment towards this topic will change over time. Right now, I'm getting scores of around 0.07 ~ without much variance on a day-by-day basis. I expect this to change over time, but maybe it will only go up to like 0.09 or down to 0.06.

What could be pitfalls of using an online learning Epsilon greedy algorithm based on CLV to govern who gets what marketing campaign?

Another term for what I am talking about here is called a NBA or Next Best Action. NBAs are usually chosen using hard-coded rules to set my marketing teams. Here we want to consider the online learning algorithm Epsilon greedy based on CLV, or rather ""Expected-Delta-CLV"" to choose the NBA. This would be approaching Marketing as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem. The actions here (of the Next Best Action) are the campaigns, the strategy the marketeer has in mind on how to convince a person to buy (think basic Cialdini principles applied to multimedia content, Banner images, email content, ...).

Take for example a service provider that sells multiple services (say 5+) to millions of people (say less than 20 million) so mid-size company. They want to automate the process of deciding which marketing campaign they should use for which customers. Campaigns have goals, things like Up-Sell, Cross-Sell, and Acquisition. Their marketing department wants to be able to periodically add new campaigns (or versions that are tweaks of older campaigns) to the mix. Their campaigns always have exactly one goal from a fixed set of predefined goals(e.g. Up-Sell, Cross-Sell, and Acquisition,...). The Data Science team wants to have the company’s existing(out of scope) real-time event-based marketing platform be used to host an Epsilon Greedy algorithm that optimizes the choice of campaign. Now implementing a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) for campaigning isn't new and there is a lot of research done as to how to do it well. What I would like for us to consider is optimizing on Expected-Delta-CLV.  

“Customer Lifetime Value” CLV is pretty straight forward(See Wikipedia). Let's assume the Data Science team already has models that predict the likelihood of contract renewal, the likely number of months the customer will stay out of contract, and the other probabilities you can think of to predict CLV. Let's say the model has already proven itself so this is for the most part out of score here, lets just assume they have a pretty good one.  

The ""Delta"" comes from the idea that a campaign being successful should result in a different CLV than the CLV that the customer would have had if marketing did nothing (no campaign, so a control group). At this point it's good to note we are talking about normal campaigns (Banner images on our website, email content, ...) for people that opted-in to receive Marketing campaigns for the company’s s services. The CLV model is parametrized with the data the customer consented for them to use and has shown itself to be pretty good with a 2-year horizon.  

The ""Expected"" comes from the fact that campaigns cannot make anyone do anything, so the campaigns fail most of the time, but they are more effective than doing nothing. This has been proven in the literature using a global control group as a baseline for conversions. The control group is a set of people that even though they opted-in the company shows them neutral content (e.g. their logo). This control group is also used for the ""Delta"" calculation since it provides the Prior probabilities on campaign success factors (e.g. Up-Sell, Cross-Sell, and Acquisition,...), so also the post-conversion CLV.  

Back to ""Expected"", this has to do with a term called conversion-rate, put simply, the ratio of people that convert (do the thing the campaign was designed for) to the people that saw the campaign (impressions). Conversion-rates are normalized by the conversion-rate of doing nothing (Control group). Let's say we are talking fairly large numbers here, millions of customers, thousands of conversions a month, 10+ campaigns that run for as long as they need for them to get a statistically significant effect against the control group, or one year, which ever comes first. If a campaign is successful they would likely keep it running as the champion campaign. They could even have multiple champion campaigns with the same goal but work for different types of people (Contextual Multi-Armed bandit), but that is for a later phase.

So my question to the community is what pitfalls do you think should be considered. Things like:

* Calculating the conversion-rate over a large enough time/number-of- conversion to avoid chaotic behavior.
* How do you deal with the most common case where you know relatively very little about the person so your CLV will we off.
* How do you ""explore"" with other campaigns but ensure the campaign is still relevant for that person (not trying to selling ice to someone that you know already has a refrigerator, in an automated way).
* How to deal with seasonality, a campaign might be bad one month but do good in the winter.
* Cold start problem, what conversion-rate do you give a new campaign.
* How do you make sure you have a large enough control group for every campaign.",Online learning Epsilon greedy algorithm based on CLV to govern who gets what marketing campaign,1590306722

I'm wondering whether to take a math-heavy and full technical degree, such as data science OR applied stats under business schools like business analytics.

I've been working on data &amp; analytics in the last 5 years. I have a CS degree with 3.8/4 GPA. One thing to note is **I only took 1 calculus module** instead of 2 back then (the usual CS degree offered 2 moduls/1 year of calculus). Some programs, such as UCL's data science require at least two calculus modules.

I aimed high and applied to Oxford &amp; UCL but unfortunately got rejected. I'm aware that I need to sharpen my math so I took a calculus class in Coursera while applying. This rejection makes me think perhaps my work &amp; education experience is more suitable for applied stats instead of pure statistics degree.

I'm pretty happy being on the applied side so far (e.g. using XGBoost model with practical knowledge but not the math behind it). Need your advice regarding what factors I should consider for deciding this.

If I decide to keep pursuing statistics/data science degree, I could try at least two things:

* Apply to non-ivy league schools
* Take more calculus/math certificates; however, I don't know whether the univ will trust a Coursera's calculus certificate.

I am currently wanting to construct predictive models to identify patients who may have a misdiagnosis of a certain disease. However, the issue is that I have multiple databases and I do not want to combine the data into one set, so I need to create predictive models for each database. On top of that, I wanted to use different model approaches and use the most accurate model.  

I'm currently facing the problem of determining a way to identify the optimal decision threshold to categorize the results of the predictive model as having been misdiagnosed (p=1) or not having been misdiagnosed (p=0). I've read about how we can use Youden's Index to determine the optimal cutoff for a model, but since I'll have multiple models for each of the database, would it make sense to use the SAME cuttoff across all the models and databases or have one for each database (but keep it consistent for each model within the database)? I'm a bit lost on what the best approach is. I haven't been able to find papers that provide detail on how they determine optimal decision thresholds when they have multiple models

datascience,"Hello,

I’m submitting this post in hopes of receiving feedback regarding a project that I’m working on. I need a sanity check to ensure that there isn’t a blatant flaw in my logic that I’m overlooking.

**Overview of the problem:**
I am trying to identify the highest valued actions a customer can take during their life cycle. This specific scenario takes place in the restaurant industry.

The output I’m working towards is applying a monetary value to actions a customer could take during a particular ‘event’. An event could be the customers first transaction, and in this example, I want to identify the three highest value actions a customer can take during this event. As for an action, this could be anything that a customer has control over when engaging with the company (e.g. the day of the week they visited, what specific products they ordered, which location they went to, etc.).

The first approach I took to solve this problem was training numerous classifier model which would classify whether a customer would be a low or high value customer. From this classifier, I built another model which would extract individual feature importance value (e.g. what day of the week was most important in predicting a low versus high value customer). Long story short, it worked, kind of, but it was heavily convoluted and difficult to convey to stakeholders. 

**Current solution:**
When I went to test the validity of the output that I produced from my initial model attempt, I realized that there might be an incredibly elegant and explanatory solution to this problem.

What I have done is built an algorithm to process simple hypothesis tests (via two sample, two tailed t-tests) on every possible action a customer can decide to make on their first transaction (e.g. the day of the week they visited, what specific products they ordered, which location they went to, etc.).

**Here’s a sample experiment/hypothesis:**
Population: Any person who made their first transaction within the last 365 days

Group A: All customers who did purchase an alcoholic beverage on their first transaction

Group B: All customers who did not purchase an alcoholic beverage product on their first transaction

H0: u total amount spent over Group A’s life cycle == u total amount spent over Group B’s life cycle 

Ha: u total amount spent over Group A’s life cycle != u total amount spent over Group B’s life cycle 

**Results:**
p-value: 0.0000001
Average total amount spent in Group A’s life cycle: $500
Average total amount spent in Group B’s life cycle: $200
Value added: $300
+/-: $50

Conclusion: At a confidence level of 99%, there is enough evidence to claim that customer who purchase an alcoholic beverage on their first transaction produce a higher average total amount spent over their life cycle than those who do not purchase an alcoholic beverage

I processed this hypothesis for every single individual action possible for a customer to take. The hypothesis tests consider nothing different between the groups other than whether or not the specific action was taken by the customer. 

**Here’s the question:**
Am I interpreting these results incorrectly? Is there something I’m missing? 

This seems too good and simple to be true, but I can’t find a hole in this approach. Per the sample hypothesis I provided above, is it wrong to conclude (in consideration to only a raw total amount spent metric) that customers who purchase an alcoholic beverage on their first transaction will, on average, spend more than a customer who doesn’t?

I appreciate any feedback / review of this submission.

probability that the inflation will be 12% or higher in one year

probability that the inflation will be between 8-12% in one year 

probability that the inflation will be between 4-8% in one year

 probability that the inflation will be between 2-4% in one year

Income under 50k, Income between 50-100k. Income over 100k.

What would be the best way to find out which persons with which characteristics are good at predicting the real inflation?
