books,"I've never understood the interpretation of Hamlet that argues that Hamlet's madness and rage are fully or partially driven by his Oedipus complex. Sure, many of Hamlet's remarks towards Gertrude throughout the play are inappropriately sexual, even more so considering the period that the play was set in. Despite that, and many other arguments in favour of the existence of Hamlet's Oedipus complex, I am not compelled to agree with the interpretation and I personally believe that it greatly undermines the play.

books,"And I don't just mean the basic elements of ""musclebound badass in sword-and-sorcery setting"". I feel Howard managed something very special with the *feel* of the setting itself; there is a genuine sense of immense age to the various ruins, monsters and forgotten peoples Conan encounters. The setting itself is amoral and brutish and Conan reflects that. He isn't *evil*, but then neither is a lion.

Overall, Howard's Conan stories are a mix of shameless power fantasy, sword and sorcery and a bit of cosmic horror, mixed with everything feeling very primal and old. Has anyone else pulled this off?","Anything similar to Conan the Barbarian, by Robert E. Howard?",1588202363
books,"I’ve wrote some posts on this forum. Some have been applauded others despised. I am a solitary figure and books give me great joy in life. Finding Reddit and having this ability to communicate with others around the world on topics I love is something I am really grateful for. I have already began to make friends in this community and I look forward to this continuing. 

This is a list of my own favourite books. The ones that have impacted my own life greatly. Some will also have read and loved these books and others will have not. Either way feedback and discussion is truly welcome and I’d love to hear what you think. Of course there are numerous amazing books out there and I’m excited to discover more that also impact on me. These are just my current favourites and ones that will forever live in my heart. 

Novels 

1. A Farewell to Arms - Ernest Hemingway 
(Whilst I can never say for sure, this will always be my favourite book) 
2. For Whom the Bell Tolls - Ernest Hemingway 
3. The Great Gatsby - F. Scott Fitzgerald 
4. The Catcher in the Rye - JD Salinger ( absolutely incredible, a book I return to consistently) 
5. Things Fall Apart - Chinua Achebe 
( my first introduction to African Literature but after this masterpiece it will not be my last) 
6. Lolita - Vladimir Nabokov 
(It takes a true genius to make us care so much for a character as despicable as Humbert Humbert) 
7. The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho 
(Reading this is a spiritual experience unlike any other) 
8. The Wind in the Willows - Kenneth Grahame
( perhaps the most loveable characters I have ever come across. Every child deserves to enjoy this book) 
9. Siddhartha - Herman Hesse 
10. Brave New World - Aldous Huxley
(The ending of this book disturbed me immensely) 
11. 1984 - George Orwell 
12. The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway ( I am a huge Hemingway fan and he is my favourite writer. I have been moved by most books on this list but his works are the only ones  that all have the ability to move me to tears) 
13. Infinite Jest ? ( I have not finished this book but I absolutely love it. It is unique piece of work unlike anything in its use of language and imagination. I will be very surprised if it’s not one of my favourites by the time I have finished it.)

Non-Fiction 

Whilst I prefer fiction I do love non-fiction as well these are some of my favourite works. 

1. Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari 
( this changed my world view forever) 
2. The Autobiography of Malcolm X - Malcolm X 
3. Jobs - Walter Isaacson
(I now more than ever what to put my own dent in the universe) 
4. 12 Rules for Life - Jordan Peterson 
5. Recovery - Russell Brand

books,"On this day (April 29) in 1986, a huge fire ravaged the Los Angeles Central Library. To this day there is some mystery as to how it started.

This is the main topic of Susan Orleans's book, but she covers other library-related topics as well, including the history of the library, and the system today. 

Overall, I thought the story was interesting and the book informative. However, I also felt it goes on tangents that made it feel at points like the author was trying to reach a word count. For example, there is one section describing an ""experiment"" by the author to burn a book. It felt so gimmicky I almost stopped reading at that point.

A moment of regret for all of the books lost during the fire. And I'd like to hear your thoughts if you've read the book!",The Library Book by Susan Orlean [mild spoilers],1588198732
books,"OK, so this post might be a violation of r/books rules, but i read them, and while this isn't specifically prohibited, it definitely feels like i'm violating the spirit of the rule. I try to be a rule follower so please; mods, remove this if it is inappropriate. No hard feelings on my end.

This is me putting on my book reader hat and my web developer hat. I work full time as a web developer, as well as spend the majority of my life online. My wife jokes that i live on the internet and take vacations to reality. I hate most forms of social media; reddit being the exception, but i've used Goodreads too. I think goodreads is a terrible book platform. Every book has the same rating, hovering between 3 and 4 stars, so the ratings are pointless. Reviews for books pop up before its ever even been published. So i gave up on gr and have been on r/books for my book related social media and discovering of content. 

But i had a thought a while back about why reddit sucks for music (I'm also a musician; or at least was when i was younger) and its because the model itself is a feedback loop of popularity. Even the subreddits dedicated to showing people new music don't do that, because music that is truly new and unheard of doesn't get mass upvotes and music that everyone is familiar with gets upvotes because ""Oh hey, i love that song.""

Well, this applies to books too. I've seen this sub complain about it as well. So I had an idea. Possibly a bad one, so i'm running it by you.

What if there was a book forum that, like Goodreads, organized content by ISBN, but rated books using a binary yes or no option, and each isbn listing had a discussion section where instead of just leaving a review, you could discuss books you've read or are reading. I'm envisioning the process being books that you have read are added to a ""read"" list and then your homepage will have a section with the most recent discussion posts from those books; no friends lists like in GR, just anonymous honest discussion, like reddit, and your content is curated by books youve read, not by who you've added as a friend. Honestly, imagine a reddit where each ISBN was its own subreddit and you subscribe to the sub when you've read the book. Everytime someone posts something new to the discussion, you would see that there are new discussions in a book you've read; whether or not you jump in and partake in the discussion is on you. Titles that are hotter, aka, the rate of new discussions questions added is higher, they can become trending, and your home page would show you both trending titles you have read plus regional and global trending titles. In addition to this, recommendations would be made based on algorithm where if you liked Book A (by giving it a thumbs up or whatever represents a positive binary choice) and people who also liked Book A liked Book B, Book B would earn a point towards being suggested to you. If you also liked book C, and 10 people who liked Book A and Book C also liked Book B, then book B earns even more points towards becoming a suggestion for you. If you Like A, C but didn't like D, and people who disliked D but enjoyed A and C, also disliked B, it would lose points... etc. etc. you get the point. 

To me, this addresses some of the main issues i have with both reddit and goodreads for book social platforms, but... i also don't know if its even necessary in the first place. I'm biased; i live online and only take breaks in reality, so of course i would use something like this, but n=1, and i'm an odd case at that. 

So yeah, tell me this is a bad idea so i don't spend any time on it. Or tell me you'd love it and maybe i'll have a new project. Thanks r/books",Third Times a Charm?,1588198021

1) is it right and probably obligatory to say that there's rape in the series if you reccomend it to someone

books,"Some of these are ""fun"", showcase that the author is better than what they're constraining themselves to, or have good concepts.

I just don't ""get"" the appeal. Inherently there's shoehorned ""mechanics"" exposition dumps that do nothing but pad out the word count. The majority of plots seem to be in the same vein as the Isekai and power fantasy genres. It reads like the enjoyment is to see the exploits and moves before they're used, but in a technical manual with more artificial stupidity from the characters.

If I want to read a book with a lot of material for avid D&amp;D players, Orconomics is the first thing that comes to mind. The ""mechanics"" of the RPGs is central to the entire worldbuilding, plot, characters, etc. There's a lot of nice references for people familiar with the inspirations, while not being completely off-putting either. Mistborn series is another good example. I don't care much for Sanderson's dialogue or characters, but I'll give him credit for being clever and fun with worldbuilding and ""mechanics"" of a setting.

The LitRPG genre feels like a distillation of the wrong aspects. It kind of reads like an alien tried to connect people liking CRPGs to liking books while completely missing the point of what people like in either.

books,"I generally read informational books about things like human history or social sciences, but Blake Crouch is one hell of a fiction writer.

I was so taken aback by the realistic portrayals of traveling through time by memory. It feels so real and possible I found myself feeling close to the characters and storyline. I wanted to believe this wasn't my first time in this timeline

I loved the fullness of the story and solid ending. The writer really put thought into how to bring everything full circle. 

The way that the book ties up everything actually left me feeling very satiated and happy. It makes me realize books will always be superior to movies for their ability to be full of nuance and descriptions of things you could only ever see in the minds eye.

The virtual world was called something along the lines of web, net, thread, or cloth.

Me no good with words so maybe you didn't understand what I meant, so I'll try to give an example. Character X and Y are competing for a position. There's various schemes going on, and eventually character X thinks he tricked Y yada yada ... But, it turns out Y tricked X all along, because this whole thing was a distraction to make X forget about a crucial thing and thus making him the competition. 

So, in this case for example, the whole plot relies on distraction and character X forgetting something. And I've seen several books use this kind of thing. But there's just so many other things that could have happened. What if X wasn't distracted, what somebody else reminded X of that crucial thing etc...

books,"There is no better question to ask than, “When and what is the Sabbath?”

The Sabbath, if not carefully and prayerfully studied, can be one of the most confusing subjects. There is clearly a Sabbath that the God of the Bible made for His assembly, but with His voice of commandment being a Judge on all things, why are there yet various sabbaths differing from the one He set?

There is a reason why, on the seventh day of every week, the God of the Bible would have our faith know His “rest.” In the book, The Bible Sabbath, the reader will venture into the ever-lasting nature of the seventh day’s refreshing, examining, through the Bible’s philosophy, the reason for that Sabbath’s ever-lasting establishment. The reader will therefore, as they pass through this introduction on the Bible’s Sabbath, understand why they are given this appointment, and why the service held to it is so necessary for their mental and spiritual well-being.",A book about the real deal behind the true sabbath,1588182754

books,"Hello fellow Redditors, I need your assistance. So recently, I've been writing a self-help book on the topic on how motivation hardly gets people anywhere anymore, becuase, in this day and age, people are expecting quicker results from less work. I will tie this into the idea of how people are too indulged in what can satisfy them in the present, rather than the future. Now my question is, would there be anyone interested in reading this, and if so, what age range? I'm wondering how I need to format such a book and who I need it to appeal to.
Thank you for your time!

Reason number one, it's a parallel to Homer's The Odyssey set in the modern world. Of Ireland. Reason number two, everyone that I've heard or seen talking about this book and on a YouTube video, says this book is the most difficult in literature. I've read many books before, Stephen King's IT, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, Schilder's List, Diary of a Young girl, Dracula, etc. But none have come to this before.

books,"I am a moderate Stephen King fan and have read maybe 5 of his books over the years. I’ve had a copy of “The Stand” on my shelf for years and had the macabre desire to read it while Uber quarantine. I was always a little intimidated by the size of it and was never sure I would be able to cope with 1500 pages of Stephen King. I’m about halfway through and I have to say I think this is Kings best writing. And I mean specifically the writing, his prose is just so on point in this book. He balances detail, imagery, character development and action perfectly in this book. It is possibly the best paced novel I’ve ever read. Somehow he has kept me hooked page after page. There is also an elegance to his writing that seems to be missing from some of his other book. There’s a sense of confidence like he really knows what he’s trying to say in this one and isn’t meandering or redundant. The plot so far is also fully fledged we’ve met many of the characters and have the foreshadowing that all their lives will be intertwined at some point in the future. So far I can’t recommend the stand enough, I would consider it Stephen Kings best out of the ones I’ve read of his and I’m only halfway.",A mid review of The Stand by Stephen King.,1588177842

I read The Bell Jar and loved it. I also really liked Norwegian Wood by Murakami. I'm just fascinated about the different perspectives on reality that these illnesses bring.

books,"Hello,

For quite some time now, I've had this idea of founding a community that is focused around books. There isn't that many in my home country and I definitely think there is a demand for that. No one has just gotten around to make one. Initially I thought it would be great to host this meetup physically somewhere, but Covid-19 has forced this potential community to take an online form. Nevertheless, I'd be really interested to hear what book has moved you this year? It could be fiction or nonfiction. I am on the lookout for some books that could be discussed with a group of people. The only small prerequisite that I'd mention is that, the book should be easily accessible, meaning that one would be able to find it in a book store or buy as an e-book.

books,"After rereading with pleasure *Interview with the Vampire*, Anne Rice's novel that modernized the vampire myth in the last quarter of the twentieth century, I was very eager to read the following novels from the American writer's vampire saga. So I read the second novel in the series : **The Vampire Lestat**.

After following the adventures of Louis, the almost humanist vampire in the first novel, we have a new narrator in this second one : Anne Rice offers us the point of view of Lestat, Louis' ""vampire progenitor"".

The novel begins in 1984, when Lestat begins a rock-star career and is about to publish his autobiography. It is the text of this autobiography that makes up the bulk of the novel.

It's rather interesting to read about Lestat telling us his destiny, from his mortal youth at the end of the 18th century to his crazy project of revealing the existence of vampires through his career as a vampire-rock star in the mid-1980s.

Seen from the inside, we discover a very different character from the unsympathetic, cruel and disillusioned vampire who poisoned Louis' life in *Interview with the Vampire*. It's an interesting counterpoint, which sheds new light on several elements of the first novel.

However, the story suffers from some lengths in the middle ; after a while I wondered where the author wanted to take us. Fortunately, the revelations end up succeeding each other and the pace even accelerates frankly in the last part.

You have to understand that we are almost dealing here with a tale of stories : as Lestat's story unfolds, he meets ancestral vampires who tell him about their mortal and immortal lives, so we go back in time, as if we were leafing through a History of Vampires, to the origins of these creatures of the shadows. The story does indeed go back a long way in time, and that's the part I liked best in the novel.

The ending ends with a cliffhanger that promises action and probably more revelations in the next novel : The Queen of the Damned, which I should read soon.

the book was very dark, creating a feeling of claustrophobia and dread. i dont remember much of the plot points as it was a very non-traditional format and style. 

there were blank pages (intentionally), words trailing all over the page creating a sense of mental dread and paranoia.

it was written by a male author in the last 10-20 years and i think the cover was dark. i seem to remember an undercurrent of mental breakdown in the book involving a believe that their bodily fluids were a poison.
