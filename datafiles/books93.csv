books,"So, I'm a 27 year old man, but I seem to get fairly worked up about typos and other printing errors. They take me right out of a narrative and, worse, they make me feel as though I'm reading some cheap knock-off. I seem to crave officiality. I don't know what the psychology is behind it, but I get almost flustered by these errors, as if they've ruined my experience of the book. As if I can't get the 'wholeness' back, the feeling of a proper product, a curated experience. I try to read on, but I always think about the added word or the misspelled word. What's worse is errors for book illustrations. I've just been reading Alfred Kubins' The Other Side, a book that has many illustrations. I turned to one page and at the bottom was a black blob. I knew that something was wrong because it was jagged and pixellated. I  downloaded a free version of this old book and, well, there it is-- a sketch of a lady. I bought a book by a proper publisher and the free version was better. Why am I getting printing errors on the scale of whole illustrations? This is honestly infuriating. I have trouble getting past this. It feels like the whole aesthetic experience of the book I read. I think most people would shrug it off and keep on reading? Me? No. Can anyone relate or tell me how these things happen? I'm a writer myself, so I know how common typos are, but sketches is another matter.

&amp;#x200B;

'Children of Time' reminded me of a couple of books and movies, like 'Arrival', 'Pandorum', 'The Forever War' and even 'Spin' or '2001: A Space Odyseey' (a little). The play with time and perspective was really refreshing. The science was also not too bad and didn't require too much suspension of disbelief.

Reading had become an unenjoyable chore. So I stopped reading entirely. Then one day I came across a trailer forNeil Gaiman's The Sandman audiobook adaptation on YouTube. Having already read the entire comic series I was intrigued and wanted to listen to it. So, I joined audible and listened to the book during the trial period and I actually enjoyed it. It was a dramatic narration with multiple Hollywood voice actors and excellent sound effects. I had 2 more free credits left and I bought Cixuan Li's 3 Body Problem. I'm a huge achieve fiction fan.I really felt comfortable listening to the book and slowly reading kind of became fun again. Now I'm listening to more and more audiobooks. I find that fiction is better suited for the audiobook medium. Most recently, I listened to the Dune trilogy and thoroughly enjoyed it.

books,"My New Years resolution this year was to read more. I landed on the goal of reading 12 books in 2021 and to my surprise I completely crushed it. My love of reading has been rekindled thanks to this sub and others like it. Erin Morgenstern kicked off my year with “The Starless Sea” and I was absolutely infatuated with the story and her writing. Shortly after i read Madeline Miller’s “Circe” and was again blown away. I followed that up with The Winternight Trilogy by Katherine Arden and fell in love with the world she created in those three books. The sixth book was “And then there were none” by renowned author Agatha Christie and immediately saw why she was so well regarded. Coming in at number 7 was a book that was long overdue my attention, “The Fellowship of the Ring”. I grew up watching those movies every weekend, but there is something about Tolkien’s writing that almost feels religious. His writing paired with the beloved story I already knew created on of the best reading experiences of my life. Numbers 8-12 have felt like a strange fever dream, to think I had never heard of Discworld up until a few weeks ago is nothing short of a damn shame. Terry Pratchett has changed the way I think about literature, I know that sounds a bit over the top but it’s true. His style of comedy mixed with the philosophical ideas he puts forward come together to create something... magical. 

I have met my goal and I feel great about it, but what feels even better is knowing that I’ve found an old friend in reading. Thank you to this sub and others like it for contributing largely to my success.

books,"I am not planning on delving into the depths of the novel Stoner by John Williams; in fact, finishing it just an hour ago followed by laying in my bed thinking of the work has left me rather weary. But I have a certain thought that I must relieve: Stoner by John Williams is a masterpiece. A novel spanning the lifespan of a farmer turned to scholar, Stoner's life--at least from the perspective of those with a relatively impersonal relationship to the man--is an unremarkable one. But, like what I imagine being on the verge of death for a long period of time is like, this book hits you with a certain realism; a familiar and introspective one that allows one to delve into the intricacies and emotions of life and all it lacks and pains and the little slivers of satisfaction it occasionally has to offer. And, (I say this without reference to specific moments as I'd like this to be spoiler-free,) this introspection is accompanied by a lingering sorrow that I cannot image not pressing into me for years to come; perhaps as I grow and develop/lose relationships, feel slight and immense emotions, and learn and experience the dread and spectacles life has in store, this novel will always be stuck to the back of my head, forever present, always drawing me back to the depth and brutal introspection of the human experience. For some, it may not; it may dissipate in the mind as Stoner likely did to those who knew him. But, for the majority of readers, I am certain that it will have a profound and unshakeable effect on how they perceive the world--at least for just a moment where all that exists is the book in their hands and their mind working at a slow, reflective pace.",Stoner by John Williams: A Masterpiece,1617987307

After a lull for a few years, I started reaching again and probably get through 1-3 books a month. I was curious if Swan Song would hold up as an adult who’s read a lot more books, and holy hell it did.

books,"It is an amazing novel, with exceptional world building, and is beautifully written. I loved reading it. However, I despise Orwell’s commentary on humanity. The biggest issue I have is Winston being the “protagonist” and being seen as an Everyman character when he is actually far below the standard of an average man. I think it’s actually an insult that we’re supposed to identify with him because he’s so garbage.

An Everyman is a character that the audience is supposed to identify with based on their personality, thoughts or actions. Typically, they are quite average and unremarkable in appearance, have basic empathy, are humble, etc. Winston is described as being extremely below average, ugly yet full of pride, we’re supposed to pity him and yet he is grossly selfish. 

Now, for this type of genre, of course an average character would be affected by the world they are in. For Winston, he is supposed to be a broken man in a broken society. What doesn’t work is his ability to disregard the fear he is ruled by, only when it benefits him, while still falling victim to it so easily. His mental state is often justified by the trauma of living in fear. For example, he fears Julia is a spy and so the novel uses that fear to justify his thoughts about raping her and beating her head into cobblestone (which isn’t normal or excusable anyway) but these thoughts are not fear driven. Rape is not an action driven by fear. It also is not attributed to repressed sexual desire because when Winston first hooks up with Julia he literally states that he doesn’t feel anything other than pride. 
Also, sex with Katherine is literally the worst thing to him and he doesn’t like that he had to have sex with her. We are supposed to feel sympathy for him being forced to have sex with Katherine but excuse him wanting to rape Julia. He doesn’t have the moral compass an Everyman should have. While this can be argued to be the result of his environment, his role in the novel does not make sense because of this.

If he were so utterly afraid and broken, he wouldn’t do any of the things he does in the novel. This is why he fails as a protagonist, why he could never be a true Everyman on a hero’s journey, and why society is doomed at the end. The role he is given does not fit his character. Everything he does is for himself, not for a cause, not out of love. He is purely selfish and narcissistic. Yet, somehow he is able to disregard the fear he is so ruled by, so broken because of, to meet with Julia, but betrays her at the threat of pain. He really had no reason to ever even think he could go up against Big Brother. He also never loved Julia, there’s literally no reason for the two of them to like each other, so of course they betrayed each other. Julia doesn’t have a reason to be attracted to him, he is physically unappealing and you can say “it’s not about looks” but the whole reason he likes Julia is because she is young and beautiful. When she becomes unappealing to him, he discards her. And since Winston isn’t attractive, why would she love him using that same logic? Also his personality isn’t good either. It is less that Big Brother is so powerful and more so that the characters are incompetent. Humans have been proven to be capable of rebellion and revolution, withstanding torture to save the lives of comrades or loved ones. But I don’t think Orwell himself had a decent outlook on humanity when he wrote the novel. He was in a dark place and so, in his hopelessness, he wrote a book about a hopeless world. 

Of course, this is my opinion. Feel free to tell me yours. I simply can’t imagine identifying with Winston.",1984 Unpopular Opinion: Winston is not a true “everyman”,1617983193

books,"Today I finished reading this book, which I thought was really good. *The Farm* is about a facility called Golden Oaks Farm, where young women (usually poor immigrants) come to carry surrogate pregnancies for the uber rich.


The book explores how the opportunities available to people depend on both their race and their class/wealth. It also explores the ethics of surrogacy, and weather it is necessarily exploitative. The book is told from the alternating perspectives of four female characters, who see the world differently and who all have their own flaws. This book is not a thriller, but has some mild twists to keep you hooked.


The author, Joanne Ramos, is an immigrant from the Philippines, and this may have helped her to write the Filipina characters with sympathy and authenticity.


I saw several negative reviews of this book where people appeared to be dissapointed that it was not a grim dystopia in a similar vein to *The Handmaid's Tale*. But this book is nothing like Handmaid and should not really have been compared to it. Don't expect anything too sinister if you read it.


I enjoyed this book a lot, and thought it was both well written and easy to read. I am particularly interested in books with the theme of motherhood, which is why I chose this book.

I'm a teen myself (16 year old) so it would be interesting if they are teens in the story line. For example just a high school or university who take drugs, have sex, commit crimes and has a certain good storyline..

The only non-fiction I seem to find are memoirs, which are completely valid. I just prefer to read something more academic, and memoirs contain a level of emotion that can be particularly polarizing given the content.

A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many ""suggest some books"" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right 

**The Rules**

* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

**How to get the best recommendations**

The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

books,"This is just something funny I realized yesterday when I went to my local Goodwill. I came across 3 Twilight books and realized that not only did I always see Twilight books at every thrift shop I go to, but they were always the same ones: Twilight, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn (rarely ever see New Moon for some reason). Personally I‘m not really into the Twilight series anymore (middle school me would be screaming if she heard me say that) so instead of buying them I just kind of see them as a game. Everytime I go to a new thrift shop I search for them like “alright, where are you now?” And I always find one.

So yeah.... that’s what I was thinking about today. If you also shop for books at thrift shops, are there any other books you always find there (The Fault in Our Stars is another book that seems to make a regular appearance)?",Have you ever noticed that there is always at least one Twilight book in every thrift shop book section?,1617961986
