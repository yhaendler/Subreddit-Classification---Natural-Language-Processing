But now I’m a bit bummed on the curriculum in the bootcamp, (too easy), and very unsure what to do. I still have a bit time to withdraw from the program. 

Given the current economic condition, I can’t imagine an employer wanting to hire someone from a bootcamp vs a grad from full time masters/PhD or someone more experienced. 

The only thing I can kind of get out is their network but they also told us to cold email people. So seems like there isn’t a network?

datascience,"Hello guys,

I'm starting to look for a **PART-TIME** job in Vienna (Austria) as Data Scientist / Data Analyst / Machine learning engineer from \~1.10.2020 and I would like to get some insights and advices from other people before I start sending applications and CVs.

Something about me - I'm 24 y.o., I have bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Czech Technical University in Prague and I'm currently doing my master's (data science) at TU Wien.

I have 1 year of experience as PL/SQL Developer (part-time) and 2 years of experience as Data Analyst (full-time) in Prague. I also had half year long internship at University as data specialist.

My top skills are SQL, Python, R and relational databases. I've mostly work on reporting, analytics, process automation, query optimization, ad targeting and ML models in banking sector.

I quit my last job few months ago due to moving from Prague to Vienna  (also some trouble with COVID19) and decided to have free summer after years to catch up with friends and family. 

During my free time I also try to catch up by doing courses on LinkedIn,Data Camp and Coursera to avoid falling behind.

I'm mostly looking for job opportunities (both part-time and full-time) on LinkedIn, but there are not many of them (compared to Prague) and there are dozens of applicants in the first few days, which scares me a little. I also searched for companies I would like to work for, for example Raiffeisen bank, but they have only few part-time positions for freshmen with zero work experience and they pay \~1900euro brutto (for full-time), which is not acceptable for me.

So my question is, what am I doing wrong? Should I just send my CV and desired position with some technical information (that I want part-time etc) to companies I would like to work and wait for their response? Or should I get lost among other Linkedin Candidates? 

Thank you very much for every advice!",Data scientist job in Vienna,1596144927

Just wanted to thank you all for you help and questions, this group has been invaluable for me studying for interviews. Over the last month, I have been interviewing around at various companies and in the last couple days have received two offers. I don’t know exactly what “market rate” is for data science, so I was hoping for some help evaluating the better offer as I may have to make a decision on this while still in the pipeline at other companies so it’s unlikely I can wait to see if I get more offers or what they would be. 

This role is remote (I’m currently based in Dallas and company is not but they don’t mind where I work).

The offer is 160k base, 15% annual bonus, 5.5k annually towards tuition (I’m working on my MS part time with Georgia Tech OMAnalytics), 6% 1:1 401k match, 4 weeks vacation, 2 weeks worth of company holidays.

As far as my background, I have 4 YOE and have a dual BS in Math &amp; Econ, like I mentioned also currently part time enrolled in the Georgia Tech online masters. 

The team and would be manager seem awesome. I really clicked with the manager and it seems like the company cares and that they’re genuinely good people. 

As far as cost of living, I could stay in Dallas, which is definitely lower than the Bay Area or NYC. 

I’m in the pipeline at other companies, but is this offer worth taking and dropping out of the running elsewhere? I suppose I could take it and continue interviewing, but I really would like to avoid that because I did have a strong connection and wouldn’t want to leave them high and dry.

datascience,"Some of the most important kinds of information for data science are encoded in graphs. Organizational information, transactional information, hierarchical information, knowledge graphs.

The math of characterizing and working with graphs is well documented and understood, but as far as I can tell, not well implemented in data science tools.

The problem seems to be memory explosions as low-level engines sequentially calculate Cartesian products of every possible relation and then filter for the specific types of relations you happen to be looking for. Do this over more than a few hops and you'll bring any small or medium sized system to its knees.

This problem has obviously been solved by people who work with truly big graphs (Google and Facebook and friends), but I suspect that at least some of the time they are doing it simply with brute force, and anything more clever than this they keep proprietary.

This matters because you can actually represent graph information as a matrix, and  (some) matrix manipulations are extremely well implemented with open source software and accelerated by GPU hardware. You still have a risk of a memory explosion for dense graphs, but you've got built-in ways to serialize these kinds of calculations so that you're just slowing down, not crashing. 

The most important bit is that real-world graphs are more often than not sparse matrices. Sparse matrices can be serialized with a triplet structure, that is extremely efficient. There are both R and Python implementations of this available.

It should be possible to write wrapper functions that can take graph data structures as Node set, Edge set and transform them efficiently to sparse matrix triplets. It should also be possible to implement the most common graph algorithms to work as matrix operations in a way that is suitable for GPU acceleration. 

If anyone knows if this has already been done in open source, please let me know. 

I've been thinking about this for awhile and wanted to post these observations someplace public before I get too deep building stuff on them.","Graphs as matrices, matrices as triplets",1596130593

datascience,"I grew up in a privileged area with a very small class of high achievers. Most of my friends and classmates are successful now. Although I had high understanding of, and test scores in, history, literature, etc., I was always in the middle or back of the pack when it came to math.

Since developing my career, I have been getting more and more exposed to statistics and data. I am able to grasp programming concepts and SQL, and am able to understand database schemas/structures fairly well. However, when it comes to even basic statistics (regression, for example), I just seem to shut down.

When I see formulas or equations that contain letters, I don't know how to explain it, but I just get a complete mental block. If you give me percentages, fractions, proportions, even geometry, I am able to quickly work out solutions - normally faster than the average colleague that I work with. However, I just shut down as soon as I see letters or symbols or Greek letters in a formula. I can't seem to keep track of all the universal variables or assigned variables, and I quickly lose track of the logic in whatever formula or problem I'm working on.

I did learn early on in life that I was much better at ""word problems"" than I was at strict formulas, as I was able to understand the logic in the problem and translate it to a formula a bit more easily than just looking at a formula.

Anyway, I work on a dual project manager/insights role in a healthcare marketing department, adjacent to an advanced analytics team and a team of developers. The more I develop my career, the more this ""mental block"" seems to hinder me. I was hoping this community might have some suggestions or resources I could ingest/read/watch that could help me overcome this block so that I can have a better understanding of statistics and data science.",Help with overcomimg my mental block upon seeing advanced formulas so that I can learn more about statistics and data?,1596022731

datascience,"Do you have any good sources for software engineering with python, possibly, but not necessarily, focused on data science?

For some background. Majority of those ""python for data science"" tutorials or books, cover a pretty narrow area, which is ""python packages useful for data science"". This does not, however, even touch the essence of programming flow with python. Over the years in the industry, I've gathered a partial knowledge about that, but I'm looking forward to systemizing it and of course learning some better practices that I might have not been aware of. So I am looking for some well written piece of applied software engineering tips for python, that would for instance cover stuff like:

* ""good"" programming practices (for projects too complicated for Jupyter Notebook),
* managing dependencies, isolating environments etc.
* gitflow,
* testing,
* useful tools like pylint.

.. and so on. Pretty much all sort of stuff considered ""proper software engineering"".

I've looked at poisson regression, but are the mailers independent? Is meeting this assumption that important in industry?

datascience,"I have worked in a few finance companies now in the UK where the model-building framework tends to have a few common characteristics. 

For example:

* Logistic and linear regression are almost always used
* In classification, features are manually binned and replaced by their WOE (basically impact-encoding is used for all features)
* Variable selection: removing correlated features -&gt; filter method to exclude some features -&gt; stepwise feature selection, with strict p-value-based criteria for features entering/leaving the model
* The final model rarely has more than 10 features (selected from a pool of 200-300)

These practices seem \*very\* common in finance talking to more experienced people on my team. My manager is very open to modernizing and increasing the flexibility of our approach, but based on conversations i've had with senior managers and directors they tend to be more skeptical.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if we were suggest implemeting a non-linear/ensemble approach (e.g. lightgbm/xgboost/random forest) with 100 features, common concerns might be:

1. \*\*Model stability\*\* - Flexible models with many features produce 'less-stable predictions'
2. \*\*Model deterioration\*\* - Flexible models with many features may perform better initially but will degrade in performance much faster and require re-training/re-development more frequently
3. \*\*Model diagnosis\*\* - If something goes wrong, it's harder to figure out why
4. \*\*Interpretability\*\* - There is a real trade-off between performance and parsimony, and that a simpler method is worth sacrificing (sometimes considerable) cross-validation/test/future data accuracy

I personally haven't seen evidence to support 1, 2 &amp; 4. It particularly makes very little sense when we might include externally sourced features in our 'simple model' that are outputs of another predictive model, so these 'individual features' aren't so simple and are basically a function of 300 others! I think that 3 is a more legitimate concern, but that approaches like SHAP or simply monitoring changes in features over time could help with this.

I am not a big paper-reader but a lot of \[Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures\]([https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf\_1/euclid.ss/1009213726](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009213726)) resonated with things I have seen in industry. I suspect that many of these concerns and best practices probably originate from a mixture of best practices from explanatory statistics and tradition from credit risk modeling. I also think that a certain amount of it might be hearsay or a fear of the unknown.

&amp;#x200B;

Having said that, these directors have decades of practical modeling experience combined (most of it follows this classical credit-risk/banking framework) and are very intelligent and knowledgeable. On the other hand, I am in the first few years of my career and am still learning all the time. 

I am curious if there has been much research on this topic, if you guys have found (in your experience) any/all of these concerns to be legitimate, and how you might approach alleviating them if they aren't. Thanks!",The fear (in industry) of complex models with many features,1596016619

datascience,"Where do I start... (Short version: Do you know the best StatsIQ alternatives, I cant find a platform that does what they do?)

1 - I have been tasked with researching a data platform that will cut the time it takes to find insights. My company wants to implement this new platform (and we don't know jack about data management tools for non-data scientist)

2- You must know I am the ""Data Guy"" BUT I am NOT a data guy. I know how to use pivot tables in excel, that's it.  This task has sent me down the wonderful world of data tools and all the different platforms that have a use for very different things, each with its own terminology. 

3- I can't figure out what I am supposed to look for (BI, AI, Data Staging, Data visualizer, etc). I have spent HOURS with vendors and demos only to find out their product is not what I'm looking for (Tableau, Looker, Aleryx, Cicion)

Can any of you guys help a non-data scientist get some direction???

What I do:  I collect CRM and Survey data from our clients.  I cut this data with excel. I manually look for variables (ex. Revenue and State) to create a pretty chart (ex. TX has highest revenue).  I do this with 10 to 50 variables, depending on the CRM data and manually select variables that I think may give some insight. 

I create a story out of the ""insights"", I take about 40-60 hours to create 5 to 10 charts. Many times ""TX has the highest revenue"" is not really an insight as the Client already knows this but it still took me time to compare the two variables, look at the information and determine that TX had the highest revenue. 

Is there a platform that will cut the time it takes for me to do this? A terminology I should be looking for?

The challenge is that this process is only done ONCE, we do not update the info after the first data cuts. Each CRM and Survey is different as we only do it once for each client, so new data set every time.

Hint: Qualtrics StatsIQ does a good job at spitting out analysis back without much effort on my part. It will automatically correlate all the variables you select and identify which variables need a closer look for insights.

datascience,"Hi everyone, I'm an undergrad pursuing a degree in Molecular Biology. I've been doing research under a professor which involves handling a large data set of neurons which really sparked my interest in data science. After some consideration, I've decided to pursue a career in data science and I would love to know any tips, especially from people who went through the same transition as I have.

A few concerns I have had are below:

- Would my degree (B.S. Molecular Science, Minor in Biomedical Research) be a big deterrent for recruiters? I have done some coding classes, but most of what I know are self taught. Also, I am way too late in my degree to change majors or add minors.
- I love doing doing side projects, are these enough to show my proficiency in the languages (R, Python)? Additionally, would non-Data Science projects show any good traits? I love making things that I could use, so things like Chrome Extensions which are more Javascript/HTML based.
- When I took my intro R class, I  realised that while I know how to do a lot of stuff, I didn't know much about data types and such. Once I learnt those things, I felt like my understanding was elevated. Would courses from places like DataCamp be helpful for me to receive similar enlightenment?

datascience,"Booz Allen Hamilton is a legitimate company, but I believe someone is posing as them to scam job seekers.

This morning, I got an email for a remote Data Scientist position with BAH. The job description sounded legitimate and it said ""We successfully reviewed your resume and it has been approved for an virtual screening test/interview by Booz Allen Hamilton Inc, for the position of ***Data Scientist*** (REMOTE)."" They also asked me to confirm my name and city listed on my resume, which I thought was strange, but not out of the realm of possibility. The person listed to contact has a LinkedIn profile with 300 connections and is listed as a BAH employee.

I said I was interested in the interview and that I had availability tomorrow. A few hours later, they emailed me with the screening test and let me know I had three hours to complete it. Kind of a dick move, but okay. It consisted of mostly technical questions related to machine learning algorithms.

I sent my answers back to them and received a reply stating they had gotten my answers, would ""forward the \[answers\] to the Hiring Board for their decision,"" and would get back to me with ""feedback from the Board's decision in about an hour or more."" I did not reply. At this point, there were a few warning signs, but nothing overtly obvious that this was a scam.

30 minutes later, I received another email stating that ""I am glad to inform you that due to your level of experience and your working skills, the company has decided to hire you as one of our ***Data Scientists.""***  They wanted my full name, address, email, and phone number for the HR hiring letter. They would also send me a check ""to set up your mini office by purchasing the office equipment and software needed to start your training and work."" They also said I would undergo a few days' training at $20 an hour and then work itself would be $60 an hour.

I was very suspicious at this point, and eventually found [this article](https://adage.com/article/agency-news/job-offer-agency-fake/314615) from two years ago detailing a scam with almost the same details but from a different company.
