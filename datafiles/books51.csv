I really enjoy collecting books. I like the cover art, the feeling of sitting on the couch and reading an actual piece of paper. We spend every waking moment staring at screens, and it feels great to take a break from that with a book. 

That being said, every time I buy a relatively long book, I end up wanting the audiobook and ebook anyway. I want the audiobook for the car, and the ebook for my computer and phone for basically any time I am away from my couch or bed. 

I've already spent $20 on the book, plus my $15/month Audible subscription (which I just can't give up even though I also use Overdrive/Libby, since many books that I read are always 8 weeks out or not on there at all).

I just feel like once the book has been purchased, we shouldn't have to spend $10-$15 on a 600kb ebook file.

books,"I don't just mean giving their characters a gruesome early death GRRM-style, but when the writer writes a character whose story could've been really interesting and then never bothers to develop it. (Usually dropping it in favor of a character who is really boring.)

I've always hated Madeline L'Engle for doing this to Zachary Gray in A Ring of Endless Light. For those who haven't read it: basically, it's about a teen girl choosing between 3 guys, he's one of the 3 guys. I empathized with him a lot because he spends the book being suicidal due to his rich-but-emotionally-neglectful family, having an entire town of wholesome salt-of-the-earth types hate him because one of theirs died trying to save his ""spoiled"" ass from a suicide attempt, and desperately latching onto the female lead because she's a nice girl from a loving family who is at first sympathetic to him. The author just presents him as a ""bad boy"" for the lead to be initially attracted to, but in the end righteously choose against. I mean, I'm not saying he necessarily should have ended as her boyfriend, but L'Engle could've  shown what happened to him instead of just completely dropping his story. Well, not completely: he shows up in a later book where he's not suicidal anymore (no reason given) but still a jerk the reader is supposed to hate. Because in a world where the main characters mostly come from good healthy families, let's all hate on the person who had a bad childhood and is emotionally damaged from it.

That being said: writers can also shortchange their characters by being too sympathetic to them. Jordan in Color Me In  by Natasha Diaz was this, I think. She's a dark-skinned black girl who is extremely ""woke"" and gives the biracial main character a hard time, in part because the guys around them are rejecting Jordan in favor of fetishizing the MC's light skin. You feel for her, because she really has suffered a lot due to racism, but she's also a master at using social justice jargon for personal social gain, the kind of person who will be trying to destroy lives left and right on social media for microagressions, if she isn't doing so already. In the hands of another, better writer, she would've been a fascinating sympathetic villain. Instead, by the end of the book she's presented as just having been right all along about everything. Too bad, because she could have been the most interesting character in the book.

books,"I'm not a part of this community or at least of yet, I enjoy books but I have a more solid enjoyment for writing (which can be a downside a lot of the time because I haven't broken up my time to read a lot).

But I was reading The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien, and I kind of got a little bit of a surprise when I noticed that they listed off what they carried a lot, and I saw that as an info dump quality.  But now that I see an ""info dump"" being projected in the first chapter of the popular story, I'm starting to question whether I know what an info dump actually is.

If ""Listing off what they carried"" perhaps is an info dump, then, in what would be my opinion, this dumping of information could be the strength of that chapter. But ultimately, I'm still starting to question if this was a use of writing power, or I have info dumps all wrong and lists aren't bad.

Briefly said: does the first chapter contain info dumps? Do I not know what an info dump is and it's actually normal to list out everything at once? Is it genius writing work that converts the downside into strength because they ""Carried"" it? Or is it something else entirely? I mean, ultimately it's the reader that converts this knowledge to what they know and such, but I really just want to know if I know what's going on here.

books,"Hello fellow book lovers,


Hello fellow book lovers,

As many of you have likely seen the PNW is under siege from the many wildland fires in the area. Each year the fires blaze through Oregon, California and Washington so this is not something unique to 2020. The circumstances that lead to this moment however are unique in that a  historic wind storm the likes of which hasn't been seen in over 50 years has ripped through the state causing downed trees and power lines and pushing the fires that are not contained even further into our communities.

My town is now under level 1 evacuation orders. This means it's time to prepare for the order to leave. It will be impossible to take everything with us, there just isn't enough room. I have a decent sized book collection (always wanting more!) and will have to choose only a few to take with me. My question is how do you choose? Which books would you take with you in the event of an evacuation such as this? 

Stay safe out there PNW buddies ❤",I'm deciding what books to take with me in the event of evacuation.,1599682438
books,"Hello,

Writers mostly count numbers of words because the pages size and the space between the lines affect the numbers of page needed to display those words. A 100'000 words novel will have more or less 300 pages in 12 time new roman, double space line.

As for Fantasy and Sci-Fi, the usual word count is about 150'000 or about 450 pages.

&amp;#x200B;

For the longest of time, paperback book were the only viable option and printing a 300'000 words book in 900 pages was out of the question or would have result in the book costing 50 USD. And not that many people are willing to try out a book from a random author with no back ground library and risk 50 USD to find either a good or bad book. It's not a good gamble.

But with Ebook, the numbers of pages doesn't increase price because they are pdf. So more pages doesn't mean higher price range. Many authors release as many books as they can to have more books to sell, but is it really a good thing story wise to split book into smaller one?

I'm a financial analyst and as a hobby, I've been writing medieval dark fantasy for about 4 years. I have a full book completed (750 pages, 250'000 words), I did the first full edit and passed it to my 3 beta readers to get feed back before editing it again. The book was well received, but, 2 out of 3 beta readers said that I should split it in 2 books instead of one to release them one after the other and have a better marketing for the release. 

Again, I don't write for money and it feels wrong to me to split it in half. 

&amp;#x200B;

Question : 

How would you react towards a book with 750+ pages for about 250'000 words from a complete stranger? Would the page numbers turn you away? 

Would you rather read many small books?","Readers of reddit, How does book format / page count affect your reading experience? Did Ebook change your view on it? Is 750 pages too much? Do you prefer many small books or fewer large book?",1599682143

books,"I have dozens of other things that I need to complete today, but I don't want to do those. I want to go on a brief rant to no one about *Gideon the Ninth*. I saw this book mentioned on various book sites and it was available at my library, so I figured I'd give it a go. Overall, I liked it and I will read the sequel, but I was annoyed by a few things.


**Book Blurbs**

These are always dumb and I know it is to get someone to read the synopsis in the hopes that they then buy it, to catch that someone will just see on the cover that ""George RR Martin says ‘This. Kicks. Ass.’"" and be like ""He wrote GoT!!!! Dope. I'll take 2."" I took special exception to some of the blurbs on *Gideon the Ninth* for some reason.

&gt; (on the front cover) ""Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space! Decadent nobles vie to serve the deathless Emperor! Skeletons!"" - Charles Stross. 

1.	First, everywhere I saw talk about this book, they mentioned lesbians. After reading the book, the sexual preferences of characters felt like an afterthought that did not have an impact on the plot. I think ""necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space"" is already pretty niche, and would get the book into the right hands. I want more lgbt friendly media and literature, especially in the sci-fi/fantasy genre, but they way the book was marketed (or at least what I saw of the marketing) feels cheap after reading the book. I don’t identify as lgbt. I would like to learn more about if this is a common thing with lgbt representation in media. Is this a healthy or helpful way for that representation to occur? I know there are better books to read if I am looking for lgbt representation, but I am wanting to learn what people think about this approach. Was it used as marketing or was it fair and representative?
2.	 Second, Decadent nobles makes me expect the vampire league from Twilight. I would not describe anything in this book as decadent. There was one dinner party that was described as a dinner my family would try to throw that has the intention of being something major, but really, it’s just my mother-in-law making the same meal she was going to make on Sunday regardless of whether my sister-in-law brought a fruit salad or not.
3.	Finally, ""Skeletons!"" Well, I was on the fence at this point Charles, but you really sold me with this note! Can you hear necromancers and not assume skeletons?


&gt; ""Goofy and gleaming; a profane Daria in space."" - Robin Sloan 

Daria would snark the ever-loving shit out of this book. I don't think so. 


&gt; ""This crackling, inventive, and riotous book from an original voice is a genuine pleasure. Also, the author is clearly insane."" - Warren Ellis

The first part is fine, but come on. That last bit is terrible.


&gt; ""Necromancers! Dueling! Mayhem! *Gideon the Ninth* is disturbing and delightful in equal measure"" - Yoon Ha Lee

""Dueling!"" well, shit. Combine this with the ""Skeletons!"" on the front and I'm surprised this didn't sell a billion copies. 

In summary, this book is ""goofy, crackling, inventive, gleaming, disturbing, and delightful and it's kind of like Daria, but with lesbians, skeletons, and dueling."" It is also written by ""an insane person."" WTF? Get your shit together and sort out what this is. They act like this is some completely undefinable book that couldn't be fathomed before it was written. Settle down, ToR.

**the book itself - just like 2 weird editing things**


* Page 378, at the end of the chapter a character says, ""We can't do anything for them. The living have to take precedence here, if we want to keep living."" Then the next line to end the chapter was, ""As it turned out, he was wrong."" I am not sure if this writing device has a name (where they kill any tension building by using Arrested Development narrator voice), but this was the first and only time I remember it appearing in the book. This book is like 450 pages long. Why introduce this 80% of the way through? It was really jarring.


* I don’t like characters that are the type that say or do provocative things just because, but I think the author did a good job with it here. The MC had a lot happen in their life and you could tell they had empathy in the right moments, so the provocative stuff was just a shield. This made it really frustrating when the MC ignored this and it felt like the attitude was used for a gag. 

    For example, a character dies and the MC is witness to it. When the MC goes to tell the deceased character’s partner, instead of the empathy coming through, or the character growing and being direct, the MC opts for a lame joke. Yes, the MC uses humor as a shield, but they didn’t need to here. It wasn’t set up for that. While it was a let down the MC opted for the joke, the most frustrating part is that it wasn’t reflected on or addressed at all. Everyone just moved on from it like it didn’t matter. It wasn’t a huge deal, but again, it took me out of the writing and the character where I had to pause and be like, “what the hell? Did I miss something?”

Again, I liked the book. I’ll pick up the sequel at some point. I just wanted to avoid working and this was more satisfying to do than my next real task.",A brief rant about Gideon the Ninth (90% about the book blurbs),1599679953

I downloaded the whole of Lovecraft Fiction, thinking I'm in for a treat.. and I gotta say that my impression of the first story - The Nameless City - is pretty low.


Firstly, the sentences have no flow at all and there is frequent repetition of the same words in nearby sentences (which is usually bad and indicative of poor vocabulary.). The whole thing is filled with fancy schmancy words (as a non-native speaker, I had to look up like 10 or so words) which, in contrast with the rest of the story, seems just like showing off. Same with mentioning random gods and historical figures. My showoff alarm is going off. Dude trying to be Plato or something. The two passages he ""cites"", are literal dogs_it, no offense. They don't rhyme, make no sense, and if there is any supposed rhythm being created, it is only by short'ng words heavily.



I seriously feel that I could write something like this with no problems. It's such bad quality. You solve they mystery a mile away, and the ending is just stupid. The beginning is full of filler, writing the same thing in 20 different ways, while completely failing at actually describing anything or creating a sense of mystery or curiosity in the reader.



So my question for you is whether I should bother with the rest of the stories? 


If they are not at least 500% better, then I think not. I have just come from reading Tolkien, and I don't wanna offend anybody, but what I have in The Nameless City is f-tier dogsh_t.

The greatest books are defined as classics for a reason. Written by the greatest literary minds of their time, they have universal themes, characters, experiences, emotions and perspectives that are still relevant today. Some of them are the very inspiration from which entire modern genres of literary fiction have sprung up from.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone should read at least once for these 30 books — some are well known classics, others are modern giants.  All are well worth reading at least once in your life!

## 1. To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee

&amp;#x200B;

Published in 1960, this timeless classic explores human behaviour and the collective conscience of The Deep South in the early 20th century. Humour entwines the delicate strands of prejudice, hatred, hypocrisy, love and innocence to create one of the best novels ever written.

## 2. 1984, by George Orwell

Although 1984 has passed us by, George Orwell’s dystopian, totalitarian world of control, fear and lies has never been more relevant. Delve into the life of Winston Smith as he struggles with his developing human nature in a world where individuality, freewill and love are forbidden.

## 3. Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, by J.K. Rowling

I’m willing to bet you’ve heard of Harry Potter, but have you read the books? Join Harry Potter as he begins his journey into the world of magic, where he is the celebrated Boy Who Lived. Visit Hogwarts, meet your favourite characters and watch Harry grow into the one of the most famous literary characters in the world.

## 4. The Lord of the Rings, by J.R.R. Tolkien

Middle Earth is a wonderful, expansive fantasy world filled with turmoil, heroes, evil and innocence. Although our protagonist Frodo Baggins’ quest seems impossible to complete, this trilogy is a tale of triumph in the most impossible circumstances.

## 5. The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald

Published in 1925, Fitzgerald’s *The Great Gatsby* explores the decadence of the Jazz Age, and one man’s introduction into a world where even those with the most indulgent lives cannot earn love.

## 6. Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen

One of the most famous novels of all time, Pride And Prejudice details the courtship of two opposed characters in a world where manners and courtesy are of the utmost importance.",6 Books Everyone Should Read At Least Once In Their Lives,1599674213

It seems like it constantly violates the rule of ""show, don't tell"" because it seems like every three paragraphs a character is doing an aside about how they feel about some person or treachery. As a result, the narrative style constantly reminds me of this iconic [Futurama scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBhR4QcBtE). Obviously it's not poorly written given its stature and acclaim, but I can't help but being taken aback by what seems like a constant violation of the ""show, don't tell"" rule.

The trailer for the new Dune adaptation has finally been released. Overall, I think it looks encouraging in the sense of graphics and settings. It really looks how I imagined Arrakis and the graphics look amazing, especially considering the graphics in the 1980s film. 

I do have some concerns of how it will live up to the novel in terms of casting. I know Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya are the new hit people in Hollywood, but are they the best for Paul and Chani? They also appear to be combining the characters of the beast Rabban and Feyd-Rautha, which I think is an odd decision.

It follows main character Nick Burke who's profession is questionable at best bordering on vigilante.  Along the way you get to see him go through internal struggles and climb mountainous fears in ways of love and intimacy.  Also you are introduced to the small crew that usually accompanies him on his oddball missions of justifying those who fell through the cracks which are a fun lot. 

Its has a few tie ins with GbA but they're all explained in the novel without the need to read the first.

books,"This is my first Murakami and I LOVED it. It's a 4/5 for me. I love his writing. I think it's very  cozy and elegant and atmospheric. Others described it as *dreamlike* or *dreamy* and I definitely agree on that. I was very immersed the whole time. I thought about it a lot after I finished reading. I kinda ""analyzed"" it and here are some of my thoughts:

- The story itself isnt that great but the writing is just so beautiful. This book left me with an unexplainable feeling and I love it when I get that from a book. 

- I totally understand other people who hate the characters. I think the characters are terrible people. Maybe because they are teenagers lol. They are very easy to hate. The MC is a terrible guy. Naoko as well. Nagasawa is a jerk. Midori is weird (but I love her). Reiko is okay until the last part. Stormtrooper is probably the best character.

- Midori is weird. But I really liked her. When I thought about it, her character is not really that likeable irl. If I meet a girl IRL that talks a lot about sexual stuff even if she has a boyfriend, I probably would stay away from her. But I LIKED Midori. It's weird. This is the first time I actually liked a character from a book. I was always looking forward to her scenes. A lot of times when she's not on the scene I find myself turning the pages to see how many pages before I 'see' her again. This is the first time I felt that on a fictional character. 

- I loved MC and Midori's relationship. I'm happy that they fell inlove with each other but I think it would be fine for me as well even if they just remained best friends and MC and Naoko ended up together.

- I wish Murakami thought of a better way of removing Stormtrooper from the story.

- I didnt hate Reiko until the last few pages. I would probably give this book a 5/5 but the last part threw it. The sex scene with Reiko is unnecessary imo. A lot of sex scenes are actually unnecessary but it's an erotic novel so yeah


I havent read a lot of good books. I only started reading as a hobby this quarantine. Maybe thats why I'm so inlove with this book even with its flaws and imperfections.

Oscar Wilde once said ""If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again, there is no use in reading it at all"". I am sure most of the readers would agree with Mr. Wilde. Unfortunately, in the recent times, books belonging to this special class have lost traction. Mentioned below are the top 5 top reasons why people reread certain books.

&amp;#x200B;

1. One of the most common reasons which many readers offer for their rereading affinity is powerful story. It not only beckons them to take another shot at the work but instantly drags them within the pages and transforms them into a participant. It is this virtue which coerces the reader time and again. This kind of literature usually finds its way into bibliophile's collection.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Earlier, especially in the 70's and early 80's few books were printed, and there were fewer authors. It was also difficult to buy books due to its unfriendly price tag. To overcome this hurdle, most readers built a mini library which was exploited innovatively. Owners of these personal libraries either exchanged literary works with friends and relatives or reread interesting ones. These private libraries flourished in every neighborhood. Interestingly, some of them transformed into commercial entities especially those which had a large collection of books.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Then there are readers who swear by God that every time they reread one of their cherished books they gained a newer insight into the author's writing style, story and characterization. Of course, most of them believe that it is age related thing. For example, some of classic literature which forms a part of school / college curriculum is way beyond the understanding young minds. However, a decade down the line, the same books depict a different tale. As one reader pointed out that it was all about a matured mindset which develops with age.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Empathetic and compelling character/s, especially those with whom we can easily relate to, and connect with is yet another common reason for rereading. It is this connection which draws readers to the book again and again, at times to fetch inspiration and at times to compliment the author for its outstanding characterization.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Dog eared books are like muses. They seduce readers and then allow them to recapture some of the chapters, scenes or passages of a novel. When a reader marks the page during the first read it simply means that this person will return one day. It is a signal that the particular part of the story has somehow made its way to the reader's heart. Incidentally, in these contemporary times most of the book lovers use bookmarks which somehow dilute the intensity, the passion with which the page was marked.

&amp;#x200B;

So, why do you reread if at all you do? And do you believe it is an unfair practice because these books are ""Gods of Literature"" and many new authors lose out a sale because of them.",Rereading Books - Reasons &amp; Benefits,1599665278

books,"I think objectively it was well written and I understand why other people might like it.  But I've read a lot of  post-apocalyptic fiction and for me there wasn't anything that made it special.  I think the hype might of ruined it for me.  I don't feel like reading it again.  If you didn't like it and you have read it recently could you explain to me why you didn't like it?  

Or if you did like it but feel that you have insight into why someone who reads a lot of books from the genre might not like it?

For myself I just remember feeling that it didn't stand out.  I remember thinking that people were reading this book that didn't normally read post-apocalyptic fiction and being blown away by a lot of things that are pretty well trodden territory for the long time fan.  I enjoyed The Road, A Canticle for Leibowitz, World War Z, The Girl with all the Gifts, and many countless books that are more action oriented and pulpy. 

I don't think that Station 11 is a bad book. It is a good book.  But I don't like it when it is held up as THE book to represent the genre.  I really don't like that.  I might however recommend the book to a someone who i wanted to dip their toes in and didn't want to overwhelm.

books,"*The Strange Case of Jekyll Hyde* is one of the most popular books representing split personalities and the conflicting moralities in every person, even though that's not what the book is about.

As many well know, Mr. Hyde is not a separate person or personality from Dr. Jekyll, it is but a mask for him to wear to indulge in his secret desires without fear of retribution from Victorian society.

Modern interpretations of the story have changed the narrative that Hyde is the physical and/or mental embodiment of Jekyll's id, an uncontrollable monster fueled by desire and emotion. These types are shown in movies like the League of Extraordinary gentlemen or any Looney Tunes cartoon.

The other popular variation is a mixture of the two former. A human being in shape, but a creature in actions. A differing personality to Jekyll, but closer to Jack the Ripper than the Incredible Hulk. Mild mannered Jekyll is taken over by the evil personality inside every man. An example of this is the criminally underrated Jekyll and Hyde musical.

What I want to ask is, what is your favorite variation? Either to read, watch, write, hear, anything.
