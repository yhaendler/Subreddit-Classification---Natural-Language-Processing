books,The infamous Gulag forced labor camps under the Soviet Union is carefully and meticulously detailed as to what occurred. And it was horrorifying to read that I needed to take breaks in between to settle my nerves. The author does a great job dividing the book into 7 sections (it's technically 3 volumes). Even before we get to camp we get the political discussions between Lenin and the purges of opposition and criminals who are gonna be forced laborers or slaves. Its a great book and reminder of the inevitable outcome of communist ideas,The Gulag Archipelago. Horrifying story,1616000879

books,"I just finished the book Amoralman by Derek DelGaudio. He has a special on Hulu called “In &amp; of Itself” which was a filmed version of a stage production he put on in NYC for a couple of years. It’s part story-telling, part magic show. It was extremely hyped, and I enjoyed it, but didn’t think it was “life-changing” like I saw some people online describe it. I figured I’d give his new book a shot, though, and enjoyed it immensely. It’s a memoir of how he got into magic and sleight of hand tricks and focuses a lot on his time as a cheating card dealer in an underground poker game. There was a lot of interesting information about the methods of those who cheat at gambling. It was well-written, very easy to breeze through (I finished it in less than 24 hours), and has an overarching metaphor relating to Plato’s Cave Allegory I thought was well-used. If you saw the Hulu special and found it remotely interesting, I definitely recommend checking out the book. If you’ve never heard of him or the special, I’d still recommend it for its fascinating insights into the world of shady poker players.",Amoralman by Derek DelGaudio,1616000278

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to voice my complaint about something.  After finding out Laura's real age in the first book, Little House in the Big Woods, which was 2 years old instead of the age she chose for the story, I was a very disappointed.  That means all of the conversations and words that Laura from the book talked was all made up.  A 2 year old does not have that kind of vocabulary lol.  All the talking she did with her family and what not, all made up.  Mary, Ma and Pa, if they weren't talking to Laura, maybe those were a little more accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, since actions can also be reactions to what we say,  a lot of the actions were made up too.  Example of what I mean by that (if you say, ""can you come here?""  that other person will walk to you)

On The Little House on the Prairie, that is a little more realistic, since real life Laura would have been 3 years old.  But if you want much more realism and less fiction, start with On the Banks of Plum Creek.  Her actual age would be 4.

&amp;#x200B;

Little House in the Big Woods is by the far the most fictional book of the series.  A pretty big let down once I found out about Laura's age between the book and her actual age.

&amp;#x200B;

""B-but I spent years learning literary theory""

Oh wow, you can use the word ""signifier"" five times in a sentence and tell me how everything is a penis metaphor? Impressive.

""B-but I have spent years analysing literature""

Yes, that's precisely the reason that a casual reader has a richer experience than you can ever expect to have, because you have spent four years of your precious life analysing three lines from a Rimbaud poem and how it relates to Heidegger's concept of ontico-ontology. Your overfocusing on these trivialities has led to you losing touch with the raw experience of art.

books,"Every time I think of this book, I immediately get transported to the mandatory economics class (Econ 101: Macroeconomics) I took in college. The professor opened the lecture with: “Most importantly, with this class you will understand how the world works.” At the time, I dismissed this statement by thinking that it was a mere exaggeration that every professor starts their lectures with— for example, physics is the basis of all sciences, religion is the basis of humanity, Spanish II is the basis of existence etc. However, I was pleasantly surprised with how much insight into how the world operates a basic understanding of economics can bring. After all, the science of economics was able to graph happiness and establish the “Law of Diminishing Return” which I considered to be deeply philosophical topics. As such, I gained a different perspective about the driving factors of sociological and psychological changes. There was only one problem: the class was extremely boring. Thus, it took me a while to get back to reading anything related to economics.

Years later, I crave reading something that talks about the ethical aspect of who should own the means of production. So, I pick up Karl Marx’s “Das Kapital.” And, just like with my macroeconomics class, I am pleasantly surprised with how much insight the book brings into how the world operates. Specifically, the book focuses on accumulation of wealth via exploitation of labor and presents the capitalist exploitation of labor as a machine of perpetual motion. In other words, “Das Kapital” present capitalism as a system that is able to expand indefinitely with its limitless ways of exploiting labor. Due to its effort to be insightful, however, “Das Kapital” is chaotically structured: philosophical insights intertwined with algebra/algebraic formulas and historical observations. As a result, such chaotic structure causes the book to lack in clarity. This shortcoming, however, should not deter anyone from reading “Das Kapital” due to its ability to critique a system that is dependent on complacency.",My Experience With Karl Marx’s “Das Kapital”,1615990504

However, given the hyper this book has received, specifically on this platform, I figured it's worthwhile posting some honest thoughts.


More than anything, *this book is overrated*, and *takes itself too seriously*.


I mean, there is a lot of **novelty** in the dramatization of only logical story, and it's obvious the author of gone to great lengths researching, applying her expertise, and overall delivering a solid book.


But to me, it felt too much like an *academic exercise* of somebody who is highly skilled in writing, I supposed to a book that is born out of intimate relationship with the characters. For instance, I did not find the first person narrative fitting. Also, I didn't like the ""mix &amp; match"" of commentary on war; criticism of Society; and the berating the way men behave since ancient times. Each of these elements on their own was good -- and I enjoyed them -- but this mixture created some misalignment and dissonance, an overall negative experience for me.
