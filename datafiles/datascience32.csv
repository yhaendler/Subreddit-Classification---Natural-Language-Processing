datascience,"Hello!

I'm a junior data scientist, been working in the field for about a year after getting a professional master in this topic.

I work for a small startup, which means that I have no mentor and I have to figure out shit on my own, as well as deal with everything that is data related (not just data science, but also engineering, ETL and what not).

It's fun and challenging, but also at times very frustrating, because I have this constant feeling of *never knowing enough,* and given the complexity and depth of this field, and the pace at which it develops, it is really overwhelming.

Also, coming from a business / economics background, my math and stats skills are not exactly razor sharp.  
I compensate by being a massive nerd, so I learn stuff quickly, but that's about it.

datascience,"I feel like whenever I see linear regression models, I rarely see them use anything other than first degree regressors. Is there a reason we don't use more 2nd or 3rd degree regressors? 

e.g. housing\_price = B1\*bathrooms + B2\*bathrooms\^2 + B3\*bedrooms 

Maybe this has just been my experience, I just feel like we're making a huge assumption that the relation is linear and not quadratic or what have you. Also, as a data scientist, would you just try a variable up to some degree and keep the significant terms, or should you have reason to believe there is a relationship of that degree before trying it?",Question: Why isn't there more linear regression with Nth degree polynomials?,1591313697
datascience,"Hi everyone. I know this is probably a really naive question, but I was wondering which topics in my introductory statistics course will be the most useful in data science.

I'm a materials engineering student focusing on materials informatics, and I'm looking to supplement my engineering degree with as much stats and CS as I can fit in. 

I'm taking an intro course in statistics aimed at scientists and engineers, and here are the topics we'll be covering:

* Descriptive statistics and basic visualization
* Probability theory
* Discrete random variables and probability distributions
* Continuous random variables and probability distributions
* Join probability distributions and random samples
* Point estimation

datascience,"Hi guys, just some background before my main question: 



This summer I decided that software development is not for me and decided to pursue data science instead and fell in love with it. I'm currently an undergraduate student pursuing a major in Computer Science with a focus on AI and a minor in Statistics as well as a certificate from my school in Data Analytics. I tried to pick my major and minor to cover as many of the important skills in data science as possible on top of pursuing one of the optional yet relevant certificates offered by my school. I am also pursuing a couple MOOCs to teach me what I need to start developing a portfolio to hopefully secure an internship next summer (my internship this summer is as a backend web developer which is not directly useful).



Now, since I am entering my third semester I think now is a good time to start planning for my graduate degree. I recently spoke to an academic adviser about this and they were suggesting that I pursue one of the master's options from my school (understandably) in Computer Science. Specifically of interest was the research based program for Artificial Intelligence. However, the school also offers a course based Master's in Management Analytics which seems like it would give me me many of the data skills I am looking for as well as provide some business knowledge that I am lacking in my current degree. 



These options are obviously from my school only and I am more than willing to go elsewhere for my graduate studies but I had some questions with regards to my options.

* Should I prefer a research-based, project-based, or course-based master's? My biggest concern with research based would be coming up with an idea for my thesis. Are Master's students expected to develop their own proposal or will I typically be working with a professor to come up with an idea?

* What field would be best to get my master's in? Specifically considering my undergraduate degree (CS major, Stats minor) would it be best to pursue another CS master's or should I pursue something from Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science or anything else? It seems like Data Science would be an obvious choice but I'm from Canada and I don't have too many options with regards to Data Science programs.",What type of Master's degree should I pursue?,1591304966

&amp;#x200B;

1. **""Data scientist"" is turning into a blanket term. So is ""data analyst"".** So many of the jobs I've looked at truly want a data engineer/DBA but ask for a data scientist. Or want a data scientist but ask for an entry level data analyst. Expand your search terms, but read the job description to figure out what the company really wants. This changes every time I'm on the job market even in my short tenure as a data scientist. When did ""Machine Learning Engineer"" become so big??
2. **On that note: ""Senior"" vs ""Lead"" vs ""Entry Level""**...the difference to me is huge, but most companies seem to be pretty flexible with what they're posting. Some entry level jobs have been open to changing to senior level, some lead/manager level would be fine with senior. If you like a job but are weary about the experience required, just ask the hiring manager/recruiter that posted it.
3. **Every company has a different way of testing your knowledge.** So far I've taken a data science timed assessment (no outside resources), completed a take-home assessment (48 hours and a dataset), and presented a past project for 30 minutes, all for different companies. Be prepared for just about anything, but use how they test you as a clue into their culture. For me, I love the take-home tests and presentations because they give me a chance to show what I know without as much of the pressure.
4. **Companies are starting to open back up.** Many job postings were taken down from March-May, but as of today the number of openings is expanding rapidly. Region may be a big factor. The companies I have interviewed with have stuck to either all virtual, or majority virtual with one in-person interview with masks and social distancing.

I'm at a point where I need to decide what I want to really do with my life. I have been accepted to med school but during my gap year I learned about data science as a career option and about 1 year MS degrees for Data Science. 

I have no programming experience. I liked the intro to stats and probability class I took in college. I have had experience with applying statistics in labs, experiments, etc.

I realized that if I go via the data science track I would want to first gain experience working for other companies but eventually start my own company that does consulting for others. Is this a possibility even? How does the lifestyle look like? Having time for family is the single most important factor for me and why I'm having second-thoughts about my initial career choice. I want to work M-F and have the weekend off type thing, and/or ability to work from home.

With all of the things going on in the world, I know my problem shouldn't even seem like a problem but both of my career options have been kind of ""shot in the dark scenarios"" where I can only imagine what the job may be but not actually experience it (this applies even more for data science for me because I don't know anyone that works in that field nor have a shadowed/interned).

The job requires some level of mathematics and derivatives pricing model. While this is not a front office job, the salary is not very high (\~100k for associate/junior vp and very difficult to get promoted further). I worked there for a few years and I was tired of the office politics and doing the same thing every day makes me feeling bored. And also because of some personal reason I'm physically not available to go office every day any more and I need a few years to recover, therefore I have quitted the job.

For these few years, I want to upskill myself so that possibly maybe I can make a career switch. I don't want to go back to the old role again because many investment banks has already started to move the non front-office departments to cheaper locations, even though there are still jobs the pay is limited and the competition for promotion is huge.

I'm think of learning programming or data analytics, and thinking to market myself as a person with programming/data analytics skills and with derivatives pricing knowledge.

Below are a few ideas I had on tackling this question, but I am wondering how you would approach this. 

1. Use a factor analysis method on the won opportunities for a sales rep and analyze the axes with low explanation of variance. Would this essentially tell me what makes these companies the same, as opposed to different? 

2. Use logistic regression with all the opportunities and analyze the significant variables that increase the probability of winning.",Advice in B2B Sales Analysis,1591218494

datascience,"Hi folks! I am currently working as a Software Engineer in a Reporting/Analysis team using SAP BO and SQL. I am trying to get a job as a data scientist and had applied to a bunch of companies and did attend interview in a few. In the last interview which I gave, the interviewer asked me the above question, and I couldn't say anything which was able to convince him.

I have taken a bunch of MOOC courses and had worked on common UCI datasets. I have recently started with Kaggle as well (trying the basic one's right now). I know I have to improve a lot, but this question keeps on pondering me, as the interviewer was okay with me working with iris dataset as I am fresher with less than 1 year of full-time experience. He just wanted to know my answer to the above question. I tried thinking and giving a generalized answer but he wasn't impressed and asked how did you solve iris problem. Having watched n number of tutorials, the bias kicked in and I just said that I need to do EDA, understand the relationship between parameters and then go about solving the problem by applying, any of the many Classification algorithm, which I had done.

But he wasn't having it and this got me thinking that in the real-world you won't be given a dataset to work with, forget about proper expectation/requirement. And you cannot waste/invest a lot of time doing EDA as the client is looking for a working model and not a bunch of graphs and visualizations, so how to actually approach a ML/DS problem?

Can some of the folks working in the field describe to me, as how would have you answered the above question and typical tasks or problem statement you get during your job and your thought process in approaching the task.

thanks for your time, much appreciated :)",How do you approach ML/ DS problem?,1591200231
