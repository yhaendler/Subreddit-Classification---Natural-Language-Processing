Here is my problem ,I want a job in Data science/Statistics job(non-government) and I have plenty of projects to show as well as a github page . I am willing to move to the USA ,(I am an EU citizen).

The only work experience/job offer I have is in Audit(accounting) with a Big 4(which I accepted), that said they would let me move into their data science department if I wanted to.

My main problem is financially a masters in my opinion is unnecessary since i have taken 9 masters modules already , and I already have a job that I can start this September. A statistics professor I am friends with , said a masters for me would be a waste of time and stupid.

Which data science companies/ Tech companies can I apply to without a masters that would take me in with just a bachelor's ? Accounting will bore me to death.

Looking at my modules, is there anything core that is missing in a masters program ?

The competition is like from 2 years of data predict one month of sales. So we would need to predict from January 1st to January 31st. My partner is adamant about using one day before lags or two day before lags in training the model and then in outputting the prediction. 

My issue is that when you attempt to output the prediction from the model in terms of features, you cannot use a lag from one day before when predicting the 30 days from now row. Since that number resides in the test set and you have to output predictions as if these numbers do not exist. So you would need to progressively fill your future lag features with NA. They don't see a problem with predicting a future value with values that you cannot know at the time you run the model, even though we have those values as it is an assignment. Basically, you are trying to predict all values in a period of time and your method of producing those predictions depends on the very thing you are tasked with outputting. 

Basically, what type of leakage is it when you are trying to create predictors that rely on data you cannot know from the test set. I am going insane that I cannot get this person to see how you cannot use any of the true values from the test set when attempting to predict from the test set. It is a contradiction. If you wanted to avoid NA's in your features at most you could predict one day from now. If you want to predict between tomorrow and 30 days from now, you cannot use the answer from 29 days from now to put next to 30 days from now since you ""dont know"" any of the answers from that time.",What type of data leakage is this?,1580800844

So I will be enrolling a Master's of Science in Data Science (MSDS) next term (Fall semester). This MSDS program requires me to take 10 courses, 2 of which are electives.

My concern about doing this, however, is that I wonder if I would be better served in taking different electives instead. While taking such courses will dramatically improve my understanding of econometrics, I would miss out on possibly taking other courses dealing with Bayesian statistics, nonparametric regression, and advanced programming - of all which I also have an interest in.

I am a junior engineer and currently I have been doing some data work for an upcoming project and I would greatly appreciated some guidance. I am by no means a Data science guy although I am proficient with python using some of the numerical packages.

Essentially I have four sets of data (scattered) where three are independent variables (Flying hours, Flying Cycles, Aircraft age) and one dependent variable (Repair Cost). I aim at modelling these four such that Repair Cost = some function f(Flying hours, Flying Cycles, Aircraft Age) and then infer based on their relationship.

I have tried for the life of me to apply a linear multi variable regression but all the results seem inconclusive. I also tried a surface curve fitting and then interpolate it but to no avail.

Furthermore, some independent variables might be dependent on each other (e.g Older aircraft might fly lower flying hour routes).

I would just love to know how you guys would approach this task. I want to do this by myself but I keep thinking im heading in the wrong direction. What methods would suit best for this kind of work or what literature should I be reading?

datascience,"Hi all,

  
I recently developed a genetic algorithm to solve the following problem:  


Given a vector **X** of length *n* containing 1s and 0s, find the optimal vector **X** that minimizes the objective function f(x).

More concretely, let's say I have n = 2, then there are 4 possible vectors **x :**  
\[1,0\], \[0,1\], \[1,1\], \[0,0\].   


My objective function f(x) has some ""network"" effects, which means it takes the whole vector **x** as input and I can not simply describe f(x) as a dot product between **x** and some constant weight vector **w**. Instead, turning both products ""on"" (having vector \[1,1\]) gives rise to a network effect, with something in the objective function going on such as w1\*x1+w2\*x2+w3\*(x1\*x3).   
This is not really whats going on in the objective function but the point is that it is not a dot product between w and x.

I am thinking that it might be possible to solve this optimization problem in a better way. The genetic algorithm performs decently for small values of n, but I am sure I won't be able to find the optimal solution.   


My feeling says that I somehow have to change the objective function to make it linear so I can solve it using linear programming. But I have no clue how to do this.. Are there any resources for learning how to do so?",[Optimization problem] GA to linear programming?,1580739569

datascience,"I get that if two of more variables are highly correlated, the standard error of the coefficients would be inflated. That got me thinking, aren't a lot of variables more or less related linearly in real life? It's hard to find instances are variables are completely independent. 

I'm reading a chapter on regression and one of the assumptions it makes is that the variables come from an ""elliptically symmetric distribution"" and that 

E(x1 | x2) = a+b x2,

and that if the variables comes from a multivariate normal distribution it's an even stronger condition.

So does this mean you can have variables that have linearly related expectations but as long as correlations is weak it's still ok?

datascience,"Hi there, I'm someone with a current career/degree in a totally different field, so I'm trying to learn what I can before making any next steps. I found out data science existed just recently and it sounds very interesting. I always liked statistics, and have had an interest in programming, so it seems like a good fit. 

I also just recently met with someone else in my company about their position as an Industrial Engineer, and it got me really excited. The way he described it was having a multitude of different projects, all mostly focused on finding the most efficient ways to work, or providing reports on how they function. I had also never heard of Industrial Engineering before this! I think I'd love to pursue something in that direction, and after looking over the data science program I've been looking at, he said it seemed very applicable.

That said, I don't want to invest time and money in a degree to find out it isn't going to help me get the position I was thinking of. I see a lot of people talk about going into IE from DS, but is a masters in DS going to help me get a position in IE like I described? Is there anything else I should know going in?

Hey everyone,

I'm a crossroads with my career at the moment, and would appreciate some advice. Background, I'm fresh out of college but have quite a lot of Data Science internship experience and that is where I would like my career to grow.

I have two offers on the table from a company I interned for in the past, both are labeled as Data Science positions

1. \~95K Base Salary, California. Fledgling team in a newly invested area and would be mostly automation through Excel/VBA/ PowerBI Dashoarding etc. with some Data Science on the top but not prioritized. Ironically this location is where most Data Scientist in the company reside, just not on this particular team. You are allowed to move teams after 1 year.
2. \~65K Base Salary, Pennsylvania. Established Data Science team. Work would be mostly analytics and predictive modeling. There are strong technical leads on this team.

The first:

Pros:

* Visible role == any impact is magnified
* \~30K more(After tax around 18k difference)
* More Data Science happening in this location
* 4x number of employees on this site compared to other

Cons

* Automation isn't where I want to grow, and I fear my resume, skillsets and future opportunities in DS might be hindered because of it.
* Possibly pigeonholing?
* Most DS skills and efforts would have to be self-taught and accomplished outside of work.

Second:

Pros:

* Much more technical team == mentoring opportunities
* Work would directly align with where I want to grow
* Lower cost of living

Cons

* \~30K less(After tax around 18k difference)
* Smaller location == less networking opportunities
* Lower visibility role
* Cold as hell

I want to grow as a Data Scientist and I believe it would be easier if it was nurtured from a knowledgeable team, but that 30K might be excellent incentive to learn independently.
