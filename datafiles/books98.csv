books,"Okay, so I’m aware there are certain issues with certain male authors writing about their females characters in ways that are unrealistic at best and insulting and sexist at worst. Of course, it seems only logical to expect these issues to crop up more in books from certain eras. Even so, my feminist soul was irked tonight while reading Dracula. Bram Stoker has Lucy Westenra, in a letter to Mina, write “Men like women, certainly their wives, to be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always as they should be”.

Well, thank goodness Mr Stoker took efforts to remind us womenfolk of what is expected of us. I shall henceforth resolve to be as fair as my other half, for he may make me a wife one day, and men certainly do like their wives to be fair. Mr Stoker’s effort to communicate this to us through the words of one of the fairer sex does not go unappreciated, for, try as I might, I find myself so much more inclined to accept sexist nonsense from other women than from gentlemen such as Bram.",Men writing women,1620172475

books,"First off, I am decently new to reading books for entertainment. Younger me enjoyed comics and games a lot more but I now feel a strong urge to dive into the source of stories I loved and new ones. The first 3 that came to mind was: LOTR/Hobbit, GB: The lies of locke lamora, and the Witcher (finished the W3 a few years ago)

All three were on my cart until I stumbled upon some forums on the ""sexism and objectification"" of women in the witcher. I am not sure if this true and is overblown so I cam here. Now I don't mind a little implication of love making or kisses I guess but I do get quite disturbed by overly sexual descriptions and incest and all that. As I understand there is plenty of that in fantasy but the witcher apparently describes every women's breasts? And every woman loves geralt and wants to make love even the side characters? I loved the witcher 3 and I am interested in the universe but I won't buy a book if I will have to worry about who reads this and judge me or something even if the underlying story is good. I guess to answer the previous sentence ask yourself : ""Would I give my parents and siblings the witcher to read,"" assuming they are all 18+ of course.

Tldr: I went to get into fantasy, books to read first are Hobbit/LOTR, Gentleman bastards and the witcher. I am worried about how overly sexualized the witcher is and if its worth a buy for someone like me who is disgusted by overly done graphic descriptions. I am interested in the witcher universe from the Witcher 3.

books,"I love being a mom, but I have never had a single moment when I thought ""I want another baby, I miss having a baby!"". Honestly, every year older my daughter has gotten has just been more and more enjoyable, especially now that she's excited about reading for herself. 


She's seven now, and she reads on her own pretty constantly, but we still have the ritual of reading books before bed. I loved this ritual when it was board books with words she didn't understand, I loved it when they were rhyming books that she would memorize and recite with me, and I loved it when they were longer picture books, especially books I remembered from my own childhood. But in the last couple of years we've started reading chapter books, and I'm getting to share with her some of my FAVORITE stories, and it's the most incredible experience.


We read the first few Harry Potter books 3 times, because she always wanted to start again when we were finished. Each time she convinced me to read a couple books farther, until this year when we finally finished the series. I know there's a lot of content that she can't fully comprehend, but just sharing the story with her and seeing her get so into it (she was Hermione for Halloween 2 years in a row) is amazing. We've also read Ella Enchanted twice, one of my all-time favorite books from when I was a kid, and when we finished it the last time she said ""That is my FAVORITE book!"" 


The books I'm reading with her were such a big part of my life, for years and years before she was even born. When we read them together it feels like we're creating a special bond that is separate from other parts of our mother-daughter relationship.

books,"
It is unexplained of what lies behind this abnormal metamorphosis. This transformation is a context for exposing deep feelings such as alienation, isolation, and loneliness.

Gregor is already feeling isolated at his job. His constant travel allows him to make casual acquaintances that are always new and never become intimate friends. His work is strenuous for he has to travel day in and day out. Despite this, he is glued to his job because his parents have a huge debt to pay off and also his entire family - his mother, father, and sister Grete is dependent on him financially. Things take a twist when Gregor turns into a vermin. 

Quite obviously, he is not able to continue with his job with his new transformation. His inability to be useful to his family gradually changes his family's outlook towards him.

His mother panics and considers that her son is unfortunate and has encountered some illness. She hopes that her son will soon recover to his natural state. 

His father is horrified by his son's transformation and aims to avoid the sight of Gregor, through whatever possible means like throwing apples on him or kicking him or pushing him back in his room with the help of a cane. 

Grete, on the contrary, sympathizes with his brother and amidst all the panic and horror spread in the house, she chooses to daycare him (without catching sight of him) by providing him food, thinking about his convenience and respecting his feelings through possible actions. 

Although Gregor transforms physically, he is still a human on an emotional level. He works his own way out through his metamorphosis. With time, he experiences feelings that are hard to deal with but sadly enough he cannot convey his mental state to the people around him. Gregor's voice turns to that of an animal making him unable to communicate with humans, adding more to his isolation. 

To save his family from any sort of embarrassment or panic, he hides from their sight however possible. He eavesdrops on his family through a slit on his room's door to understanding their state. He feels ashamed of himself that he could not live up to his family's expectations (financially). He is drawn back. He realizes that his identity as a human is fading and his family is disconnecting with him over time.

On a physical level, Gregor discovers a liking for things which he could not have thought of otherwise. He craves for rotted food. He is comfortable staying in dark and small places. He climbs up the walls and hangs on the ceiling upside down. Although Grete sympathizes with her brother at first, she turns disinterested in him down the line. His mother passes out if she sees Gregor accidentally. His father treats him ruthlessly and forces him to stay in his room. 

Gradually with the circumstances, Gregor's family realizes that having a horrible looking creature in their home will do them no good. Neither he is able to provide them financially, nor he makes their current living any easier. 

Eventually, Grete suggests her parents to get rid of Gregor for the betterment of their lives. The father agrees to Grete and takes the decision to eliminate Gregor from their life. He also expects that his son will understand their condition and relieve them sooner. 

Gregor understands his family's decision and with a hope to relieve his family from his unwanted burden he isolates himself completely in his bedroom and then one day dies. His death induces a sense of relief in his family. They move to a different apartment and thus move on with the remnants of Gregor's existence. 

The story ends showing that Gregor's parents are now planning to look for a suitable groom for their daughter Grete.",Book Summary: Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka,1620159822

What is “the phantom twin motif”? What does it mean?

How does it appear in his work?

I will try to give my thoughts on it

Basil and Sybil idolise a pure being , kind of like a child who hasn’t seen the horrors of the superficial society Wilde lived in ( Victorian era ) Lord Henry is a satire of the average englishmen , a classist hedonist who has a wrong idea of the world , a moral person with immoral ideals . An ignorant being who doesn’t understand the psychological diversity of life , he is very unrealistic and thinks of life as a book with tragedies and romances .

Harry is the trigger of dorian’s cynicism , basil taught him to be vain of his looks but Harry  preached the superficial significance of youth . The temporary nature of virtue is what makes it a virtue , in chapter 19-20 he realises that his blessing of eternal youth becomes a curse . His portrait is the metaphor for his soul after murdering basil , the portrait becomes more hideous and deplorable . He tries to hide his past by destroying the portrait but ends up killing his soul ie the portrait .

IMO it is the satire of Victorian era and the moral corruption of an innocent child after being influenced by cynics . The slow descent into madness , the corruption of the soul and reinforcing hedonistic ideals

Another interesting thing - Harry quotes hamlet - like the painting of a sorrow , a face without a heart Referring to basil but Wilde was signalling the careless attitude of Dorian. Where he is indifferent to the death of basil , vane and Alan Campbell

books,I'm interested in starting to read Tom Clancy's books but I don't know which book to start with. I planned on reading hunt for red October First because it's his first book but from what I've read without remorse is the first one in the series chronologically. Can anyone give some advice on why hunt for red October/without remorse is a better book to start off with?,Hunt for red October or without remorse?,1620148315
books,"I feel like it's easy for me to stick to certain genres and not venture out as much as I'd like to. For example, I would love to dive into fantasy, but it's not my usual go-to. I know I need to just try out different books and see which ones I enjoy, but would love to hear other peoples experience with this!

Were there any genres you thought you wouldn't enjoy, but ended up really loving and diving into more? Was there a certain book that was the ""gateway"" to a new genre for you?","What are some genres you normally don't gravitate to, but ended up enjoying more than you thought you would?",1620147767

books,"I once read a really good book but I can't remember the title of it. It was about a lesbian love story that takes place in high school. One of the girls had just arrived to town and her family was very liberal. There is one scene where someone vandalized her house with the word ""Dyke"" and she tells the other girl (the main character) something that was a lot like words are just words unless you give them meaning. She also has a twin brother. The main character was conservative parents, since its a small town. At around page 50, maybe, the one with the conservative parents tells the girl who moved into town that she likes her, but the other girl thinks it would just be an experiment, then the free preview ended. I now have the chance to buy this book and its driving me nuts not knowing the title or even the names of the characters! Hahah i know this is the same plot as a lot of other LGBTQ stories but anything, even if you're not sure could help! Thank you!",Help figuring out book title?,1620147499
books,"Seriously. I thought Yosemite and “YAWS MIGHT” were both very real, very different national parks up until waaay too old of an age. I was in high school when it clicked for me, and I’d absolutely had more than one conversation with others regarding some video I’d seen of a couple weird little alien dudes in Yawsmight by then. 

Colonel, of course. My mom laughed hard when I told her I thought David Bowie (said with a bow wow sound) was cool. Still to this day I accidentally say “COURTesy” as in court and cringe. The “si, mom” I kept encounterling in YA novels for some reason wasn’t confusing Jamaican sounding slang for something. It was “c’mon” as in COME ON. At least I was still super young when I figured that one out. 

There’s no way I’m the only one who’s had this issue. I know what the words mean, and I usually know the real way it’s said, but I just don’t connect the dots that the words are one. As soon as I use my new vocabulary in person I get that LOOK. The “what did you just say lmaooo” look. Being an avid reader who doesn’t get out and talk to people much is so common, and those two things make up the recipe for Reader’s Pronunciation. Like I can’t even be the first to coin a dumb name for it, right? This has to be a thing. Please tell me I’m not alone. 

These days I communicate with others in person a lot more than I did in middle school, so it isn’t near as much of a problem as it used to be. Still, once in a while a word comes out that I haven’t used in forever and I have that fun embarrassing feeling once again because I just know I didn’t say it right.","Reader’s pronunciation, anyone?",1620147442
