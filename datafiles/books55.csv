books,"I’ve been scratching my head trying to remember the name of this book series. It wasn’t quite young adult but it was a series (and I do mean a SERIES) of at least 10+ books about a girl with very, very curly hair. I believe one of the lines was her saying that she had extraordinary hair, and an ordinary face, and wishing it could have been the opposite. 

I remember reading these books, which I could find at Barnes &amp; Noble, sometime in elementary or middle school, so 2006-2010 range. Im scratching my head for more details but I can’t remember it.

books,"First off, I don't know who the author is, and that could be a huge blow to trying to find this novel. what I can do is describe the plot for you.

I remember it being a fight to the death sort of deal, where you get summoned by aliens to fight in this battle royale. you get to bring one weapon with you, and in this story the fight takes place in a library.

each alien summons someone from a different planet, and if the person they choose dies, so do they. 

our main character is a businessman \[I Think\] and he lives with his daughter \[Name I Cannot Remember Her Name\]

her and the father gets transported suddenly to the library, where the alien describes all of this to him.  unfortunately, he had no idea that this was going to happen until just then.

confused, I think he tries to escape the library only to find a huge monster like creature, they fight, he wins, etc.

I dont remember much after that, and I think it could \[maybe\] be a series, but i'm not sure about that.

the reason I went to Reddit instead of well...google, is because there seems to be nothing like this as far as I could see, so if i'm going to find this book I'll need help.

Much of the characters in Americanah feel very *written*; that is, they seem to exist for an ""a-ha!"" moment that is, at times, to me, comically simplistic. Much of the discussion about race in the book is intricate and interesting, but equally as much if not more seems simple and even silly. The book feels very one note.

I'm wondering if we read the same book, or if this series ever gets better. I can't bring myself to read the second book for fear it'll be as bad as the first. 

---------

If I were to summarize the structure of the book, it definitely has a ""throw everything and the kitchen sink at the plot and hope something sticks"" quality to it. The beginning is fairly strong, with Egwene's prologue followed by the developments in town and the group leaving. But then Nynaeve returns to the story, apparently purely to be a foil for Moraine, and to generate some drama. It's pure artifice as far as I can tell - unmotivated by prior events, and justified post-hoc by remarks of her tracking skill. 

But that event, in and of itself, wasn't enough to put me off. I'm okay with a bit of obvious contrivance if it pays off down the line. No big deal. Except the contrivances don't pay off. They never pay off. Take, for example, when the protagonists get chased by trollocs and cornered on the way to Whitebridge. We're told the trollocs will overtake the group, and that Moraine doesn't have it in her to summon a wall of fire again. But, no worries, Shadar Logoth materializes as a plot device to allow the characters to escape (for a while, anyway).

These kinds of artificial, unmotivated structural and plot devices plagues the novel. It's an almost constant deluge of conveniences and deus ex machina. Almost everything that happens from the second quarter of the novel, through to the end, feels like Jordan writing in something to keep the plot moving because he couldn't think of a organic way to do it. Don't even get me started on this idea that Rand, Mat, and Perrin are ""ta'veren,"" which is pretty much just an excuse for all the lazy contrivances throughout the book. 

----------

And then there's Moraine. Not only is she a walking exposition machine, providing background whenever something convenient needs to appear (though the worst example of exposition is actually when we learn Lan's background from ), she also robs other characters of any agency. 

Whenever things get to tight, Moraine appears to save the day with magic. Mat getting too paranoid? Don't know how to keep the story going? Never fear, Moraine is here to use magic to make it not a problem. Who needs conflict in a novel? Why have interesting plot developments when you... Moraine! What's that? Perrin and Egwene captured by an army of whitecloaks? Never fear, Moraine is here to plot device them right out of there. But wait, there's more! Need a false conflict to give the novel a sense of urgency? Perfect, make everyone suspicious of Moraine and make them dislike her, even though she literally never does anything remotely bad or questionable after leaving the Two Rivers. Surely baseless insinuation is enough to drive the story. 

I'd also like to say some things about Rand, but he's basically the mayonnaise of protagonists. He never has to make any real choices, is never faced with any real challenges to his beliefs or ideals, and blindly follows what Moraine says... *despite* regularly thinking about how little he trusts her. 

-------------

I could go on. There's so much in this book that is so aggressively, dare I say, overwhelmingly mediocre. Much of the story is just The Lord of the Rings, but executed worse. Shadar Logoth is Robert E. Howard-esque, but executed worse. And so on it goes, with the real disappointment being the poor execution. 

That said, I do want to end on a positive note. There are spaces in the novel where things are interesting, and threaten to keep be interesting (a promise that's never kept, sadly). The opening is fantastic up until the point that Rand, Mat, and Perrin leave home. I found Rand's short adventure in the city (where he meets Loiel and climbs the wall to the castle) to be interesting, clearly inserting characters who will come up in the sequels. And I liked Perrin's wolf adventure, more or less. Each of these parts stands on its own, and each could have been interesting adventures, full of character development, that tie together in a satisfactory way later on.

books,"I think we should define 'elitism' before I make my argument. 

Elitism according to [Dictionary.com](https://Dictionary.com) is defined as follows: 

1.  (*often used with a plural verb*) the choice or best of anything considered collectively, as of a group or class of persons.
2.  (*used with a plural verb*) persons of the highest class
3.  a group of persons exercising the major share of authority or influence within a larger group.

Now to my argument. A recent post on Faulkner's *As I Lay Dying* captured my interest for its extraordinarily shallow analysis and subsquent disparagement of Faulkner's great novel. Obviously, I am biased but why should this prove some defect to my argument? This subreddit is totally about subjective interpretations, analyses, reviews about literature from past to the present. Yet, the analysis provided by the OP proved what I have noticed for sometime on this subreddit. I doubt this post will do much to sway anyone's opinion. We are hardly a world of readers, strong and weak, so I assume whoever does read is in vogue to, and believes, in the latest ideas of literature however lackluster they may be. I suppose as someone who is not particularly impressed by current cultural and postmodern interpretations and reviews of literature that something should be said in defense of classic works of literature. I realize I am of the old guard but so be it. 

Elite readers and writers are perhaps in more need of today in our world where dictatorships are also in fashion. Elitism is actually a good thing for us. Books that are considered classic obviously owe some of their popularity to culture and politics. Shakespeare was, unsurprisingly, paraded around the world by the British Empire as the highest indication of British and White superiority. Yet, the fact stands that a Shakespeare did in fact create and write some of the most memorable characters in the history of literature. Likewise, it stands that those among us who understand the power of Faulkner are attuned to the unforgettable quality of a tragic Quentin Compson or a sadistic Jason Compson. In any case, why shouldn't we desire an elite class of readers and writers? Classic writers, for the most part, have left an inevitable mark on the world. 

What most surprised me about the recent post was OP's suggestion that we ought not to read Faulkner because Faulkner was pretentious. Yet, this is always the case isn't it, for the educated and the intellectual? I recall the hilarious Fran Lebowitz who in the documentary Public Speaking says something to the effect of ""Americans love the elite. By the elite we mean the rich. They do not like the elite intellectuals, however. This is not the elite that Americans like."" Why do we hate pretentious intellectuals or educated elites especially in the humanities and the arts? 

Car mechanics and car enthusiasts, of which I count my family as a group of car enthusiasts, pride themselves on their cars, their love of exotic, rare, or racing cars. In what society on earth does its people rant actively against the pretentiousness and elitism or car enthusiasts? Name one. In what society do the people complain about the pretentiousness of auto mechanics and car enthusiasts but praise elite writers and intellectuals? If I recommended you a car you'd hope I would recommend you the best car I could recommend, is this not true? And you think cars take you 'somewhere' and this is why they are more valuable but literature doesnt 'take' you anywhere? I think pretentiousness is the only reason we should read any book considered a classic. Reading is difficult and demands our full attention. You can drive on the freeway and be distracted by innumerable objects, but try reading and playing on your phone or sending a text and see what you can do with a text. Not much of anything. In this way, reading really takes you somewhere deeper than any place you've actually ever drive to. Roads are superficial and on the surface. Books, great works linger below, in our subconscious and in our dreams and memories. 

Why would I waste time reading an author who didn't think of his or herself as pretentious in some way? Elitism is good. I think the global society has always hated elite, the deeply intellectual and experimental elite writers because they reveal to us our shortcomings, biases, and failures. Nothing really said by me here has never been written elsewhere. I am not writing anything new. Originality is quite illusory in many ways. I would be foolish to think I have said much of anything new, only what I believe is necessary to say again. 

OP wrote in his post, that "" We can all stop pretending that he’s brilliant because we are afraid of being called dumb."" But I think if Faulkner's writing reveals some uncomfortable truth about ourselves or if his character exposes us to some good quality within us already, then this is entirely the reason why we should both to read him at all. 

Literature full of cliches and platitudes is only inspiring to minds that are shallow. But none of us need to remain shallow and base for the rest of our lives, and, in fact, most of us, I believe can truly make our minds and intellects great through reading works of literature considered great. I think we should only read elite, classic works of literature over and over again. Car mechanics, carpenters, craftspeople, inventors and builders of products and objects the world over are never disparaged and are always in high demand. Why are we, the literati of this subreddit and this world so afraid to be thought of as pretentious and elite? I only re-read Proust, Melville, Emerson, Neruda, Tolstoy, and Homer because I do believe they are the most intellectual and deeply persuasive and pensive writers in the history of literature. Sometimes I read something newere and it moves me and sometimes new works make me cringe. I think we need not disparage a writer or work for its pretentiousness or the associations of elitism that a writer or novel conjures. Aesthetic and intellectual qualms with a writer deserve our attention. Not what a society or culture thinks about the writer and how that opinion has therefore influenced your view.","Elitism, Pretentiousness, and Reading",1601401129

books,"I read *Americanah* a few years ago and enjoyed it, so I picked up Ngozi Adichie's earlier novel and was happy to see it was more of a sprawling work of historical fiction, a la *Pachinko,* which I'd really loved (saw someone else compare these two on r/books)

I wasn't that familiar with the history, and i enjoyed the way the cast of characters were close knit, but still gave a diverse set of viewpoints on how the post-colonial conflicts of the era bubbled over into a brutal civil war. 

At first, I was disappointed that the war started so early in the novel, since I still felt like I was getting to know the characters, but I guess that's the point: war interrupts what's interesting about people's lives and turns them into survivors. As it went on, and as I saw how the survivalist mentality affected the characters differently, I started to feel closeness with them that way instead of through the dinner table intellectual conversation that dominated the first third of the book.

I guess the main way I felt disappointed was that, because the perspective is tied so closely to a few characters, I din't feel like I got a real sense of the scale of the devastation in Biafra. Maybe that's just a melodramatic predisposition on my part, but with as many trials as the main characters are going through, I never really felt like they were in serious danger (and in fact the main character who does disappear  only does so in the last few pages.)

books,"This is, obviously, related to the post that blew up today on this sub. 

It's particularly personal for me as As I Lay Dying is one of my favorite books and a book that really changed my life in that it changed my way of reading and understanding of literature. 

I picked up the book at a middle school book sale when I was 13 (my school had an annual book sale where kids could empty their shelves at home and the school library would sell them as a fundraiser). Up to that point I'd been a precocious reader and thought I could handle whatever adult novels were out there. I'd read Dracula, Anne Rice, Stephen King (my parents love horror), Tom Robbins, Jack London, To Kill a Mockingbird and a few other things (in addition to your normal middle school stuff for school like Gary Paulson's Hatchet (which is great, by the way) and I liked most of it. 

So at the sale, I see As I Lay Dying and I think, ""I've heard of Faulkner, he's supposed to be for smart people."" I'd never really read any classics like that, but I wanted to be smart, so I bought it. Also, it's not very long, so I figured it would be easy. 

WRONG. It was NOT easy. For the first time in my reading life, I had no idea what was going on or what was happening or who these people even were I was reading about. To be honest, I had to re-read chapters and really take my time with the words. 

But it got easier as I understood that each chapter was told from a different point of view and that that's how you understood each character. It got easier in part because I came to understand the characters in a way I had NEVER understood characters before. I love science fiction and I can only compare Faulkner to that type of world building--you inhabit these people. 

I didn't know people WROTE books like this or that you COULD write a book like this. The book was my very first glimpse into a whole new way of telling stories and reading stories. 

And funny enough, it set up for me an appreciation for the same authors I'd already been reading. Later on in life, I read Cujo by King and appreciated when he inhabited the dog's POV and then I read The Star Rover, Jack London's bizarre little science fiction book that's mostly entirely interior monologue by a guy being tortured in solitary confinement who visits past lives and I LOVED it. 

But nothing is quite as good as the first time and so I'd always think back to As I Lay Dying. 

Getting that book and reading it, it was as if all I'd ever eaten was oatmeal and then someone had offered me pepperoni pizza (not to denigrate oatmeal, oatmeal is fine.)

All this to say, if you read that post earlier, please ignore it. The book DOES make sense if you work with it. Also, yes, it does require work. No, you don't have to read it four times. Heck, I don't think you HAVE to read any book for times to enjoy it. You just need to spend time with it. 

(THAT said, I had a college course where we read A Light in August and the professor described it as a good way to introduce yourself to Faulkner and I have to agree with that.)

Finally, to the mods, why are we allowing posts in here that are, I would argue, essentially troll posts? I mean, any criticism that's essentially ""I didn't like this therefore it's trash"" isn't valuable discussion or even criticism. Books are an essential part of life and they're beloved by most of us here (all of us, probably) and this sort of critique is lazy and it is offensive to people who DO like As I Lay Dying. 

All of us have books we didn't like for whatever reason--but unless the OP is willing to acknowledge their personal point of view and bias, then what's the point? For instance, I don't like Johnathan Livingston Seagull because I'm not really into self help and positive thinking type stuff is a reasonable point of view. 

Saying I didn't like Johnathan Livingston Seagull because it is boring and therefore it's trash is a dumb thing to say and, again, contributes nothing and likely will hurt the feelings of someone who loves the book (and, to be very clear, that is NOT my opinion, just an example.)

books,"I’ve just finished reading Brave New World by Aldous Huxley and it is by far the most disturbing piece of literature I’ve ever read. Perhaps because it is meant to cause some discomfort to its readers and rightfully so. I can’t say I’ve enjoyed it thoroughly but I was most impressed by the 17th chapter where they talked about the elimination of inconvenience, the need for God and the price of happiness among other things. Reading it made me feel the same way when I read Dostoyevsky’s The Grand Inquisitor, although both are very different. But I think that chapter was the highlight to me in Brave New World.  It’s scary to think that as the modern world progresses, so does the society’s  hunger for the attainment of happiness but the difference is the emphasis of self, whereas in the book, individuals are conditioned to belong to a sustainable society. “Everyone belongs to every one else.” I think the greatest takeaway for me is that the absence of problems and inconvenience does not automatically lead to happiness and that freedom is too high a price to pay for utopia.

books,"In early 2019 I read Pierre Lemaitre's The Great Swindle, and loved it. A quick search alerted me to a sequel, which was slated for release in English in the not too distant future. I came back later, and could not find any more info about it, except that the date I'd originally seen was now sometime in September 2020 (which goodreads still lists, as do other sites). September has passed without release  I find conflicting information on a new release date. Much of the info I can find is from sites in countries other than my own and out of sync with what I'd expect (a paperback release in January? But there's no mention of when the hardcover release is.). I found a google link to his UK publisher that seemed to be for the book, but it is dead and there doesn't seem to be any mention of the book on their site. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some sites speak of the book as if it were released in 2019 as originally expected. Amazon sellers have two copies (for sale for over $60) which I suspect are the original French but are listed under the English listing and have been since around the time of its initially planned release (I'm tempted to order one on the off chance some early copies made it out the door and the release got pushed back for some reason). The book seems to have had two titles at different points in its translation which further muddies the waters.

books," 

The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the Unknown. But how do we view this Unknown and what are its patterns of being? Where does this fear originate from and what is the meaning behind it? 

There are many questions when it comes to the Fear of the Unknown and in the video below I tried to explore the depths of our Unconscious through the life and work of H. P. Lovecraft and Carl Jung.

Firstly, let’s see who exactly was H.P. Lovecraft? Well, Lovecraft was an American writer of weird and horror fiction who became famous for his creation of the Cthulhu Mythos.

In his stories, the focus was set on interpreting the place of humankind in the universe. For Lovecraft, humanity was an unimportant part of Cosmos that didn’t care for it. Moreover, the entire Cosmos could be swept away at any given moment!

Dreams, those gateways to the unconscious as Carl Jung claimed, had an important place in the literary career of Lovecraft. Many of his writings were influenced by dreams that are, as Lovecraft in the Hypnos tale says: “those rare dreams beyond dreams which come never to common men, and but once or twice in the lifetime of imaginative men”

Mosig tells us that Lovecraft “shifted the source of horror from the traditional but no longer believable ghosts and demons, to the vast and unplumbed abysses beyond space and time, and to the equally unknown recesses of the human mind” to the so-called “torturous depths of the unconscious”.

On the other hand, Jung teaches us that the Modern Man suffers horribly from the feelings of emptiness and disillusionment due to the extreme and terrible separation of the rational and the spiritual which is repressed into the unconscious; and Lovecraft’s characters feel it the most.

books,"This post was inspired by u/Karl_Marxs_Left_Ball's recent enraged post on ""As I Lay Dying"" by Faulkner.

I love reading. ever since I was a wee young lad I've enjoyed it. In fact I enjoy reading so much I chose English to be my major in college (which was a mistake).  Thinking about the aforementioned post I was struck by how i enjoyed almost none of my English classes throughout middle school or high school. My love of reading came from the books I chose on my own, not those mandated by my teachers. I remember reading ""As I Lay Dying"" and thinking it was just incredibly pretentious.  My teacher continued to attempt to ascribe meaning to the various sections and imagery and I couldn't care less. Another example was ""A Raisin in the Sun."" I loathe the book with a passion, if it is even worthy of the moniker book. ""Slaughterhouse 5"" was a nonsensical book that made no sense and conveyed nothing to me except the feeling the author indulged in large amount of cocaine while writing. My English class this semester had us read ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker, and for possibly the first time in my life I actually enjoyed an assigned reading.

So why does it seem that School and Literary teachers pick the worst possible books to assign? Shouldn't they be choosing books that inspire their students to read, not drive them away from it. Talking to my friends(mid 20's), most of those who dislike reading feel that way because of English class and the horrid books we were forced to bullshit meaning into.",School and the Destruction of books,1601387763

I hadn’t been reading any books for a couple of years (only went through one book which I wouldn’t really call a book), and was looking for the right moment to do my “comeback”. I picked up this book.

Just finished reading the book and I’m blown away. The storyline, the way it was laid down onto the paper, was simply beautiful. The details in the description made me imagine the environment, feel the pain of the characters. It made me think a lot, how we all in a way seek for someone’s validation, hurt others (and ourselves) with our actions/words, doubt in ourselves etc. 

I don’t know how to move on from this book...
Has anyone been in a similar situation after reading this book? 
Any suggestions what I could read next?
