datascience,"Hi I was wondering how data science experience from the federal government is seen by employers, especially by FAANG companies. I've recently seen some posts here saying that inexperience with product and business-side are some of the factors that prevent some candidates from moving forward. 

I know that the federal government, especially some 3-letter agencies work with a lot of unique data. However, an obvious consequence is that the data domain usually doesn't overlap with traditional data science problems a FAANG or tech startup company would face. 

So does this mean that data scientists from fed jobs (without prior experience with product/business data) will face an uphill battle? Or do most FAANG employers look favorably enough upon data science experience from specific federal agencies that it shouldn't be a concern?",Future private sector career prospects from government data scientist experience?,1602285965

datascience,"I've been working in an academic lab for 2 years and have a few more years of experience in R&amp;D at startups.  I've built infrastructure to process TBs of streaming data, apps to analyze and summarize data and built ML models (lots of regressions, clustering, graph theory... DL coming soon) as well as a few publications (science specific jounals, no ICML,  NEURIPS etc).  

Had onsites with 3 FAANG companies in the past year and the recruiters said that I just didn't have enough production experience.  Here's a quick breakdown of the roles and reasons for rejection

&amp;#x200B;

1. SWE-ML: Primarily SWE but implementing ML so must understand it, similar to MLE.  Recruiter said that the interviewer did not consider my experience ""ML"" (signal estimation, sparse graph modeling and disease state estimation aren't DL so maybe that's specifically what he meant?).  I could have done better on the algos too.  Said 50% lack of experience and 50% algo.
2. Data Scientist: Seemed more like an analyst position where you spend most of your time slicing data.  Recruiter said I just straight up didn't have enough product facing experience.   One of the interviewers said I didn't have enough ""Data Science"" skills, which may be true based on how they define a ""Data Scientist"".  I don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out why DAU's are down in some area... although, I spend most of my time combining through noisy data trying to find a link between disease states and sub patient signals which has a lot of data slicing and modeling so... wouldn't this transfer?
3. Data Scientist: Generalist DS position with a heavier software req.  Sort of like an applied scientist.  Recruiter said I just hadn't worked on any public facing products and the other candidates had.  Recommended I go get a few more years xp at tech startup with a product and reach back out.

Every recruiter said I did well on the leadership and culture fit questions and that the interviewers enjoyed talking to me.  I'm sure I could still improve these areas but it seems to not be the reason unless it's just easier to use a catch-all ""well, they lack xp"".  If it really is lack of production level experience and academia has no user product, how should I go about this? Here are my current ideas

&amp;#x200B;

1. Build a web app that showcases ML/DL algos implemented by hand.  Use a flask app to serve the algo and visitors to the site could select an algo and submit an image (i.e., for classification, maybe pick an AI Gym task for RL etc).  I would also have to be able to handle many users at once (or mock them).  This would showcase I can build a product, implement ML/DL (not just take something out of model zoo) and handle serving.
2. Contribute to open source.  This feels mostly like mostly swe.  Maybe there's an early stage ML project that I could add algo's they just haven't gotten to?
3. Take a job at a smaller company for a year? I don't necessarily need to work at a FAANG but I was primarily focused on them as ML is a big part of their products which means there's lots of different types of ML to do and plenty of mentorship.  I'm fine working anywhere that is ML heavy and hopefully pays more than what I currently make.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have ideas on how to get this xp? Anyone have a similar transition?

datascience,"# TL;DR

We are developing a personality test to help data scientists improve their competencies and collaborate more effectively with others. This is NOT a survey. We want to get your feedback on the design of [the questionnaire](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HOCZhalSXKepfYzqQQnQ4YHgTwypnayf/view?usp=sharing).

# Intent

As ex- [head of data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haochen85) and [lead data scientist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nima-taghipour-12106b8/), we notice a wide range of characteristics and preferences in how data scientists approach their work. In our experience, this leads to three practical implications:

1. The skills that can help them advance their careers the most are different for each person
2. Without knowing these differences, team members can misunderstand each other and get into unnecessary conflicts
3. Without knowing team member preferences, team leads have a harder time creating win-win situations

We have seen in our own teams how these points can make a huge difference in how fast data scientists grow and how much they enjoy their work. Therefore, we plan to design a test to map these characteristics into personality types, so that it can help data scientists:

1. Gain better knowledge about themselves
2. Gain more empathy for other data scientists
3. See new learning and development opportunities
4. Identify roles and responsibilities that are better fits for them

## Prior work

There are a few articles online about data scientist archetypes and personality types. However: 

1. They tend to mix skill levels with personal preferences, which makes it hard to come up with actionable ideas based on the results 
2. They are early concepts based on limited empirical observations, which makes them less reliable as an assessment tool

## Our approach

We are pragmatic problem solvers who also care deeply about scientific methods and first principles. That is why we are taking an iterative approach: 

1. Initial feedback (by Oct 13, 2020): get ad hoc feedback from data scientists
2. Prototype (Oct 16-30, 2020): gather small-scale data to assess reliability and validity.  Share the first findings and improve the test. Basic descriptions of each personality type.
3. Iteration one (Nov 2020): gather larger-scale data on LinkedIn and other platforms. Share second findings and improve the test. Detailed information on each personality type.
4. Further iterations in 2021: if the test is doing well, we will expand the framework further.

The personality test will remain free forever. We will regularly share the latest results online. 

## We would love your help

We are gathering initial feedback until Oct 13. We would really appreciate if you spend 6 minutes to go through [this draft questionnaire](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HOCZhalSXKepfYzqQQnQ4YHgTwypnayf/view?usp=sharing) and let us know what you think in the comments:

**Current Blue Zones research =** identify zones with a high concentration of older-than-average, healthy people. Interview and survey the population to extract habits and consumption behaviour associated with longevity.

**Issues =** bais against some communities (e.g. US Adventists accepted as a blue zone, when US Mormons achieve similar wellbeing scores, but were not looked at), poor/ obscure data (e.g. some Blue Zones proved to be falsely marked because of people just lying about their age) and bias against some consumption choices (e.g. meat consumption is largely dismissed, with the researchers declaring a preexisting focus on veganism).

Goal: given two teams of players, predict probability of team a beating team b.

Data:
- there are 60 players, not all players play in each match, not all matches have equal number of teams.

Method: purely personal project, not looking for any high level or betting level prediction, I just want it based off two simple premises, if a player wins a game they should be more likely to win, if a player lost a game, they should be less likely to win. Similar to ELO. 

Additionally I want to have it weight players, if rob and Tom are on the same team, this should impact the overall likeliness above just an average. (I have a base of this I used when learning go/python but wanted to try adding in a ML approach to compare against)

I started a new role and the company has a lot of their existing modeling done in SAS, but they want to move some of the models over into their new Python environment (CDSW). While future models I will write directly in Python, they are satisfied with the SAS models and simply want them moved into the new environment and have new observations run through these existing models each day. 

In Python, I would build a model and serialize using the pickle module so that the model could be stored and quickly retrieved as opposed to retrained each day. In this case, it’s a decision tree if that matters.

Rather than importing all the data sources, cleaning the data, and sifting through their pages of SAS code (it’s very messy), is there a way to just “pickle” the final model in SAS and save it as a binary file that could then have new observations predicted through it in Python?

Due to the recent political and economical situation in the country, an academic career is becoming something unrealistic for me, so I'm looking for a transition to industry (I never had internships or anything) and started researching about DS jobs. My main concern right now is if I'll be able to land a job when most of the relevant things I've done so far (i.e., published papers, computing software developed, conference prizes) seem to have no value for DS jobs, at least in Brazil.

As a reference, I've scraped the first 250 DS jobs in the LinkedIn search for Brazil and only 16% of the results had any mention to graduate studies keywords, while this number goes up to 72% in the US, for example. I've also noticed a lot of trash talking posts from DS people in LinkedIn towards people with academic background, which honestly discouraged me a lot.

Although I have only academic experience formally, I know Python, a lot of R (wrote a couple packages such as API wrappers, a ggplot extension and a ML framework for a very niche model I use in my research and contributed to many others), SQL, C++ and most of the stuff that are listed in jobs. I also learn web dev stuff for fun on my free time and even started a couple projects which I never deployed because I was afraid of messing up on GCP/AWS and spend money I just can't right now.

My questions are: 
  
* Are the 6 years of a MsC + PhD developing research skills really no use in the field?   
* What else can I do in this last years to increase my chances? 
* Are entry-position DS jobs in other countries something I could consider? Does someone coming from out of the US / Europe realistically have chances in these places?

**Personal info omitted**

**COMPUTER SCIENCE INTERN APPLICANT**

I am a computer science student seeking internship or full-time position in Data Science, especially regarding applied statistics. Currently, I am on track to complete my Computer Science degree early within 3.5 years and am proficient in multiple programming languages as well as soft communication skills.

**EDUCATION:** 

**Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** *expected to graduate in December 2020*

*US RANDOM UNIVERSITY*

Cumulative GPA: 3.76

*Winner of US UNIVERSITY Merit Full Tuition Scholarship*

**RELEVANT LANGUAGE/SKILLS****:**

Python (NumPY / Pandas / Skitlearn / Matplotlib / Pandas)

*Other Skills*: Excel / SQL / Experience with Applied Programming Interface (API)

**OUTSIDE EXPERIENCE:**

**Data Science Intern at Texas Surgical Dermatology P.A. (Summer 2018)**

\-Used descriptive statistics to determine which factors improved patient satisfaction. For instance, I determined that allowing returning patients to choose the nurse of their previous visit led to greater satisfaction scores. After sharing this and other results with the head doctor, I caused a 5% increase in overall patient satisfaction.

\-Communicated with nurses, physician’s assistant, and head doctor during weekly meetings to display findings.

**PROJECTS/COMPETITIONS:**

**Linear Regression Model using data obtained from Reddit API**

Applied the Python’s Skitlearn built-in Linear Regression template analyzing the number of “upvotes” correlated with the price of a watch. This was an independent project to reveal “watch elitism” within the community. In conclusion, there was a weak positive correlation, but an F-test proved that the model was statistically significant.

**Comparing Ratings Between Users of Chess Websites to Official Tournament Ratings**

Compared online Lichess and Chess.com Classical Ratings of users to the users’ respective FIDE (International Chess Federation) rating to determine how representative the online ratings were of the official ones. The method used was a two sample Z-test (alpha = 5%) and showed that online ratings were fairly representative of their FIDE counterparts but Lichess typically slightly overestimated.

**3rd place SQL Knowledge Competition at US University Artificial Intelligence Club (2019)**

datascience,"I am a semi-recent college grad (BS Physics, class of 2019) working in an analytical modeling role at a healthcare company. I'd say my job is 75% data engineering, 20% ad hoc analysis, and 5% modeling but I do want to transition into a more data science based role. 

I've been toying with the idea of (re) applying for an astronomy PhD program (background: I worked in an astronomy lab for 3 years during undergrad and am very versed in the academic process) because

1. It's been a personal goal of mine to receive one (biggest reason)

2. If academic life doesn't work out, then having that PhD opens doors into the data science positions

But I'm at a crossroads, say I don't get into a PhD program is a masters in data science/analytics enough to get into those positions? My company will reimburse up to ~$10K/yr for advanced education and I know of UT Austin's online masters program for analytics/data science. So the backup plan would be to apply to that and hopefully get into that program.

I’ve been asked to do part-time consulting work (basic bioinformatics tasks).  It’s all stuff I have experience with; I’ve an early-mid career bioinformatician (10+ yrs experience in statistics/epidemiology, 4 yrs in bioinformatics).  I’ve never done bioinformatics consulting before and I also have a history of under-valuing myself.  I’m also quite seriously under-employed right now, working with a government agency at an hourly rate of $28/hr.  I’ve seen that consulting rates should be 2-3x your hourly FTE rate. That translates to $56-84/hr, but what I’ve yet to see anyone quote &lt;$100/hr on here. I don’t know what to do. If I say $84/hr people might think I’m “not that good” compared to those asking $200+/hr when in reality I am skilled it’s just that I was hired as a contractor for a government health agency and they underpay everyone.  Any suggestions about this would be welcome!!! 

As an aside, I will take all your advice as basic career skills advice as I look for better full-time employment as well. No one around me talks salary; it’s very hard for me to know “what I’m worth.”  I guess I’m not Google material...I’m not some kind of computer maverick...but on the other hand, I know hardly any bioinformaticians who understand epidemiology and statistics concepts that are actually really important to the work that we do. So, I occupy a niche.

datascience,"Hello,

It's a bit of a rant here because I couldnt complain outloud and had instead to thank every single person I interacted with for this ""great learning opportunity"" because who knows what opportunities it might lead to. But, to be honest, while it wasnt that bad, I am a bit concerned...

Context : I had a paid summer internship this year (penultimate year of master). The pay was the minimum allowed by my country and it was a remote internship so in the context of covid-19, I couldnt really cancel it despite knowing the drawbacks.

The internship was offered to statistics students. This internship was one in which I had to build an app using Python-Dash and use it to visualise data. There was also a couple of statistical tests that were used to notice abnormalities.

Now, I am not saying I did nothing but it was really far from master level statistics and the only real reason they got someone from a stat school to do it was because of the statistical tests but to be honest... they could just pick up a bachelor level stats or dev student and have him learn what he was lacking.

This led to a situation where I learnt absolutely nothing. Sure, I had to interact with people to build the app they needed but it doesnt mean I needed an internship to do that... I am a fairly extroverted person and I can totally communicate and keep in touch with people to make sure I am building the thing they are asking for without needing any internship. (I acted professionally and they seemed fairly satisfied of both the result and the process.)

I wish I had instead had the opportunity to work on some statistical models but it clearly wasnt the priority. While I could ""take advantage"" of the internship to do it, it would have been unprofessional as it clearly wasnt what the user needed in priority. 

Now, this isnt that big of a deal, but now I am really scared of ending up in a similar place where the most ""technical"" thing I can do is a logistical model. For my coworkers, it was their reality and they appreciated it. 

I am not ""afraid"" in the sense that it's bad (after all you get paid for doing something rather easy) but rather that it would lead to stagnation.

This is especially true considering the unlimited amount of things I believe I have yet to learn that I cant use yet (ULMfit for instance) or other arxiv papers applications.

datascience,"Hi there! How do you all usually find good datasets to work with or augment other datasets with? Is there anything about that process that you wish was improved?

We're a couple of amateur data scientists/machine learning students currently working on a tool to try to make it easier to find relevant tabular datasets, by searching by lat/long, date/time, and hopefully other joinable column types in the future (I'd really like to do named entity joins so you could do crazier things like join imagenet images to wikipedia articles for crazy multimodal modeling, but that's going to be... hard).

We're basically trying to make it possible to:
* search for datasets that are joinable to your dataframe and have significant overlap (if your data is all about Boston, there's no point scrolling through 1,000 NYC datasets)
* download the parts/rows that match your data, delivered as a pandas dataframe, to avoid any CSV munging 
* within your notebook, via a python library

I think NOAA's general summary of the day dataset had 10s of thousands of CSVs in each of a bunch of folders to massage and combine. That was stupid. And the 2010 US decennial census, holy crap. The PDF docs about the file format was multiple hundreds of pages. There's no reason every user of this data should have to repeat that work.

We've been hacking on the fun crunchy challenges this involves for a bit, but we realized that we never really bothered to check to see if anyone else wanted something like this. Does this sound like something you might be interested in?

If so, any requests for public datasets that would be be useful? So far we just have a few from NOAA, EPA, Census, USGS, and some other public orgs. 

Could you see yourself exploring datasets using a python library and interpreter/notebook, or do you think you'd rather mostly do that on a website? Could you see yourself ever uploading a dataset to a public searchable repository of datasets? Anything you'd be particularly concerned about when doing so, like licenses?

And if this all seems stupid, we'd love to hear why it's a stupid idea.

1) My understanding is that the probability threshold over here is essentially being treated as a hyperparameter, which is tuned for different values and ultimately cross validated. Is this a correct interpretation?

2) I am slightly confused as to why this code begins with taking a ""training set"" instead of using the whole data. 

As explained here:
 http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/38-regression-model-validation/157-cross-validation-essentials-in-r

It seems that when you use repeatedcv, there is no need hard split the data into training and test ... rather the whole data is periodically used for training and testing.

I am trying to analyze auto claims narrative documents which contain description about the accident usually free text written by claims executives. Is there a nlp technique I could use to identify cause of loss like : drunk and driving , negligence , bad weather , etc ?

I have used TF-IDF technique to rank order words per claim but it does really help to identify the exact cause of loss easily even if I concentrate on top 20% words. I am aware of word embedding but really not sure if they could help . Any help is appreciated.",Text Analysis : Recommendation to identify cause of loss from claim narrative documents,1602120346
datascience,"Hey folks!

So, i'm pretty sure my question may sound simple, but it's been troubling me for the last couple of days.

My company uses GCP a lot, specially Big Query. I used to run supermetrics to export some queries to google sheets, but now we won't be allowed to use it anymore, so excel will be the only spreadsheet software allowed (something related to corporate standardization). However, I still need that data exported to excel, but my budget for that is $0, because finance don't want to pay for another tools at the moment;

So, is there any way to export the result of about 15-20 queries a day to excel without using any paid tool and without running all those queries one by one?

Even a simple answer that could lead me to the right path would be great.

Thanks a lot folks!",Exporting Big Query queries to a spreadsheet,1602119934
