books,"I'm not trying to start a debate right now, but to try and research what I believe about fiction and perhaps uncover WHY I believe them. 

1. Is there a term for a belief that the point of fiction is to present truths, and these truths may or may not be by the conscious effort of the writer? In fact, some of the most profound truths in fiction were not the intent of the author.

2, Is there a term for a belief that fictional worlds have a logic all their own which even the author is powerless to change unless they completely derail whatever power the story has? The best example off the top of my head is Lucas' ideas for both the Whills (Force feeders) and the midichlorians in Star Wars, although one was never implemented and the other doesn't quite break the story, though it comes VERY close.

3. Is there a term for believing that while fictional worlds don't exist, they represent worlds and people that COULD exist at least the good ones, and thus the author cannot do whatever the hell they please? This might be the same thing as 2, but maybe not quite/

4. Is there a term for the belief that an author can flat out be WRONG about details of the world they have ""created""? It's not Death of the Author, because that's about interpretation, but rather something more like the author creates a plot hole everyone sees, and there's something lacking or misplaced in the worldbuilding that by its nature must be changed for the work to make sense? In this case, there IS a correct interpretation but it's not the author's or not totaly the authors. 

5. In the philosophy of Philistinism, I have come to believe that that are actually three orders of Philistines, not just the one that simply depside art as a waste of time. 


The second is the one that actively participates in art but undervalues it. This is the type who says ""It's just a game/movie/book/story"" despite being a nominal fan. The type of person who regards everything as an evening's entertainment rather than a touchstone of universal truths. 


Then there are the third order, ""creators"" who see the work as merely self-expression, a vehicle for financial gain, or propounding ideological vision, The ""repurposers"" of Doctor Who, Star Trek, Star Wars, and even Michael Bay, who are so hated by their fandoms are the chief example in our time, but I'd argue that even Robert Heinlein was this kind of third-order philistine, and his works, especially Starship Troopers are hobbled by them being expressions of ideology rather than examinations thereof.
 

These stories do not have an existence of their own, nor do the characters, they are not organic nor developed organically, but only serve the whims and visions of the authors. They are tools of expression and do not exist for their own sake and on their own terms. 

I admit this thought might be underdeveloped so being able to read the thoughts of those who have given this concept thought would do well on me. Are there links I might make use of, even if it to disabuse me of this thinking?

So is Shasta manipulative? That might put her actions later in the novel in a different light, for example prodding Doc with the ‘Manson chick’ thing after meeting Penny.

The Institute gave me a similar feel to IT as it features a strong cast of young protagonists, I found Luke Ellis to be engaging but it is Avery Dixon that really steals the show for me, facing off against a big bad but still feels new and original.   The writing as is standard for a king novel is tight and propels the reader at a pace that makes it hard to put the book down.

I only started with the book, but I have a strong impression that Charlie is a perfect guy with a perfect family and perfect friends especially compared to everything that was going on in my teens. And I'll give you some examples of that.

First, when he encounters a bully for the first time, he easily beats him up, because he obviously knows how to fight. He has a brother who is in the process of becoming a future football star, and who taught him all these punches and kicks so now Charlie can stand for himself. I was a coward in bad physical shape who didn't know anything about fights. I would lose to anybody in my school and people bullied me all the time. Nothing changed since then, except that in adult life nobody cares about anybody, so bullies disappeared just because I don't need to go to school anymore. 

Charlie's family would watch a tv show together and cry at the end, can you imagine it? I never had such experience with my family. But my father regularly reminded me that I'm a weak stupid coward who hasn't achieved anything in his life.

He's already got supportive friends who can give him life advice and with whom he can hang out.  I didn't have any friends at school and barely have any nowadays.

He doesn't look at porn pictures because he just doesn't like doing it. You guessed it, I have a porn addiction that I developed in my teens, and I still struggle with overcoming it.

I'm a whining idiot, I hope everyone already understands that by reading my post.

&amp;#x200B;

 \&gt; Since he belonged, even at the age of six, to that great clan which cannot keep this feeling separate from that, but must let future prospects, with their joys and sorrow, cloud what is actually at hand, since to such people even in earliest childhood any turn in the wheel of sensation has the power to crystallise and transfix the moment upon which its gloom or radiance rests, James Ramsay, sitting on the floor cutting out pictures from the illustrated catalogue of the Army and Navy stores, endowed the picture of a refrigerator, as his mother spoke, with heavenly bliss. It was fringed with joy. \*\*The wheelbarrow, the lawnmower, the sound of poplar trees, leaves whitening before rain, rooks cawing, brooms knocking, dresses rustling--all these were so coloured and distinguished in his mind that he had already his private code, his secret language, though he appeared the image of severity, with his high forehead and fierce blue eyes, impeccably candid and pure, frowning slightly at the sight of human frailty . . . .\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

The first two sentences make enough sense: James Ramsay has just gotten good news from his mother about tomorrow, and since he's of the 'great clan' Woolf describes, he let's the joy of future prospects bleed into his present experience of cutting the catalog. (But: Woolf blends (a) inability to keep emotions separate, (b) letting future prospects color present experience, and (c) one or both of these processes resulting in the crystallization of a moment, the cementing into memory. (b) implies (a), but otherwise these three things seem pretty independent to me.) 

&amp;#x200B;

But then what does the next sentence mean? At first, I thought it might be describing other things he is experiencing at the moment, that his endowing the present moment with this joy borrowed from the future brought all these elements into sharper focus, gave them as much significance as the photo of the refrigerator. But then why say they were 'so coloured and distinguished in his mind that he had already his private code, his secret language'? What does that mean? If these elements of his experience gain significance via joy borrowed from the future, it's not \*linguistic\* significance. I mean, Woolf can't expect us to believe that the wheelbarrow signifies something different than the lawnmower, and that these elements of experience could be used to \*communicate\* or anything like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does that mean it's wrong to interpret the first part of the sentence as being about endowing elements of the current experience with something extra a la the picture of the fridge? (After all, it doesn't seem very true to experience. I agree that feeling excited or hopeful or anxious about the future colors the present moment, but it doesn't make me more aware of details in my environment like the ones Woolf lists. If anything, it makes me less aware because my mind's not there--it's off thinking about the future.) Or is there some way to keep that interpretation but fit it with this weird comment about secret languages? (Am I the only one that finds the ""kids having secret languages trope"" unconvincing and annoying?) 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, the next part of the sentence starts with 'though'--it's supposed to draw a contrast. But what's the contrast supposed to be between having a secret language and being severe? I really can't think of any relevant contrast.

I would really appreciate some help understanding this sentence. It feels bad to be stumped so early in the novel.",Woolf - To The Lighthouse: Help me understand a sentence,1583748997
books,"I was looking at my shelves and feeling a bit too pleased with my collection: 700 books in beautiful shelves, organized chronologically; as I run my fingers along the spines of my books, it feels like my fingers are tracing the leaves of time. I really like that. I read all these books (I keep my reference books and books didn't read in my office), and they tell as much about the history of literature and ideas as about my own.

&amp;#x200B;

Amidst all that self-satisfaction, I noticed that I only own five books written by women:

&amp;#x200B;

*Sappho* \- Sappho

*Obras Completas* \- Juana Inés de la Cruz

*The Tale of Genji* \- Murasaki Shikibu

*The Waves* \- Virginia Woolf

 *The Origins of Totalitarianism* \- Hannah Arendt

&amp;#x200B;

I read other women, of course, but I never decided, for whatever reason, to add those authors to my collection. I wonder if my education has something to do with that.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to all-boys boarding school and that means I had very little contact with women until college. I studied agronomic engineering and played rugby in college, so the contact with women was still very limited. I'm also gay and the little social life I had was spent with other guys in bars that only men frequented. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm quite aloof as it is, but I can't help thinking that my education molded the way I relate to women and the way I read. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have similar experiences?
