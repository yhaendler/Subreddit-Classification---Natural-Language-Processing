datascience,"Hi, I’m reaching out to you guys in a time of need. I’m still an undergrad (at USC), but I’m about to enter what is essentially a 4+1 program for my master’s, and I’m seriously torn between these two programs — at this point, I can essentially still freely decide which one I want to pursue. If anyone with more industry experience could possibly take a look at these programs / maybe skim syllabuses and let me know what should inform my decision, I’d be so grateful. 

My general sense from the two is that they’re ~70% similar. As for the other 30%, I get the impression that the Applied Data Science program is more technological-training-intensive, while the Analytics program provides more business applications and theoretical background, while being slightly less technologically intense.

I see myself more going into applying data science in a business/operations research type capacity, but I also don’t want to possibly pigeon-hole myself by choosing Analytics, especially since my undergrad is in Industrial Engineering, so I do already have a lot of exposure to some of those topics.

I don’t even know those languages but I’m willing to learn.  Beyond that I am in my first analyst (sorta) position ever. 

I say sorta because it doesn’t use many tools other than excel and fox pro (SQL?) to manipulate data. 

Basically we get data from different sources and either use excel or fox pro to clean and manipulate the data. We use a program written for fox pro (idk if it’s written in SQL coding) and it basically runs calculations based on the data we uploaded and spits out the calculators in a text file. 

Then we take the calculations and enter the data into tables with formulas in excel and it generates results in other tables and graphs  in other tabs in excel.

I’ve been curious to find out more about their backgrounds and listen to them describe what it is that they do on a day to day basis.

The number one benefit of doing this has been that I’ve been exposed to a variety of new industries, roles, and opportunities.

I’ve learnt about *why* people have made certain career transitions, how they’ve successfully learnt new skills, and what advice they have for others hoping to do the same.

All I’ve been basically doing is going on coffee chats (over Zoom, of course). And sharing them with everyone on the internet.

Here's what I've learnt so far &amp; I hope you can also leverage coffee chats to advance your data science career.

**What is a Coffee Chat?**

A coffee chat is an informational interview where you find out more about a person’s professional experience and goals.

If there’s only one thing you get from this article, it should be the following: a coffee chat is not a place for you to ask for a job. It may certainly help you land a role in the future (and I’ll talk about this later), but if you’re going into a coffee chat with the sole intent of asking for a job, you’re doing it wrong.

Instead, a good coffee chat’s primary purpose should be to build trust and for both individuals to get to know each other.

**Why You Should Do Coffee Chats**

An obvious reason to go on more coffee chats is to increase your future chances of getting the role you want.

So assuming you want to work at Twitter on their Data Science team, you could go reach out to a data scientist there and speak with them for 30min. Assuming the conversation goes well, you can continue to follow up and stay in touch for a few months.

Then, say a year later, when you apply for a new data scientist role at Twitter, you can get referred, and sometimes you can even skip the whole line and directly meet with the hiring manager.

Another reason to go on a coffee chat is to find out about what a particular job role or industry consists of and to get information on how to break in. Here, you again reach out to someone who’s knowledgeable in a field and then ask them questions regarding what it is that they do.

So for example, let’s say I want to make a career transition into data science. I browse the data science subreddit and read a bunch of how-to posts and come across someone who’s written about their experience transitioning from biology to data science.

I decide that this person can give me useful tips so I send them an email and end up going on a coffee chat with them. This way, I can get direct advice from someone who’s done what I want to do.

If you’re reaching out to someone to ask for a job, you’re not asking for a coffee chat - you’re just asking for an interview. And that’s very different.

**How To Reach Out**

I recommend reaching out via email over Linkedin or Twitter. Everybody checks their email, even if they might not reply to you.

When sending an email to someone you want to go on a coffee chat with, keep it short and be specific. There’s probably a particular reason why you decided to reach out to someone - be sure to mention it in your email.

Here's an example:

***Email*** ***Example:***

In my senior year of college, I wanted to get a job in tech. As an international student, I had to get sponsorship and this was quite a big issue - I wanted to chat with someone who had been through this process before.

I came across Jay's Linkedin profile and realized that he was an international student who also had a similar economics related background to me ([link to image](https://www.careerfair.io/assets_coffee_chat/Jay_Linkedin_Profile_1.png)) and had also gotten a job in tech ([link to image](https://www.careerfair.io/assets_coffee_chat/Jay_v2.png)).

So when I reached out to him by email, I made sure to mention these things:

**-------**

*""Hey Jay,*

*International student from Cal, came across your profile - congrats on the job!*

*Wanted to chat about your experience recruiting in tech. Specifically, wanted to ask about:*

1. *How you bring up sponsorship with employers (at what stage, how you frame it etc)*
2. *Your econ background &amp; how this has affected the type of roles you've looked at.*

*Let me know if a quick 20min chat this week would be possible.""*

**--------**

Notice how I didn’t say something generic like: “Would love to pick your brain”

Being specific when reaching out also makes sure that the recipient doesn’t think you’re randomly spamming people and sending the exact same copy to hundreds of people. You’re much more likely to get a response.

Finally, realize that the worst thing that happens is someone says no or doesn’t reply. No big deal, you’re still alive. Realize that most people will ignore your email. That’s okay.

And no, you’re not being “pushy” if you choose to follow-up. Just make sure you’ve taken the steps above to write a good message.

Okay, so let’s assume you’ve got someone to respond and they’re down to have a coffee chat with you. How do you prepare?

**How To Prepare**

Well, firstly, make sure *you do* prepare in advance. Someone’s given you their most valuable asset: their time. Don’t waste it.

When I’m about to speak with someone, I spend a minimum of 1 hour going through their profile and drafting up questions I want to ask them.

I’ll look at their Linkedin profile, see if they’ve published any blog posts, or if they’ve previously spoken on any panels. I’ll compile my notes in a google doc.

If the conversation is going well, you’ll find yourself asking a lot less questions and having a more two-way discussion, but I still recommend doing your research upfront.

When preparing questions, don’t just ask questions you could have looked up. Try to go a layer deeper - so instead of merely asking “Why did you transition into X?”, ask “Given your background in Y, what appealed you to X? Am I right in thinking that given my interests in A &amp; B, I’ll also benefit from a transition into X?”

Ultimately, though, your questions don’t need to be perfect. A coffee chat is just a conversation with another person. And as long as you’re genuinely interested in finding out about their professional journey (rather than begging for a job), you’ll come across well.

**Guiding the Conversation and Asking Questions**

As I hinted at in the last section, whilst you should have a bank of questions to rely on, you don’t want the conversation to just be a series of questions and answers.

Instead, use your questions to add structure to your overall conversation, but let the discussion itself ebb and flow. Go on tangents - if something the other person says catches your interest, don’t be afraid to ask them about it.

There is no script and there shouldn’t be.

Keep in mind, though, that your first few coffee chats *will* likely involve just a bunch of questions and answers. But as you go on more and get more practice, just like anything else, you’ll develop a habit of steering the conversation in a manner that doesn’t involve just Q&amp;A.

Finally, I also recommend taking notes - not necessarily to remember what you discussed, but rather as a tool to highlight the important parts of your conversation and to internalize some of your learnings better.

**Final Thoughts**

Congrats, you’ve just made a new friend!

I recommend following up once right after your chat and sending a nice thank-you note.

Then, in the coming months, if you work on something cool or explore any new opportunities that are related to what you discussed, make sure to let them know!

As a slight tangent - you might be surprised at how many people end up reaching out to *you.*

After one of my coffee chats, I got a recruiter from one of the people I interviewed's company reaching out to me asking if I was interested in a new role they had.

Going on coffee chats is one of the best ways to increase future opportunities that come your way.

All they take is a bit of outreach and prep. And I hope this guide has proven to be a helpful start.

He recruited two groups of participants. 30 who engaged in an hour or more of aerobic exercise daily and 30 who did not engage in any aerobic exercise. He administered a valid mental health inventory to all and found lower scores(e.g lower mental health) in the sedentary group. He concluded that exercise had a positive effect on mental health.

datascience,"Hey there, 

I am currently studying in a Data Science related field as an undergraduate. I have recently been offered to study Mechanical Engineering Master's degree while working as a TA (teaching assistant). 

Which brings me to the reason why I need your advice. This is a big opportunity for me as the tuition and fees will be fully waived and I  will get paid monthly. I am currently in a different country from where I'll be studying the master's degree. So, that is what it makes this decision very important for me. 

I have high interest in data related fields and want to build up my career based on them. But on the other hand, this opportunity would let me live in Canada and get work permit after the graduation. Considering the budget cuts due to COVID and hardness to get a TA as a master's student (faculties tend to choose doctoral students for the TA positions), this really sounds promising. However, taking it would make me study in a field which I am not really a fan of.

Hope you guys can show me some windows that I have not been able to see.",Need some advice related to master's degree,1608218981

datascience,"My current workflow is as follows:

1) Open an Excel file and write down the first topic I want to understand (eg. the shape of the sample distribution of some indicator)

2) Type SQL in DBeaver to query the data.

3) Export the data to clipboard and paste it into a new sheet in Excel

4) In Excel, visually filter the data, remove outliers, filter on some variables to remove irrelevant data.

5) Create a chart based on data. Find it unusable, for example because the histogram bin size is wrong, or because I have to focus on some part of data to see more details, etc. Tweak the chart and the data filtering and sometimes add additional calculated columns to the data (like ratios instead of absolute values) to be able to see the result clearly.

6) Say ""aha!"", write down the insights in Excel (if any), and formulate the next topic based on what I've seen. Repeat the loop from point 1.

I've chosen these tools instead of for example using Jupyter notebooks or RStudio, because I'm more efficient doing points 4 and 5 in Excel rather than programming them in SQL, Python or R. Still, I'm not very happy with it, because of the following two problems:

\- If I need to repeat the whole data mining with another set of data, I can't just rerun something, because the steps 4 and 5 and manual and won't be scripted.

\- If you include Markdown in your Notebook, it is easier to create a shareable Data Mining result in just one click.

datascience,"I'm working for a large multinational corporation (but with a very small team and a poor IT architecture) and have a focus in customer analytics (predictive modelling, segmentation, automation of reporting and processes, data flows). My focus, in particular, has largely been confined to backend processes with occasional reporting needs.

The company is looking to adopt dashboards (primary data source would be multiple different SQL databases) for reporting purposes, but the installation of software might serve as a barrier to some of the leadership team. Previously for dashboarding needs I've used Tableau, Spotfire, and Power BI, and can quickly pick these up again, but my worry is that they would be poorly adopted due to the need to install software. The company has investigated a cloud-based tool to allow for dashboarding, but the reporting capabilities are totally insufficient for some of the complex reporting that the business requires and the volume of data.

I'm investigating different solutions, and previously in a FinTech project I've worked on we had developed dashboards using D3 as part of a web application  and the results were very positive and I've seen it suggested increasingly often as a potential Data Vis avenue, so I'm considering this as possibility but uncertain on how the visualisations would be shared which I'm hoping somebody could give some insight into? 

My current assumption is D3 solutions would need to be embedded in a self-developed web app, which would potentially require a decent amount of development time, and then would be potentially risky in exposing data? Does anybody know if D3 is the way to go, or if an alternative would be better? The end-user of the dashboards would be people with very limited technical knowledge or experience so any requirement for additional software the end-user would need to install is a solution which won't be viable.",D3 Dashboarding Solutions or Alternative?,1608211172
