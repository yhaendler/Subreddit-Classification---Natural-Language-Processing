I'm now looking to update my resume to reflect this work, but I don't know what the proper terminology for the work I did is, or how to properly describe my work on my resume. 


Throughout my time I: 

* Built systems to pull data from different databases then combined, summarized, analyzed, filtered, and displayed this data such that the campaign's volunteers could use it. The ""backend"" was built in R using DPLYR, and whatever API's I needed to pull data. The ""frontend"" was primarily hosted in Google Sheets/Docs, as this is a relatively flexible, easy to use, and very fast to configure medium. 

* Linked Google form responses/sheets to concatenate and filter responses. I built search functions using the built-in Query/SQL methods that Sheets provide. 

* More general querying of data to create text/phone lists

I'm currently working in data analytics where I have become quite proficient in R, SQL, and Tableau.

I also love the idea that something that I build can be intellectually stimulating for me, as well as useful for others.

In the next 6 or 7 months, I would like to transition from my current role as an analyst to something more data science-y.

The middle ground of course is to develop machine learning Shiny apps; but my issue is that my non-work time is very limited, so I want to be sure to use it in a targeted way. 

I guess I'm wondering what sort of job prospects there are for a job as a full-time Shiny developer?

datascience,"Hello everyone,

I am a 32 years old economics grad, working in a local bank in Turkey as an internal auditor (for about 5 years). Next year (in September 2021) I am going to do a Master’s degree in Data Science/Analytics field in one of the universities located in the UK.

My main motivation to do a postgraduate study in the UK is to try to find a job and settle in the UK afterwards. After doing some research about the data science related programmes offered by the UK universities and checking their QS rankings, I have made a dozen of applications to the universities which I considered myself fit regarding their entry requirements.

Here’s the list of the universities and the names of the programmes that I have been offered a place so far:

Queen Mary UL – Data Analytics  
University of Exeter – Applied Data Science and Statistics  
University of Aberdeen – Data Science  
University of Sussex – Human and Social Data Science  
University of Sheffield – Data Science  
University of Salford – Data Science  
Brunel University – Data Science and Analytics  
Oxford Brookes University – Data Analytics  
Loughborough University – Data Science  
University of Manchester – Data Science (Social Analytics) – (hasn’t been admitted to this yet but I am hopeful for a positive response)

The question which I beg for your opinion is, which one of the universities above would be a wise choice for a guy like me whose only concern is to find a job and settle in the UK afterwards. Therefore, at the moment I am more concerned about the employment opportunities and the reputation of the universities than the content of the programmes. 

London seems to be one step ahead, considering the opportunities in the finance market. Cost of living is the only downside though. But I feel like its a burden that I have to bear for accessing to the job market. What do you think?

p.s. : I am awarded a nice scholarship which covers the tuition fee and living expenses (EUR 1.400 per month) for 12 months. Therefore, the crazy tuition fees of the UK universities is not a relevant parameter.

p.s. 2: Because of my social sciences background, I don’t meet the entry requirements of data science related programs of other top tier UK universities like LSE, UCL, Imperial, King’s College etc.

p.s. 3: Although I do not work in the AML/Compliance department, I hold a CAMS certificate and have some knowledge about the field.",Advice on MSc Data Science in the UK,1605307192

I've been really interested in the recent trend of [low/no code tools into the ML space](https://link.medium.com/tLkr0Z91Yab).

A friend and I have been working on a concept that allows you to upload a Tensorflow or Pytorch model that you've already built, and then the tool would automatically deploy this model to an API endpoint on the cloud for inference.

Before we set out to fully build it, do you think a tool like this be useful for you? I know everyone on this sub is at a different point on their DS/ML learning curve and has different skillsets.

**One side**: I've been doing SQL analyst grunt work for the past two years, telling marketing people what they want to know. I don't care about marketing or how profitable the company is. But there's something fun about the research and discovery aspect of it. 

**The other**: Before I got into data, I did 10 years in finance IT, so I'm strong on tech skills. So DE sounds fun, building ETLs, infrastructure, working with AWS, etc. Sooooo many jobs and great pay.

But I kind of lean towards analysis, like to script, want to do more data viz, and eventually want to do more machine learning. As I've searched, I found there are some jobs out there that do it all. 

Tomorrow I have a long second round interview for such a job, and it sounds exciting to me. It's a ""data engineer"" title but not focused on ETLs - needs to work with the DS team a lot. Very multifaceted.

Hi everyone, so I’m a recent graduate who works in the healthcare industry doing some covid related response. I’ve always been interested in DS but regretfully never studied much of it while in college. I’m committed to applying to MS programs in DS (a grad program at my alma mater intended for ‘career switch’ type situations) but I have minimal experience. I love my role working in healthcare but the industry severely lacks innovative tech and software. I would love nothing more than to help build and update the industry programs etc (a bold feat yes, but ya know—big ideas small steps). How can I gain more experience in DS with little existing experience to think of already. 

I would be more than willing to do part time internships etc but those require experience or even worse they require you to be a student (which I am no longer sadly)

datascience,"Lurker, first-time poster. Biology Ph.D. with a hint of computational biology. 2 years as a data sci in a startup. Just a super quick background: was given bioinformatics clients for a good chunk of this time, no ML, no NLP, no Deep Learning, or even non-bioinformatics-related data science. 

I kept studying on the side. Courses, workshops, and mini-projects what have you. Let's take a more specific example here: I have used sklearn's ML pkgs on multiple occasions and I have written models that answer specific scientific questions but it has all been under wraps and with clean Kaggle data. Anyway, even at the end of 2020 thanks to WFH, I took some live workshops in hopes of feeling more comfortable with what other people do. And learned from some more resources.

However, every time the manager says, we need an ML person on this project, I don't feel ready. I still feel so uneasy when someone mentions 'machine learning expertise' or 'machine learning experience' or requires knowledge of PyTorch or NLP experience. When in fact I have touched all these for 1-2 projects this year. Even when I have explained my experience on my resume, I shy away from job postings that ask this. I don't feel ready or prepared or confident. One thing that seems to a great fallback excuse is that I have never had formal training in these areas and everything is self-taught. I am not a perfectionist but then again this is the first time I have taken self-teaching to this scale. 

I have also made my manager aware of all of the coursework I have taken and all that I know, but when it comes to client-facing work, they also want to go for the more experienced folks.
