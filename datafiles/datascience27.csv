A little bit about myself: have a BS and MS in biomedical engineering. Completed the MS online part-time while working at my first job. Been in industry for about 3 years now, 2 years with a large pharmaceutical doing change management/quality work and about a year now with the DoD doing electrical/software engineering work unrelated to health. Will be transitioning next month to become a software engineer at a big bank.

I had been applying to lots of biomedical data science roles while at my first job with no success. I ultimately decided to lateral to a different industry doing software engineering in hopes of increasing my skillset/attractiveness as a candidate to the jobs I wanted later.

My ultimate goal within the next 3-4 years is to work in a healthtech/research organization with biosignals (EMG, ECG, EEG, EOG, etc.). My dream job would look something like this posting here from Pfizer: [https://pfizer.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/PfizerCareers/job/United-States---Massachusetts---Cambridge/Digital-Health-Data-Scientist\_4780859?](https://pfizer.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/PfizerCareers/job/United-States---Massachusetts---Cambridge/Digital-Health-Data-Scientist_4780859?source=linkedin). I have worked with biosignals in the past, mainly ECG and EMG in academic settings or personal projects, but have been unable to translate this into a job in the field.

My plan was to obtain another Masters in Computer Science in order to fill the gaps in my knowledge with regards to programming/computer systems. I figured another Masters in something like Biomedical Data Science would look redundant with my MS in Biomedical Engineering. My question is if this seems like a good plan; should I be looking possibly into PhD programs, different MS programs, etc. Is my erratic work history a deterrent?

Since I have no experience with interviewing with big firms, how much time should I give myself to study? Is 3 to 4 weeks reasonable or would that piss them off and make them question me as a candidate?

There will be questions on ML model I worked on, model evaluation, and stats theory on probability and a problem solving question where I will have to explain my thought process of building a model for a given case.

I have a masters degree in statistics, have 12+ years of experience in statistical data analysis and 6+ in Machine Learning. I've built production machine learning models for 3 FAANG companies and have presented my work in various industry conferences. It's not to brag, but to tell you that I have actual industry experience. And despite all this, I wouldn't dare call myself an ""AI Expert"", let alone ""AI practitioner"".

I recently came across someone on LinkedIn through someone I follow and they claim they are the ""Forbes AI Innovator of the Year"" (if you know, you know). The only reference I find to this is an interview on a YouTube channel of a weird website that is handing out awards like ""AI Innovator of the Year"".

Their twitter, medium and LinkedIn all have 10s of thousands of followers, each effusing praise on how amazing it is that they are making AI accessible. Their videos, tweets, and LinkedIn posts are just some well packaged b-school bullshit with a bunch of buzzwords. 

I see many people following them and asking for advice to break into the field and they're just freely handing them away. Most of it is just platitudes like - *believe in yourself, everyone can learn AI, etc.*

I actually searched on forbes for ""AI Innovator of the Year"" and couldn't find any mention of this person. Forbes does give out awards for innovations in AI, but they seem to be for actual products and startups focused on AI (none of which this person is a part of).

On one hand, I want to bust their bullshit and call them out on it fairly publicly. On the other hand, I don't want to stir unnecessary drama on Twitter/LinkedIn, especially because they seem to have fairly senior connections in the industry?","I'm sick of ""AI Influencers"" - especially ones that parade around with a bunch of buzzwords they don't understand!",1588916694

Hello, I am a junior BI Engineer with 1 year of experience. I have been trying to switch career data analytics, but most jobs require 3-5 years of experience... and it's not like CS jobs where I can make a great project to impress the recruiters. I have been studying Tableau and got certified, working on a significant case study, and learning JavaScript for basic web development. I also have several AWS certifications.

Honestly, I am not sure if there is anything I can do this time. I am not expecting the economy will recover until the summer of 2021, and the job market in Canada is way worse compared to US/UK. Luckily my parents can still support me, but I want to make the best out of it and come out strong.

Doing more projects won't help sadly, since most data science jobs require MS. To be competitive for data analytics, I even thought about passing CFA level 1 because I have seen quite a few risk data analyst jobs that use a lot of Python, SQL, Tableau, R. But it is a huge commitment and costly.

I understand the graph itself was done in R with ggplot2. The highlighted color areas must've been done in something else after like Photoshop or Illustrator.

My question is similar to one asked here 5 years ago where one of the programmers from the chart mentioned something called ChartBuilder.

If anyone has any thoughts about how this graph was created, I'd be very appreciative. Thanks!
