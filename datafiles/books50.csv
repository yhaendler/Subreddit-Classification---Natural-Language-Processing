books,"I was reading *Finnegans Wake*, and then I came across this line on page 77. It reads:

&gt;the beauchamp, byward, bull and lion, the white, the wardrobe

At first, there seems to be a reference to the novel *The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe* by C.S. Lewis, which is just one out of thousands of allusions to other literature. Obviously, the phrase ""lion, the white, the wardrobe"" uses the word ""white"" to indicate the white witch, Jadis.

However, there is a strange aspect to this quote. The C.S. Lewis novel was first written in 1949 and published in 1950, whereas James Joyce, the author of *Finnegans Wake*, died in 1941.

books,"Reading this book was a new experience for me. I usually read science fiction and non fiction history books. ""Coffee and Condolences"" is a story about conquering grief and finding love during a time where one might find it possible. This book puts you in the mind of Miles Alexander after a tragic loss in his life. He suffers from anxiety and that's where this book shines. His mind is scattered and he overthinks every situation he finds himself in. I really enjoyed the characters as well. The story revolves around Miles reconnecting with his step sister and their relationship felt real. I will admit that the plot is nothing you haven't read or seen in a movie before but it really doesn't matter because the characterizations are done so well.

books,"So. I just finished reading Lolita, as the title would imply. I’ve known about it for ages, heard more about it recently, and now I’ve read it.

I don’t know if I misunderstood the feedback I was hearing or what, however...

I would often hear talk about Humbert Humbert as some relatable, likeable monster. Oh yes, the things he was doing were monstrous, but what made the book so fascinating is that Nabokov wrote such an evil character in such a likeable, perhaps even sympathetic fashion!

I really didn’t see this. I found Humbert to be obnoxious, egotistical and generally unlikeable. That’s not even in regards to his relationship with Dolores.

I don’t think there’s a single character he encountered, besides Dolores, who doesn’t cause his internal monologue to sink into some pompous identification and judgement of their character flaws. 

The man’s internal monologue, and thus the narrative of the book, seems to alternate between swooning over Dolores, plotting violence or manipulation against those he thinks are going to take her from him (Or her, as she gets older and he fears she is planning to run away, all while he plans to flee the country with her, have children, and thus ‘replacement nymphettes’ as she grows too old. That was probably the most disturbing moment in his internal monologue. His dream of having daughters and granddaughters who would act as his stream of renewable victims as they became too old for his tastes.) and long-winded diatribes about all the reasons he despises these various yokels, idiots, and generally boorish people he meets.

What do people find so compelling or interesting or sympathetic about him? That the narrative has become one of this wonderfully charming, likeable man narrating all these awful things he is doing?

I did not find Humbert likeable in the slightest. I found him to be an incredibly unlikeable, smug egotist. Independent of his taste in women.",I just finished Lolita. I don’t honestly understand the talk of Humbert as some sympathetic monster.,1599258485

books,"I finally read this book after having it in the back of my mind as one of the books that was assigned to other kids and not me in Elementary School. After that, I never heard anyone talk about it. 

I’ve been reading a lot lately, and buying big stacks from Thrift Stores. Thought I’d give it a shot because it was short, probably light, and something that has always felt “unread” to me. Beckoning to me. 

I was floored. This book is incredible. One-sitting, a couple hours, and I looked up and was not the same as I was when I first looked down. I was expecting something very childish, but this is a real dystopian story that follows a boy I’d describe as a hero. It is a more accessible, less “fantastical” version of the Neverending Story in its theme, it’s got a dash of Fahrenheit 451 which has always been a favorite, and I’m seriously peeved I didn’t read it as a kid but extremely glad I finally made the decision as an adult. 

If you haven’t read it, read it. Beautiful, beautiful story, deserving of all its acclaim. If I was an English teacher I’d be psyched, knowing this book existed. It teaches every literary device. Need to show someone Imagery? The whole book is about appreciating real imagery, and the words you use to describe it. Need characterization, static vs dynamic, need symbolism, need foreshadowing? It’s all there and some of it even defines itself. 

Dark, too. Surprising, poetic delivery of some very disturbing scenes. I almost can’t appreciate a book unless there’s an element of darkness and this satisfied.

books,"I'd never even heard of this book, it's so overshadowed by some of Dumas's other works. But I had to read it as soon as I learned about it- an imprisoned man on a mad quest to grow the world's first fully black tulip, his only aide the daughter of the jailor who keeps him captive. I found a copy on Kobo for only 89 cents so I jumped right in. And let me tell you, I loved it.

The book is so much better than even the description leads you to think. First of all, it's hilarious. The tone of The Black Tulip reminds my of a Wes Anderson or Yorgos Lathimos film. The dramatic irony, the offhand comments, the meaningful names (this tulip-fancier is helped by characters named Rosa and Orange). I love how many times Rosa brought up, very matter of fact and casually, how she was not able to read, until she had to outright tell the main character to teach her how. The book maintains a tone of light, not quite dry comedy that's very effective. It's just delightful. Secondly, the book pulled me in with some surprisingly tense scenes at the beginning. There are prison escapes, beatings, flight from angry mobs, executions, people being torn apart by other people, political intrigue, a scheming prince. There is so much danger and uncertainty, and a lot of it stems purely from the obsessions of tulip growers. And like many classics written so long ago, the format of the book doesn't follow ones we're familiar with today, so it was pretty hard to tell what was going to happen next in the story. Lots of little surprises.

books,"So there is a certain niche for dystopian stories in almost every kind of medium that exists. It is a perfect way to build up the story however the author sees fit which can make almost any dystopian garbage seem possible or real, and it can be added an extra meta story to reflect a certain issue or unforeseen problem.

Many dystopian stories are built on the idea where some kind of authority takes control and everyone else somehow seems to never object against it (or perhaps the control is done in a very clever way) - Fahrenheit 451, 1984, Brave New World.

These are novels that are built upon the idea of a sort of warning if authority figures take their control too far. 

But in other scenarios, dystopian stories are done in what seems to be an epic and gripping story but somehow feels to make itself seem real or authentic - the Hunger Games sometimes fails at this, the Maze Runner, Divergent and so on. 

Interestingly enough, the titles that I just mentioned are mostly young adult novels and apparently, dystopian stories are common in YA books. 

I really like dystopian stories. They are good oppurtunity for world-building, creative liberties and adding morals in creative ways.

Charlie Kaufman's direction really brought this film to life by using the source  material well and creating a piece of art out of it. Do yourself a favor and watch it. Its on netflix now. 

I went on a bit tangent but I'm here to discuss the book. When i started reading the book last year, I expected it to just be a horror novel. But it is so much more than that. It is a psychological/philosophical horror/thriller and I'm sure it can be categorised into more subgenres. It was an unsettling experience reading it to say the least. The long monologues representing important themes such as loneliness and existentialism were enlightening and captivating. The subtle horror and mystique magnified the suspense and kept me at the edge of my seat. And the reveal at the end...initially made me perplexed but after doing research on what it meant and read the book a second time, it really left me in awe of what it all meant.

One reason I think Don DeLillo is so great is because he’s so crystal clear in his prose. Without sacrificing complexity, ambiguity and his top-notch diction, DeLillo writes in a way that engages the reader rather than trying to surprise or confuse him without any kind of over-the-top flourish. I even recall someone say that he attempts to delight the reader, and I believe it. He does it in a way that people like Pynchon just does not do for me in The Crying of Lot 49. (I bring up Pynchon as DeLillo is so often compared with him.) Nonetheless, DeLillo’s work is so thematically complex, I almost always hit JSTOR to read some lit journals to help me get a more theoretical understanding of what I’ve just read.

While it might not have been as ambitious as, say, Libra or Underworld, it was still an impressively grand novel for the small space and time that it took up and the quick read that it was.

But King’s writing style either grips me and I can’t wait to read what’s next.. Or I dread a every second of the slower paced interactions between characters I have no feeling for. 

With that said I’ve been “window shopping” for a new series or book to take the dive into reading again. A few that have caught my interest are Dune, LOTR, Brave New World, A Clockwork Orange.

Any suggestions? Also apologies if breaking any subreddit rules, new here.","Looking for some recommendations in fantasy, sci-fi, anything that can keep my somewhat short attention span",1599232158

books,"The last chapter of the book is a pretty dividing one for many readers, as it changes the meaning of the book completely in a way. Kubrick famously left it out of his adaptation and I feel as though it’s more potent without the last chapter, and shows a hard truth about human nature. While the last chapter gives it a different meaning and gives you a totally different portrayal of human nature and sends a far more “wholesome” message. That is just my opinion, what’s yours?",What does everyone here think about the last chapter of A Clockwork Orange?,1599227794

She’ll only be 12 months old but I want them to be the same books every year, so the books target age range can vary. We are Christians so we’re open to faith centered books but I want a variety of themes (the joy of giving, caring for others, celebrating other holiday traditions)! id love some that feature people people of different races and abilities in a positive way.

Now the bits between chapters the two unnamed people discussing the death, at the end they say read it backwards which I understand is for the reader to re-read the book but backwards.

This is pretty dumb but does that mean to read Chapter 13 first, then 12, 11, 10 etc? and not literally read it backwards.",Question regarding the book I'm Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reid[MAJOR SPOILERS],1599225035

books,"I'm obviously not alone in rereading plenty of books, but am I alone in finding it really strange growing older when the characters stay the same? 

Rereading at 33 something I first read at 12 and suddenly I'm the same age as the parents in that book instead of the kids. How did *that* happen? They seemed monstrously old back then. I reread *The Stand* a few months back and was shocked the find a main character who I still think of as much older than me is actually younger. 

The one I keep coming back to is *David Copperfield*, one of the greatest books ever written about growing up. I first read that at 17 and felt so close to the main character when he's that age. I read it now and it's the oddest sense of nostalgia reacting to that same character as a 33 year old. Makes me wonder how I'll react in another 15 years or so. 

Anyone else find this? I'm guessing the classic example would be Holden Caulfield from *The Catcher in the Rye.*",The Strange Sensation of Outgrowing Book Characters,1599222548

books,"This year marks 100 years since the publication of Edith Wharton's classic novel, **The Age of Innocence**. If you have never read her work before, this is not only a great excuse to dip your toe in the water, but is also a perfect book with which to start. Exploring the tight, rigid social codes amongst the New York super rich-in the early 20th century, **The Age of Innocence** follows the story of Newland Archer, his fiancé May Welland, and what happens when May's cousin, Countess Olenska, scandalously returns to Manhattan after leaving her violent husband. Wharton's writing is beautiful and often fun and bitchy. This is a remarkably repressed society, similar to that in the world Jane Austen depicted many years earlier, in which so much is felt but so little can be publicly expressed. As Wharton herself puts it: 

""The persons of their world lived in an atmosphere of faint implications and pale delicacies.""

If you enjoy reading social comedy, and enjoy writers like Jane Austen, Oscar Wilde or early Henry James, you are guaranteed to enjoy this book. Other novels by Wharton well worth reading include **The House of Mirth** and **The Custom of the Country**.",The centenary of Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence,1599218764

Recently got back into reading! In particular fantasy and sci-fi. 

I have been reading paperbacks mostly but the added art you find in hardbacks really appeals to me! 

I wondered if there were always additional art in hardback editions? I also where the hell I can find what editions of books have been published? For example: 

Brandon Sanderson - the way of kings: 
Original hardback published xx/xx/xxxx
Paper back published xx/xx/xxxx
Mass market paper back published xx/xx/xxxx
