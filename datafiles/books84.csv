books,"I finished this book last week, and I’ve been obsessively pondering the themes and hidden motivations of the characters since.

I’m curious what others think about what Uncle Julian knows to be true. I believe he has always known the murderer is Merricat, and like Constance, feels compelled to either hide or repress that knowledge, although perhaps for different reasons. I often see cited the line where he claims that his niece Merricat “died in an orphanage of neglect”, and the fact that he never directly addresses her, as evidence that he pretends or believes that she is dead. 
I am thinking also of repeated lines where Uncle Julian  mentions his papers and says of Merricat, “But she is of very little importance here.” And also of the line early in the book where Julian expresses to Constance, that if he doesn’t live to publish his own book, he hopes that his notes “are entrusted to some worthy cynic who won’t be too concerned with the truth.”

I think Uncle Julian knows and has always known that Merricat is the murderer, and in his notes he is obfuscating that fact either to protect Merricat or himself. Maybe this is why Merricat feels passively antagonistic toward him, but also unthreatened by him.",We Have Always Lived in the Castle- what Uncle Julian knows ?,1614461630

books,"OK, I think Jane Eyre resonated with people partially because it was a Cinderella story (she was a poor orphan who was abused by her family and later gained wealth and romantic love) but also because this was possibly the 19th century's first exposure to the rom-com story structure.

Jane is the underdog who is pitted against Blanche, who is hotter/more popular than her and who will probably wed the man she is in love with. This is the equivalent of the main character's love interest being unavailable because he's still with his hot/evil girlfriend/fiance who antagonizes the main character. Then he miraculously chooses the protagonist because of true love. Unfortunately, all rom-coms must have some contrived reason to break apart the leads when they get together. In Jane Eyre's case, instead of some overblown misunderstanding, (ie a girl throws herself at the male lead and the female protagonist walks in at the wrong moment) Edward Rochester has been holding his wife captive in his attic and she's insane and trying to murder everyone. Sure. 

Anyway, then the situation gets resolved, the protagonist maybe also rejects someone else because it's not True Love (St. John), and they get back together. Fin.",Jane Eyre has the format of a modern day rom-com,1614453143

books,"....and it's not even (strictly) a book! 

I don't remember where I first heard of it, but I've had Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke on my 'to read' list in my Notes app for months now, and finally took the plunge and bought the book a few days ago. I did this despite not being the least bit familiar with Rilke's works - something about the entire concept of the book just spoke to me, and I bought it without doing much research.

It was a *joy* to read. Two pages in, and I had to stop to go and get my highlighter because I sensed that Rilke would be imparting words and thoughts and sentiments that I'd find profound. It's a small book - I finished reading all ten letters in a single sitting, within an hour, but I just know that it's a book I'll read over and over again in the coming years. Rilke's letters just hold so much depth in them, and each sentence seems so carefully crafted, each word so specifically placed, that I find myself having to pause to absorb the page properly often. I feel like this book couldn't have come to me at a better time, because I can place myself in the young poet's shoes, I can understand the feelings and doubts he's felt, and Rilke's gentle advice seems to be speaking directly to me, *for* me.

Something from the book that I see quoted on the Internet often is: ""What matters is to live everything. *Live* the questions for now. Perhaps then you will gradually, without noticing it, live your way into the answer, one distant day in the future."" 

But my favourite lines would have to be the few sentences right before it: ""You are so young, all still lies ahead of you, and I should like to ask you, as best I can, dear Sir, to be patient towards all that is unresolved in your heart and to try to love *the questions themselves* like locked rooms, like books written in a foreign tongue. Do not now strive to uncover answers: they cannot be given you because you have not been able to live them.""

I think what I took away from the book is that things take time, and life may not necessarily pan out the way you expect it to, but just do you and trust in the process. It's something I know in my heart very well, but I still appreciate coming across reminders in my daily life - that's the same reason why I love Billy Joel's Vienna. 

Life lessons aside, I definitely recommend checking out this book if you haven't yet. If nothing else, give it a read just to appreciate Rilke's talent for writing letters.",Letters to a Young Poet just became my book of the year,1614439803
