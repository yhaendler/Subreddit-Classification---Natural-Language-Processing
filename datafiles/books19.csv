books,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is without doubt the most important book I’ve ever read. The act of reading this novel has unquestionably changed who I am.

To understand what I mean, I need to take you back many years to 1997. In June, Bloomsbury publish Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. In September, I start Secondary School. There’s a huge buzz around the book but it feels too young for me and I never get round to reading it. At this point I’d read most of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter seemed like a backwards step.

Fast forward to 2001, Daniel Radcliffe stars in the film adaptation. I’m now 15, dark-haired, wear glasses, keep quiet and am often the smartest or best performer in class. I’m not a nerd or an outcast, I play rugby for the school and have plenty of friends.

At some point, I don’t remember who or when, someone connects the three of us (Harry, Daniel and me). For the most part it’s Harry that I’m compared to, as far as I remember for the resemblance.

I’d been bullied before, would be bullied again and would bully people. For some reason, the only thing that I have never been able to shake is the feeling of persecution and worthlessness when I’m called Harry. It was by no means a new nickname for me, those who called me by it were usually older and would soon move on. Yet, it stuck with me long after it was said. The more I reacted, the more people would drop it in.

I wondered for a while if the people calling me Harry were intimidated by me. By our nature, we bully those who are smarter or more successful than us, trying to make them seem more human than the idealised version we have in our minds.

I’d like to say I never bullied again after this started, but who would believe that. As we get trodden on by bigger people, so we step on those smaller than us.

This went on throughout school, with no-one knowing I was so cut up about it. I learned to laugh it off and try to own in. This led to the worst event, where I was invited to a party of a boy in the year above me on the condition that I turned up as Harry Potter. All my friends were going, so I pretended I thought it was funny too and turned up in full fancy dress with broomstick and all. To this day, that is the least dignified I have felt. I traded my soul for a party.

After school, the names changed as Radcliffe become more popular in his own right. I’d even get some appreciation from girls who fancied him. Yet, even at university the occasionally “You’re a wizard Harry” would drift in from someone walking past me and I’d crumble inside.

It took 15 years before I was comfortable enough with myself to sit down and enjoy reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. A decade and a half of ignoring books and films that many around me love, because it still reminded me of the feelings I used to get in the depths of my stomach. I’ve done much braver things in that time, dealt with bigger problems, but never cracked it until now.

I don’t know if it’s because I’m a father of two, happy in my career or just finally old enough to let go, but picking up the paperback felt important. As I read, I enjoyed myself and felt ridiculous for avoiding a harmless book for so long.

The first Harry Potter novel is one of those special books that young and adult readers can both understand and enjoy in their own ways. Superficially, there’s a coming-of-age, magical adventure story with a clear structure, villain and battle. Look deeper, and it deals with class, racism, bullying, coming to terms with ourselves and realising we each have strengths. There’s no age at which those lessons can’t help a reader. Perhaps the only real flaw is the oddly quick way in which the conclusion unfolds, which feels anticlimactic and unnecessarily forced.

It’s been a long journey, but I finally understand what Harry Potter means to me. Being told you’re a wizard is one thing, but embracing it is something much more important.",Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone by JK Rowling,1585606413

books,"Hello all. I don’t know about you guys, but although I do find some nice quotes while reading, there are only a few quotes that really stick with me. I’d like to know what your favorite quote from a book is and why it resonates with you. I’d like this to be a discussion of quotes and not just short answers. 

My favorite quote is from “Call Me By Your Name” by André Aciman. (For context, the passage is about the main character playing a piano piece)

“I knew exactly what phrase in the piece must have stirred him the first time, and each time I played it, I was sending it to him as a little gift, because it was really dedicated to him, as a token of something very beautiful in me that would take no genius to figure out and that urged me to throw in an extended cadenza. Just for him.”

I found Call Me By Your Name really poetic, and there were a lot quotes and passages I loved, but this quote above resonated with me on a level I have a hard time explaining. It’s not that I recognize myself in the passage or that it reminds me of a loved one. I’m not sure what it is, really, but it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve read and every time I read it a sort of calm feeling and hope breeze through my body. I’ve never felt like this before with anything I’ve read, but it’s almost like I’m in love with the passage itself, which sounds really weird, I know, but I can’t explain it any other way.

One of the main reasons for this is that I'm in denial that I dislike a book until I've finished it and can say for sure.

books,"In his book The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, Mark Manson states that consumer culture and social media breed the idea that happiness comes from more, but argues happiness comes not from giving a fuck about more, but giving a fuck only about what aligns with one's personal values.

&amp;#x200B;

In chapter 1, subsection The Feedback Loop from Hell, page 27, Mark says:

&amp;#x200B;

""Because **when you give too many fucks**—when you give a fuck about everyone and everything—**you will feel that you’re perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way** ***you*** **want it to be**. This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive. You will see every adversity as an injustice, every challenge as a failure, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal. You will be confined to your own petty, skull-sized hell, burning with entitlement and bluster, running circles around your very own personal Feedback Loop from Hell, in constant motion yet arriving nowhere.""

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot follow this reasoning. If something, let's say an awesome car, is important to me because it aligns with my values (i.e. I give a fuck), I am willing to work and suffer to get it. If it does not align, I let it go and don't give a fuck about it. But if I feel entitled, I give a fuck about getting the car but am not willing to suffer for it.

books,"Yes I have a lot of free time now. I devoured this book in about four days. I didn’t expect such a readable and enjoyable novel. Hugo is every bit the story teller of a Dumas but a far better writer (I previously read the Count of Monte Cristo). Even more rare he is a great writer who also has such compassion and soul. There’s great nobility in his writing.

Of critique, there are many portions which you can omit or skim. I’d estimate about 200 pages here and there. You’ll know it when you come upon it. In fact I’d urge you start the novel a chapter before the main character is introduced about 50 pages in. Hugo has other motives then just advancing a story along, some of which may not interest the reader. That’s ok of course.

I’d also say that Les Miserables goes one leg too long. It’s rather sadistic the torment he puts upon Jean Valjean. Too much melodrama seeps in at the end.

Anyone know how Hunchback stacks up against Les Mis? Also does Hugo have other overlooked novels?",Les Miserables,1585586413
books,"Don't get me wrong, I loved ""The Shining"" but my feelings for ""Christine"" are stronger.

It's incredibly creepy at times, which i found surprising, since the idea of a ""haunted car"" might seem a bit corny or stupid.
This story is a curious cross between true nostalgia and horror but also about obsession and possesion.

The book is heavily character driven, I loved all the characters, even with their flaws.

""Christine"" is Stephen King at his best.
I hope we will see a sequel or a prequel some day.","[Stephen King] If i admitted that i enjoyed ""Christine"" more than ""The Shining"", would that amount to sacrilege ?",1585586277

books,"One of my favorite books in my early teens was The Giver by Lois Lowry. I even found a signed copy at a recycled book store for $2.50 and it has held a place of honor on my bookshelf. 

I recently re-read it for the first time since I was a teenager, and I cant help but feel a little uncomfortable. It is far more disturbing than I remember. Looking back, I am pretty sure what I loved about it when I was younger was the idea of being singled out in your community to receive all the knowledge of society. The passing along of memories and wisdom. But that isn't really what the book is about. Its about being the only person in your society that is awake to the choices you are being denied. Its about population control, thought control, behavior control. 

I have never been a fan of post apocalyptic stories. I much prefer the optimism of bringing humanity back from the brink, or defending goodness in the face of evil. So the fact that nothing in the community can change, and Jonas' only option is to run away and save himself leaves me feeling desolate.",The Giver - not what I remember,1585583304

books,"Theres much that could be said about this book. 

One of my favorite things about what I consider Golden Era sci-fi writers is their ability to craft a specific language or set of slang to which fits the universe they create, such as Robert Heinlein's ""Grok"" from Stranger in a Strange Land, or in the case of Huxley: Pneumatic.

The use of Pneumatic in Brave New World is liken to ""Thicc"" in our current vernacular. I think that Pneumatic is a far better word.

It's more descriptive and when I visualize the word, provides a much better imagery than Thicc ever has.

I propose that we adopt this word as the new standard, since we're basically living in a Sci-Fi dystopia anyway and may as well get ahead of the curve.","Started reading Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, again during the lockdown.
