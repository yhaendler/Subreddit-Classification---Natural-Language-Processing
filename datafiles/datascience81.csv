Just to preface, I have 3 years experience as a Data Scientist in a large multinational organization, doing mostly delivery work. They are shutting down our department so I'm actively looking for positions. I've already done a few good interviews and have many lined up.

I was interviewing for a startup (in the Middle East) and got to the technical interview. Started off with me introducing myself and my background, we then went off do do a 30 minutes code review. I was asked a simple question of how to count duplicate characters in a string. I went over my approach and asked if I can use the internet to find the exact code to do that (as you know no one actually memorizes code). The interviewer hesitated but then agreed. So I typed the code and the executed it to debug and make sure it works. The interviewer then interjected saying i shouldn't be running the code. (First red flag?)

After a few back and forth, we skipped over to the theory, and i prefaced by saying I don't have a maths background (I did engineering), the interviewer interjected again saying that a data scientist needs a math background (second red flag?). That was it for me. I ended the interview and said that we won't be a good fit.

Maybe the startup didn't know what they were doing, or the interviewer was new, or maybe they had a generic job description, I'm not mad at them or anything. I just saw that they are not suitable for me so I moved on. 

In this industry, many people think that getting a job is the number one priority, but it's not, your own mental well being and how happy you are are as important as having a job, you don't want to end up working with a company that aligns with your way of work and your work ethics.

So, I accepted cause, I really can't believe i'm having an interview, and because I was curious about the job.

Everything went well, they did a test on me, piece of cake, but i'm having second thoughts now


Will this be useful in my path of becoming a data scientist? Is any experience good for recruiters? Should I just use My time instead to learn new tools?

Professionally, I worked at three large financial institutions over my career. At my first job, I worked for 4 years in a back-office environment for a mutual fund department. I transitioned to another institution for 6 years working in wealth management alongside Financial Advisors. I took a sabbatical and taught in Asia at a University for a year.

In a perfect world, I'd become a data analyst/scientist, but I am not sure my credentials line up as these job postings typically want degrees in CS/Physics/Mathematics. I haven't had an analyst type position previously to supplement.

Are hybrid roles, like businesses analyst or project manager, available with my background and lite back-end skills? I would like working as a back-end programmer for a few years to really develop some skills, but I am unsure about realistically finding this type of role with my background.

Lastly, the front-end seems to make the most sense for me in terms of my career's story. But I don't want to make front end web pages.

The logs are stored into a Elasticsearch DB in order to make the analysis ill have to query or use some other tool like Kibana or Python.

At the moment I'm trying to decide what project methodology I'm going to use. For software development I know Agile like methodology. But I also read that for Datascience there are methodologies like Crisp-DM or ""Team Data Science Process"" from Microsoft and also combination from CRISP &amp; SCRUM. And a lot more. 

My question how do I decide if the scope of the project is Datascience and not just Software Development? Or maybe it can be little bit of both? Wondering what you guys think.",Determine if project is Datascience or just Software Development?,1612823547

datascience,"I've been going through a round of hiring recently, and some of the things I'm seeing combined with the usual ""which MS program should I choose?"" posts made me realize that other than broad generalizations (e.g., ""don't do an MS in DS""), no one has ever covered the why and how you should evaluate potential programs.

This is by no means meant to be a ""this is how everyone thinks about this stuff"" kinda post, but rather how I specifically think of these programs both as a hiring manager and when giving people advice as to what programs to pursue.

First, let's start with what are the main elements that (most) hiring managers are looking for when evaluating a resume:

**Is this person smart enough?** Pretty straight forward. You want to hire smart people that are going to push everyone in the team to be better.

**Is this person productive?** You don't want smart people that never get anything done. You want smart people who deliver.

**Will this person be able to learn the things about my company/industry that are necessary for the role?** Most of the time, this means ""will they be willing to learn"", as most domains are not rocket science and just require some dedication to learning the ropes.

**Do they meet enough of the foundational technical skills required to do the job to where I think they can acquire the rest?** If you're hiring for an entry level role where someone will be using Python, R, SQL and Tableau, maybe you don't care that much if they've never used Tableau - it's easy to learn. And maybe you don't care if they know R - because if they know Python, it shouldn't be hard to pick up. But you need them to know at least *some* of this stuff - mostly so you have some reason to believe they can learn the rest.

**Do they have an area in which they have demonstrated deep expertise?** It's fine to hire someone that is jack of all trades for some roles, but generally speaking something you like to see on a resume is that someone has been able to take an area of focus and become very proficient in it. You recognize that every data scientist can't be great at everything, but you ideally want them to be great at *something*.

Ok, great - now how does this help us evaluate MS programs?

**Is this person smart enough = What is the university + prorgram's brand?**

While an interview process can certainly help you further refine your estimate as to how smart someone is, most hiring managers will (consciously or subconsciously) look for ways to estimate this faster while sifting through resumes. And academic achievement often becomes one of the places we look at first. 

Question to ask:

* How easy is it to get into this program? GRE scores, GPAs, what does the average person entering the program look like? Is it mostly kids with excellent grades from excellent undergrad programs in fields closely related to DS? Or is it basically ""anyone willing to pay for it""? Or somewhere in between?
* How easy is it to graduate from this program? Is it like an MBA where everyone graduates? Or is it like a traditional MS degree where the first semester often comes with some grade casualties?
* How is the university (and more specifically the STEM fields within the university) perceived by the people in the field? And is this program taught by the same faculty that have earned that reputation? The red flag here are programs that bring in lecturers just to teach the classes in this program.
* How new is the program? A newer program has a smaller sample size to evaluate its grads, therefore its brand will never be as strong as that of more established programs.

Now, let me be very clear here: just because someone graduated from Stanford, MIT, etc., it does not automatically make them smart. And just because someone graduated from a less reputable school, it does not mean they are not smart. However, hiring managers are human, and at the end of the day, if they see that a kid graduated with a MS in CS from Stanford vs. another kid who graduated with a MS in CS from the University of Alaska at Walrusville... your biases are going to start showing even if you are aware of the fact that this bias could be wrong. What's worse - some hiring managers will not even look at resumes that aren't from top, top schools (a horrible hiring practice).

So if you, as an individual, need to choose between two programs, at least one factor should be ""how smart will people think I am if I graduate with this degree from this school?"".

**Is this person productive? = How much work will you need to produce to graduate + how much work will you be enabled to do?**

Some programs require a capstone project. Some require a MS thesis. Some require at least one publication (which then doubles as your thesis). Some require internships on top of that. The higher the graduation requirements, the more likely it is that when you graduate, your resume will have more entries that show a hiring manager that you can do stuff (beyond going to class).

In addition to that, programs that encourage or facilitate grads to work in multidisciplinary projects, or personal projects, etc., will also helps grads in terms of filling out a resume.

**Will this person be able to learn the things about my company/industry that are necessary for the role? = Has this person shown the ability to learn about a specific domain already?**

Some programs are very theoretical - so much so that someone may graduate without every applying their work to an actual, specific industry application. I've seen this a LOT with people working in statistics and OR - where research will focus so much on methodology that the ""applications"" end up being horribly simplified, toy model-like constructs.

**Do they meet enough of the foundational technical skills required to do the job to where I think they can acquire the rest? = Do they at the very least know R or Python** ***really*** **well**

I could go on for hours here, but at the end of the day someone who is really strong in R or Python should be fine. SQL, Tableau, cloud stuff, git, etc, is all easy stuff to learn by comparison. But the more work you can show where you've used these, the better.

**Do they have an area in which they have demonstrated deep expertise? = Have they been recognized for their work in any given area (e.g., like through a publication)?**

This is the one area where programs that are MBA-like in nature really struggle, i.e., where the graduation requirement is a capstone project. Why? Because a capstone project is normally an exercise in execution, not depth. The goal of a capstone project is to arrive at a solution in a fixed amount of time. It is not to get a full understanding of the field and then try to make a contribution to the literature - as minute as that contribution may be.

However, it doesn't have to be a journal publication that validates you here - it could also be in the form of their work actually getting implemented by a company. Or receiving an award for the quality of their capstone project. But it needs to be something that says that other people - outside of your professors - thought this contribution was meaningful.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

With all of that listed, where do different programs fall? It's not always easy to say, but let's pick some examples and work through them:

**Masters degree in Computer Science from a top 10-20 program in the country  (e.g., UT Austin, Michigan, UCLA, Penn, Purdue):**

Smart? Probably - the admission requirements are pretty high for these schools/programs. Plus, these schools are normally well-regarded in STEM in general. I would assume that someone who met the criteria to be accepted is probably fairly smart. Also, these are programs that are hard to graduate from.

Productive? Maybe - you will need at least a thesis to graduate, but how much more than that you do is going to be very person dependent.

Domain knowledge? Probably low - these are programs that are going to focus much more on methodology and SWE skills than they are on any one individual industry.

Technical reqs? Pretty strong - you're not going to graduate (or maybe even get admitted) without knowing a good chunk of Python, SQL, coding practices, etc.

Deep expertise? Probably - graduation requires a thesis, so it's likely that someone with a MS in CS will have made a pretty deep dive into a given topic.

**MS in Business Analytics from a top 10-20 program in the country (same list of suspects):**

Smart? Maybe - the admission requirements are certainly not that stringent, and given that they follow an MBA model, in my experience they are not hard to graduate from. So I wouldn't just assume that someone who graduated from such a program to be automatically smart (although it certainly doesn't mean they are not smart - plenty of really smart people enroll in these programs).

Productive? Likely yes - there will be a lot of classroom projects, a capstone projects, and likely an internship (which most traditional programs don't do).

Domain knowledge? As strong as it can get in a classroom setting - you are much more likely to spend time talking about specific applications to specific problem statements in the real world.

Technical reqs? Questionable. It's likely that you will graduate knowing how to write Python code, but not to the level of someone with legit swe skills.

Deep expertise? Probably not. MS in BA programs tend to focus on breadth over depth, so it's unlikely that you will have spent a ton of time on any one area of data science - certainly not enough for you to become an expert. In my experience as a hiring manager, this is the spot that candidates from this background struggle with the most.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So, does that mean that no one should ever enroll in a MS in DS program?

Not at all. It just means two things:

1. You should expect to compete for a different type of job. That is, it's highly unlikely that a hiring manager looking for someone with either a) deep expertise on any sub-area of DS or b) the ability to write production-quality code is going to look to someone with a MS in DS as their prime pipeline for candidates. However, someone looking for DS generalists and/or people who want to be much more business embedded/facing may very well find better fitting candidates in DS programs.
2. Going into it, you should know what areas you may need to further develop on your own. And this goes for both camps. 

* If you're studying CS, something you may want to do is develop your own personal portfolio of more applied projects where you can showcase your real-world problem-solving skills. 
* If you're in a MS in DS program, something you may want to do is spend more time outisde of class working on your programming chops.",How to evaluate graduate programs for a DS career,1612821360

In short, it's a freaking mess out there and I pity any unfortunate soul that, like me, just wants to mold raw data into beautiful insights and benefit everyone around them if they're given the chance. So, I decided to write a **real cover letter** that I would love to send to employers and one that if I got at any of my previous employments, I would immediately put on top of the stack. But let me know. What do you think would happen if I sent this? Are you concerned about any points I raised or want to give me some advice? I welcome any feedback as I'm just trying to stay sane in this climate:

&amp;#x200B;

COVER LETTER:

Dear Hiring Manager,

I was one of those kids that genuinely got excited by solving puzzles. Jigsaws, crosswords, metal and plastic model building, mathematical and verbal brain teasers, I consumed it all. And I kept that excitement that now shows up in my work with data. Each new project presents a whole host of puzzles to solve, from defining business questions correctly, to obtaining and preparing data appropriate to the task, to presenting insights to guide discussions and decision making.

So, what does this mean for your organization? 

1) It means you are getting someone who’s interested in learning and improving. Not only personally, but also automating processes surrounding work, especially the mundane tasks that distract from the real challenges, ensuring that every project is not just benefiting the client but also improves the overall efficiency and workflow of your team. 

2) It means you are getting a true nerd. Not a memorization or reading guru that prepared well for the interview to get a well-paid job, but someone who will take their time to get accuracy and science aspects of the project on the right track, identify what needs to be learned, and then actually learn it, and not for raises or praises, but because he actually enjoys doing it.

3) It means you are getting a doer and a thinker, and only sometimes a talker. Look, we all know extroversion is highly correlated with professional success. I did a recent project showing that nearly all types of extroverts receive much higher salaries than nearly all types of introverts. And it is understandable that management is over-represented with extroverted personalities. But data science is a highly hands-on profession. And at the end of the day, do you want someone in this position who has not done validation and argued their way out of it during team meeting? Or do you want someone who has skipped the team meeting to get it done? Time is limited, so someone talking is, by definition, not doing. In the short-term, it might seem like you are increasing your productivity through making decisions in team meetings and hiring highly social individuals, but if one of your models fails due to a lack of time spent on actually working on it, you are exposing yourself to great risk for company reputation. To be truly productive, the team needs to be well-balanced, and as a self-proclaimed “mildly extroverted introvert,” I sit at that middle ground between getting it done and letting people know what’s been done, and can act at the same time as the doer of work and an arbiter of team cohesion and efficient project management.

When it comes to my past proven contributions, I could talk about my numerous successful projects and impressive KPI increases, but they are mostly listed in my resume and you can see them. So, I would say curiosity and common sense are my biggest contributions. Anyone with decent training can fit a model and get some results, the problem occurs when you have someone like a software engineer with no statistical training build quick models without a feel for what kind of data will output valid results, or a data analyst not bothering to check for cause and effect relationship in the model by experimenting and training the model on highly irregular data (think if you trained sales data during Black Friday and assumed it will remain the same for the following year), or a statistician spending six months to check every nook and cranny and make sure the model is airtight to the point that the client has already completely changed their priorities and the entire project is useless. Things like that are a huge risk for companies and are extremely easy to overlook by people that are not curious about the data science process and not interested in innovating and optimizing their workflows. And it is exactly the area in which I excel.

If you like this cover letter and we proceed to the interview process, I must warn you not to be surprised. In client presentations, I am very tactful and knowledgeable about the subject matter. In job interviews, however, I am going in blind to obtain a good mutual match between my own needs and that of your organization and I see no point in being dishonest or subservient. It is similar to dating, in a way, but we only have limited time, so I cannot “take it slow.” I will ask questions that might be uncomfortable, and I will not have all the answers to your questions, even if you think they are basic. But please keep in mind, that again same as dating, I am trying to be genuine and there are no perfect matches. I want all my concerns out there quickly and I want to know yours as well, so we can ensure the fit is right for everyone. Perhaps your phrased your question in a way that I do not understand, perhaps what you are asking from me does not correlate with what I believe about the position and I need more information. I want to be as frank as possible to minimize any miscommunication.

I understand that many people stay extremely formal and stick to small talk during interviews, trying hard to attract the employer to their candidacy. I do not like to play these games, I will not exaggerate my knowledge and skills, and I will tell you honestly if I see any problems with the process or the working environment. I believe a growth mindset company will see the value in such honest and straightforward approach to work and will want workers who are at the office because they want to be there and speak up to improve efficiency. I believe the company that accepts and champions the ideals of science will want an open communicative environment in which I will surely fit in.",The cover letter I actually want to send to employers,1612803316

I'm a psychology student with a long passion for statistics that grew into a love for Data Science for about 2-3 years by now.

I was wondering if you could give me some tips on what should I learn to be a more well-rounded data scientist.

We basically do statistics about cities plus some other consultancy stuff and some of us are trying to raise the bar using DS methods to get better results rather than just hoping the national statistics office will have relevant data.

So I need to get the total area of urban parks in every municipality of my country, using Open Street Map data (There are a few official land cover tools but their quality is pretty dismal). I do most of my analysis in Python so there I go: import geopandas, import pandas... now, how does one download data from OSM in Python? I've done that using OSMNx (a brilliant library to perform all sorts of network analysis on city street networks using OSM data), besides using JOSM or the QGIS plug-in. So there I write a function to download the data I need for every polygon in a shapefile (Did I mention there's almost 9000 municipalities in my country? Now you know) and set it running. My PC almost grinds to a halt but I manage to still be semi-productive reviewing some work from my colleagues, documenting some stuff, you get it. After twelve hours, Jupyterlab gives up. Never mind, this must be because there are just too many municipalities and, let's face it, OSMNx is slow. So let's try joining as many polygons as possible and try it again. The computer almost grinds to a halt. My laptop is not particularly bad but definitely not up to the task. Back to the drawing board.

Then I think, I already have all the OSM data for my country, I just need libraries to query it... esy-osmfilter! Nope, it didn't work. Timed out. Pyrosm. Neither. I'm loosing the little sanity I had left. Should I try QGIS? It's crashing if I try, been there done that. Another lost day. Finally, I remembered, of course, that one queries with SQL and that as much as I'm the Python guy at work, I need not use it for everything. Now, my SQL knowledge is rather abyssal but I can survive if it's not too tough. So I googled ""how to open pbf file in postgis"" for two minutes. Took twenty minutes to understand how osm2pgsql works, twenty more minutes to set up the database and fifteen minutes to query it, check it worked and export it to a geopackage to do the analysis tomorrow morning.

datascience,"Hello, I’m a currently a sophomore undergrad majoring in statistics. I’ve only really done “statistical” programming in python and R, mainly done data analysis/cleaning and sklearn/tidymodels model fitting in a notebook or rmarkdown. And some basic dashboarding in streamlit. My plan is to get a MS in applied statistics and then work in Data Science. My major kind of aligns along the classical statistician type of background, which I’m okay with because I wanted a strong math background for a career in DS cause that’s what I THOUGHT was important. But I’ve come to realize that it’s a lot less important than software dev/cs skills. 

, I said to myself that I wasn’t going to complain about this because I thought that I would just try and learn data structures/algs and relevant cs topics to at least have some sort of software skills. But in doing so I’ve realized that I’m going to end up wasting my stats degree and never going to use it in industry.

Everywhere I’ve read about jobs in DS it’s that you need 75% software skills related to productionising and maybe 25% of statistical knowledge. These aren’t hard facts but basically from what I’ve read stats and math knowledge is not as useful as cs/software dev skills.

I’m just worried I’m going to go through all this schooling only to compete with software developers, and then learn all these various software tools only to become a software dev with a rigorous stats background and a “Data scientist” title when I’m not even doing any sort of statistical work, and my stats background will be a waste of money/time.

I want to be close to Machine Learning/statistical learning and building models, but it just seems like these software skills related to data eng/production tools are going to overshadow any statistical knowledge I have gained through my degree, thus making my degree a waste since I will be using maybe 5% of it.

I’m rambling here, but could any data scientists in industry here with an applied stats/stats background shed light on if their degree is really used in data science industry. And really how much statistical knowledge u actually get to apply relative to software dev knowledge? And if u felt like the degree was a waste compared to if you got a CS degree? 

It just seems like industry doesn’t actually care if you have stat/ML knowledge but more so if you can use software skills.",Worried that my degree will be useless,1612460076

datascience,"Hello,

A new project has started at my job that requires me and 2 other data scientist to work together. We are working more in parallel because a lot needs to get done in a short period of time. I want to use this opportunity to make sure we work cohesively for two reasons. One, make sure we deliver the best possible project given the time constraint and Two to get some managing experience. I hope one day to become a technical lead. All this being said what has worked for you guys in the past? Right now I have all the high level steps written down in a Onenote, essentially it can be split in to 3 parts and then substeps in each part. I plan on adding our code there, as I have gotten lost with my own code in the past and not been able to replicate results. Each high level step has a date for accomplishment and an assignee, I'm planning on adding more of my procedure as I go along ( adding substeps) but I'm not sure if my collaborators will want to do that, so I might have to do it for them.  


Thanks in advance for the help",Recommendation for properly documenting collaboration projects,1612450470
datascience,"I keep reading that the lines are blurred with the three roles because each company has differing needs. I'm my company's data scientist/data engineer and head of analytics... and I have a data analyst reporting to me. 

Given that, I do dashboarding, lite machine learning, ELT and database development, etc. Very much a generalist with a focus on analytics and reporting rather than ML.

However, this is probably more the norm, correct? Curious what this sub's experience is in defining their roles/identities.","How many of you are hybrids of data analyst, data scientist, and data engineer?",1612449890
