datascience,"Hi all! Here is a bit of a story, I'm not exactly looking for answers but just people's opinions to help me make my own decision on my path in life.

I just turned 26. Received my bachelor's of engineering in electrical engineering last summer with 2.2 GPA (it was bad). I'm interested in starting a career but I have to be honest with myself and it sucks to say so. That I chose this because my dad didn't want me in computer science. After 7 years of failing and picking myself back up again I finally graduated. However I was so busy just trying to pass I never really thought of what my prospects are. I was always fascinated by software and data. Manipulating it to present results. In some engineering courses we did this and whenever we had a software portion I was the go to guy to do it. Ive recently been talking to some friends who are data scientists and what they do. It's really interesting and I want to do it. I've been presented two options by a couple of friends. 

1) Go back to university for a computer science degree : this one I feel is a bit drastic but tbh for a 26 year old I haven't grown much. I live with my mom still, I barely make above minimum wage working a warehouse job, I just lack a lot of things people my age have. Computer Science is something Ive always wanted to study and now I have realized my health issues (diagnosed with sever sleep apnnea so I'm now using a CPAP machine) it feels like a reset. However the scary part is taking a chance but a part of me feels like it's worth it. Yes the debt is gonna be ridiculous and I accept that.

2) a local community college offers a graduate diploma in Data Analytics. I've recently found this and thought it was interesting. It's a one year program and it fits all the things I need. I'm not sure about since I don't know anyone who's taken it.

3) I've thought about self learning but to be honest without having a bit of a push I know myself enough now to know it doesn't go exactly as planned especially when needing my own time to hype myself up to go through resources and try to understand concepts by myself.

Also for extra information. I live in Ontario Canada which has become a crazy software and data hub. Electrical engineering doesn't have much here especially with low grades.

Also if someone can link me to good resources to just reading about data science or videos I'd very much appreciate it. I can't fully learn from them but maybe it'll help me understand what my passion is more.

I had an unusual situation happen in the past few days, and I'd like some advice.

A staffing agency in the Bay Area offered me the opportunity to interview for a DS role on a FAANG team that would directly impact a product that is popular worldwide (think 100m+ users). I like the role, but am hesitant about it being a contract position, considering I have a full-time job lined up post-MS in the Bay Area that is paying 135k (\~150k if you include benefits, 170k if equity options aren't worth crap) with a team I like, though at a much smaller scale (more relatively unknown) company with far fewer DS to learn from.

The recruiter told me the team wants to bring me in for an additional 7 interviews, testing me on everything (statistics, ML, product sense, python, SQL, behavioral), but that the position would only be paying 120k. I told her it would need to pay at least 180k for me to waste my time preparing and interviewing for the role, considering I have a full-time offer already. I was told today they would match the 180k.

Was I being extremely low-balled initially? The staffing agency is well known, and I've heard decent things about it.

**The interview**

I had three interviews to pass.

* Technical (with one of the nicest recruiters/Data analyst/scientist)
* HR (also a very nice person)
* Manager (very serious guy, he scared the shit out of me, but once I started working with them he was super nice)

***Technical***

1. SQL = What would you write to do x, y, z. (Small question to test if I know how to use SQL or not at all)
2. Business question to test my business acumen
3. Statistics questions regarding outliers and robust preprocessing, median and mean in skewed data

Yes overall, the interview was not that hard, because I am a Civil Engineer + Master of AI. I truly think that having a good educational gives a nice push. The interviewer will think, if he made it that far, he won't be a dumb fuck (unless i cheated all the way). Yes I know, good grades does not mean intelligence. But good grades/good education means hard work and that's what most company want (hard workers) in my opinion.

***HR***

1. Testing my French skills (I am supposed to be bilingual but once you start talking English everyday you start losing the French vocab, ""le science de data"" I said it like 30 times (FFS)) mainly because in Belgium the languages are French, English, Dutch and German.
2. General storytelling, my cv, why i came to europe, why i chose my masters, what i did before coming
3. Motivation: on why I found the position interesting. BTW Deals Analytics is one of the most fun position if you check the YouTube videos.
4. \*\*Me saying some jokes to gain points :p\*\*

**Manager**

1. Same as HR but with a lot more pressure. I got scared to death no joke (I bet many people know what I am talking about)

**First Week as an Intern**

Right away, I had to learn the software they use, which is **Alteryx**. Since I have already done my Pandas and SQL on DataCamp, I did not require lots of time to get used to it. **VERY** fun no code software for data cleaning and prepping.

**First Project** 

I directly started working on an RED financial data. The goal was to create insight from the financial data to direct the next investments in the right path (most lucrative).

**Second Project**

Geospatial analysis. Oh boiii, Oh BOIIIII ! This one was amazing. I had no idea how good is creating a map and understanding the effect of the surroundings on the business. This one was huge! Learned how to webscrape, how to deal with JSONS and much more. 

**Third Project**

Computer Vision project (what the actual fuck? are we still in the same internship?). Haha. Matter of fact, I had learned a course on CV and I was like: ""guys i studied this a few months ago, I can solve it with CV"". Everyone liked it so much (even though i copy pasted the code from my old projects \*\*evil laugh\*\*) 

**Fourth Project**

Geospatial Analysis again. But this was one very tough and stressing. 

**Fifth Project**

At that point I had to work on my thesis because I had an intermediate presentation. However, the project was about traffic analysis (traffic as in cars). A dream coming true because i am a civil engineer specialized in traffic engineering/transportation. We did amazing stuff but they were very limited :(.

**The End**

One thing to add, for however gets an internship at a big4, I hope you get a supervisor similar to the one I had. I loved him. Always supportive and encouraging. He cared about me on the personal level.

My instinct tells me I should just run n-1 evaluations against the control group. If I run a 3-way split test, for example, I should find significance and power twice:

1. Treatment A vs Control
2. Treatment B vs Control

So, in that case, I'm finding out which, if any, treatment performed better than the control (1-way test, alt: treatment - control &gt; 0, the basic marketing hypothesis).

But, it's occurred to me that running a third test contrasting Treatment A with Treatment B could reveal that those two treatments are likely different than one another. And that would lead to a goofy conclusion like this:

1. Treatment A = Control
2. Treatment B &gt; Control
3. Treatment B = Treatment A

If treatments A and B are likely only different due to random chance, how could only one of them outperform the control?

I started my professional journey only a few months back. I was put into the Automation team, which is totally out of my area of expertise as I have had no background in computer engineering. I majored in Economics with a minor in computer science, and have always felt that I would be more suitable for a datascience related role. But being this early in my career, I have heard sayings like ""You shouldn't fixate yourself on one field this early"", so I am super confused on how to proceed. 

Should ask my manager for a switch to another team, as this will result in severing whatever relationship I have built with my manager (which I might regret later). Or should I keep at it and see where this takes me. I guess it boils down to:

1. Is it recommended to work in a field that I see no future in yet, but does broaden my skill set? 
2. Will it put me at a disadvantage if I dont get direct exposure to datascience projects, if I do want to pursue datascience in future?
3. How are the future prospects of Automation/RPA in comparison with data science?
