books,"Bordering the west side of the village of Woods Edge lay a vast forest; giant trees densely packed together almost entirely uniform in size and foliage ,stretching into the night sky, the mist from the cold air licked the tops of the trees, giving the illusion that the tops reached the clouds themselves. The size of the forest and its grandeur is not something that can be overstated its sheer scope demanded respect in a way that only glorious nature can. To the villagers of Woods Edge however this forrest represented not the glory of nature but the danger of what lays beyond it. As ancient and as huge as it is, is not the divine work of nature but a purposeful wall and reminder of the past conflict that burned through Ameltyne eons ago. 

This forrest was aptly named the Scorched Woods, and scorched it was, totally devoid of colour; no green of the leaves no brown on the branches. The leaves never fell and flowers never bloomed. Birds didn’t sing and bees never buzzed. The forrest usually empty and silent, on this night had a visitor. In the middle of this wasteland was a curious sight, surrounded by the burnt trees was a pond around 15ft in size and almost perfectly circular, above it is what appeared to be a cleaning the tree canopy above which allowed the yellow moon to reflect perfectly in the water below; the water as clear as glass you’d be forgiven for thinking the moon itself was laying beneath the surface. Soft footsteps approached and out from the dense tree trunks emerged a young woman whose hair, even in the thick darkness was unmistakably the brightest shade of red, her lilac eyes darting around glistening in the small light the moon provided, whatever or whoever she was looking for did not appear to be there. She sat by the pond, legs crossed transfixed by the moon in the water, idly handling the large pendent hanging from her neck. Usually Marcy would be full of excitement to be there, this was a place that had brought her happiness and solace for the past twelve months. She was pretty sure it was only herself and Tommin, the person she was waiting for, who even knew that this place existed. Most if not all of the villagers of Woods Edge feared even entering and those who did almost certainly did not get this far in. 

The woods had a way to disorientate and confuse even the most skilled explorers, many who have ventured in are never seen again, some say they simply got lost and died of starvation, others with a much more active imagination suspect a somewhat more sinister cause for the unexplained disappearances. Superstitious to a fault the villagers of Woods Edge and the indeed the occupants of all the villages in Ameltyne thought it wise to observe the Scorched Woods from a far, after all it was there to keep them safe from the dangers on the other side not a space to investigate.",What do you think,1581718762

books,"If you are like me, you find Children of the Corn to be a particularly unsettling story. Contrary to other works of horror that follow rules of conventional literature, Children of the Corn defies the rules of possibly the biggest artistic movement in the west: Romanticism


Two of the basic elements of romanticism are the glorification of nature and children. Through the romanticist lens, children are the epitome of everything that is good and innocent, and nature and rural life are seen as the optimal state for man. The romanticist rules are present to pretty much all western works of literature either intentionally or vaguely but then Children of the Corn comes in and crushes both of these principles


Children are depicted as capable of the most gruesome murders just like adults, using knives and farm tools to cheerfully kill many innocents. This is what makes them so unsettling, the depiction of murderous children is very defiant of the dominant romanticist model that we are so used to.


Also, Rural life is not depicted as beautiful and peaceful. It's depicted as alienating, isolated and full of mystery and cults unseen by the city folk protagonists. This is yet another violation of romanticist rules, the unconventional enemies are placed in an unconventional setting, creating an eerie, uncanny story in the process.


So this is why Children of the Corn is so terrifying, It demonizes what we've come to know as beautiful and innocent and It challenges our view on literature. This is why I consider it, one of Stephen King's best works",Stephen King's Children of the Corn is a wonderful unprecedented reaction against romanticism,1581711514

I don’t like crying in real life (because tears are usually precipitated by an event that is, at best, fairly disappointing, and at worst, life-ruining) but I LOVE crying while I’m reading. This is because whenever I cry at the end of a book (or all throughout the book, on every other page if I’m lucky) it’s because the book in question has rocked me to my core and made my cold, dark heart actually FEEL something.

A book that can make me cry is a small miracle. Same with a TV show/movie/tiny play in a blackbox theater somewhere/big Broadway musical. It just doesn’t happen that often. A story has to more than engage me to make me cry, it has to straight up IMMERSE me. I have to be so nose-and-eyeballs deep in the story that I almost mistake the characters’ thoughts and feelings for my own. I don’t ever actually start believe I’m one of the characters. I’m crazy, but I’m not THAT kind of crazy. Still, if I’m crying over a book, it’s because the lines between fantasy and reality have blurred a bit. You don’t cry over something you KNOW is made up.

books,"Hi all.

I know there are other threads about this but hear me out. 

I have a pretty huge collection of books, and I love them. 

My wife and I were living in an apartment we had to move out of because she was intolerant of the mold. We got a new place with bookcases everywhere, even in the walls.

A lot of the move-in process has been throwing out or cleaning stuff from the old place. 

However . . . Yesterday I saw a bunch of my books in the trash with food on top of them and my bookshelf looked like it got beat up. I asked my wife what I could do with books that I didn't want her to throw away (first editions, etc.) and she said she was going to throw everything out unless it was only in this apartment. 

That ... Is not acceptable. 

I asked her what the alternative is and she told me ""put them in a storage unit out of here, or burn them..."" 

That's not acceptable either. So I started doing some research, and it sounds like she was onto something with the 'burn them' thing. A lot of people have said that they've put their books through a special oven at 200 degrees F or something to decontaminate them. I found one thread where the person mentioned they had a specific device for it but they never said what it was.

How can I fix this problem? They are mostly paperbacks. A friend suggested rotating them through a series of bins with a ton of dessicant packets but I don't know if that'll work. 

I also don't know if this kind of problem would affect the inside of the books. They're always on shelves or stacked on each other.. So the suggestion from some people to wipe the books with alcohol wipes on the outsides (as if they were a box) seems like it might be viable.

But is that true, that the mold wouldn't get inside the books? It's not visible on anything so it makes it hard to check.

  
I'm open to just about any solution at this point. If I need to spray them with disinfectant, and they become wettish then they get dried out and maybe get a little water damaged, even that is preferable to throwing all of them out.

Is there a spray that could do that without wetting the paper.. ? 

Help! My collection depends on it! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR list of questions: 

1- I saw someone mention a special oven they used for this - does anybody know a model number or anything?

2- Would putting them in a bin with dessicant packets work? 

3- Would this mold have gotten inside paperbacks (it's invisible)? 

4- If not, would wiping their outsides with alcohol swabs work?

5- Is there a spray that I could spray the whole book with that wouldn't make it wet and get water damaged?

6- Barring all of these methods, if I'm okay with damaged books as long as they're readable, what else can I do?

books,"I generally hear little about Waugh, occasionally that he was sexist/racist/generally offensive or something along those lines, but so were most people during the time he was writing and as someone who is mixed-race I honestly still find even his more racist jokes terribly funny, I think it’s because of the way he makes fun of everyone equally that it doesn’t feel offensive. 

I think the humour in all of his books is brilliant, it’s just so stupid and simple (like the ending of ‘A Handful of Dust’) that they’re usually quick but incredibly enjoyable reads.

Then again, he also writes beautifully and Brideshead Revisited has little bits of his usually silliness whilst also capturing so many different, more negative, emotions. The way he writes Ryder’s memories of the past in that book is just perfect. 

This:

&gt;”Just the place to bury a crock of gold,"" said &gt;Sebastian. ""I should like to bury something precious &gt;in every place where I've been happy and then, when &gt;I was old and ugly and miserable, I could come back &gt;and dig it up and remember."" 

is so indescribably lovely to me. Brideshead Revisited’s focus on Catholicism also reminds me of my childhood as I was raised in the religion, so it gives it a sort of cosy feel.

books,"I truly believe these might some of the most important words ever said. Carl Sagan had a way of seeing things for what they really are. This to me is the best description of that photo of earth taken billions of miles away. 

“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”

books,"So, *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* by French author Jules Verne. A classic adventure story, originally published in 1870. Verne, along with H.G. Wells is considered a founding figure in the Science Fiction genre and *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* fits that label nicely. New and imagined technologies that open up new worlds, check. Lots of scientific lingo, check. Relationships between humanity and technology thrown into sharp relief, ya sorta. 

To summarize, Professor Aronnax and his companions Ned Land, and the nameless Conseil, are captured by Capt. Nemo and the *Nautilus,* an ahead of its time submarine that roams the seven seas of the world at will. Capt. Nemo informs Aronnax and his companions that they can't leave, as Nemo has no intention of returning to land or regular human life and does not want his secret submarine or lifestyle to be revealed. Aronnax and companions are cool with this for a while, as they go where no people have gone before across the ocean, and have all sorts of adventures. Eventually they get fed up and try to escape. 

So how does this 150 year old book hold up (for me at least)? Well after finding it kind of a slog for 4/5ths of the book, the last 60 pages were absolutely incredible. Originally serialized (published in parts), the episodic nature of the chapters definitely lead to a meandering style that disregards the main plot line for large portions of the story. Of course, that was the point back then, and the sheer imagination Verne shows is truly impressive, if a little tedious to read at times. 

The story is told through the perspective of Professor Aronnax, so there are long passages of cataloguing marine flora and fauna, which I am sure were hugely impressive in 1870, but are pretty boring and occasionally inaccurate now (such as 30 foot sharks, violent manatees, and coordinated octopus attacks).

The characters are all relatively static. Aronnax is a professor and he has a scientific mind. Ned Land serves an angry and emotional foil to Aronnax's cool rationalism. Capt. Nemo is the dark and mysterious seaman who has separated himself from the world for reasons unknown. He also has, like, the strongest of plot armors. The Conseil is kind of a pitiful guy who represents the bonds of loyalty and service. He basically is just Aronnax's servant and devotee. They don't change much, or at all really and it makes them all kind of predictable imo. However, during the last 60 pages Verne really dives into the characters, and shows a greater depth for them which I wish had been there throughout. We see more of Nemo's backstory and psychological makeup, which takes him from a pseudo-god to a wounded and vengeance-driven man, while maintaining most of his mystery. Aronnax, Ned Land and the Conseil are all pushed to their mental brinks, due to their continued imprisonment on board, exposing their own salvos of dedication, honor and human desire for freedom. While not really changing the characters in any significant way, the last 60 pages do engage with them beyond their superficial actions.

One of the more interesting themes in *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* is environmental conservation. At various points in the book, one is given the impression that Capt. Nemo is deeply concerned with environmental conservation, such as when he decries the dwindling populations of Northern whales from the ocean, with Aronnax reflecting that ""these fisherman will one day cause the disappearance of the last whale in the ocean."" Very true, very woke. However, a few short paragraphs later, Capt. Nemo is happily ramming the *Nautilus* into Sperm Whales (who were attacking the other whales) because they are ""nothing but mouth and teeth."" Little bit of a lack of understanding about ecosystems, sure. Of course, the book was written in 1870, so judging it by today's standards is always going to expose some silly things. It's worth noting, though. As was the foolish claims earlier in the book, upon visiting a field of pearls in the Indian Ocean, that such an expansive field of pearls could never be exhausted by humanity. If only that were true. Human actions unfortunately seem all too linked with the demise of a whole lot of nature. The book gets about half the way there on these issues of conservation, which, for 1870, should maybe be applauded. Idk. 

Another interesting point, was a conversation between Aronnax and Ned Land, in which the rational Aronnax questions Ned Land's stories of mythological sea creatures. Aronnax claims that ""Nothing"" in the stories are true, ""at least of that which passes the limit of truth to get to fable or legend."" He finishes on an interesting note: ""Nevertheless, there must be some ground for the imagination of the story-tellers"" and isn't that just what Verne is doing in this book? Extending the realms of possibility, creating new fables, using the real-world as a jumping-point for the imagination. Of course, he is not claiming that *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* is nonfiction, but it's an interesting tidbit of meta-commentary. It makes me wonder what the reception was like for his stories? Was there a lot of fiction that left realism behind at that time? Was he criticized for writing these science-fiction stories? This was the time, after all, of the great realists, Dickens, The Bronte sisters, Hawthorne, Melville etc etc. If anyone knows please correct/inform me. 

Anyways, here's a collection of my favorite lines:

*""What a freak of nature! A bird's beak on a mollusc!""*

*""I held my head between my hands to keep it from bursting.""*

*""If this destiny be strange, may it also be sublime.*""

*""The moon was then passing the meridian. Jupiter was rising in the east. Amid this peaceful scene of nature. sky and ocean rivaled each other in tranquility, the sea offering to the orbs of night the finest mirror they could ever have in which to reflect their image.""*

So that's it. Overall it is a fun adventure book with some serious themes and some worn tropes, but considering that the book probably invented some of these tropes, it's almost a historical document. The ending was nothing other than fantastic, even if it took a while to build to that point. Thanks for reading this whole thing if you did. I am definitely reading *Journey to the Center of the Earth* at some point.

There is more depth to the story and to the characters -especially the women. I found the location and the historical authenticity of the background fascinating and the quotations at the beginning of the chapters interesting and relevent.

books,"I  recently read a book called Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine. The lady has some serious cptsd, and has isolated herself from people pretty thoroughly. She decides to change some things. For a ridiculous reason of course, but she is able to change her life for the better. Of course, being fiction, all the solutions were within reach.

I used to play The Sims. It was pretty obvious from the start that I was not going to be able to learn how to be human from that. Books are often touted as life changing. People talk about how they have learned this or that from a book. How reading books by different demographic groups will expand your horizons and help you understand different perspectives. In my experience, the things you can learn from books are no more relevant to real life than The Sims.

Eleanor was able to talk to the people around her, and learned that she could have friends and family and happiness if she just reached out a little. What utter bullshit. For me, at least.

Your world is no larger than it was before, just because you can see farther into the distance. If you live in a rural area, can't drive, and have no friends or family, books like that just make the cage feel smaller. Your world is your world.

books,"I'm currently writing a developmental economics essay on inequality in Latin America. During my research I came across (what the author claimed to be) a Pablo Neruda quote:  
 ""For the thieving nobleman, privilege – for the man who steals bread, jail""  
The only place I can find that quote used (or translation used) is on other economics development articles, and they are of the same length and same translation (I suspect they probably copied it off the first article to post it).  
I can't work out whether this is a legitimate quote, or whether (in typical developmental economist) style somebody has either made it up or got such a skewed translation it's objectively unfaithful to the text.

books,"I am currently picking my way through David Raeburn’s translation of Metamorphoses for the first time and I am thoroughly enjoying it so far. I have a very basic knowledge of Greek mythology and hardly any knowledge of Roman Gods/Goddess/Lore. I was just wondering if anyone knows of some helpful resources to accompany the book. 

The notes often provide insight of each new character but I was wondering if there existed an infographic or a good comprehensive list that shows lineage because it seems everyone is related or at least intertwined so it is a little confusing to keep it all straight.

Despite getting tripped up on such things, I am still enjoying the stories even if I miss a lot of the finer details and wit that is sometimes injected in the language/references.

books,"I just read the graphic novel *Persepolis* by Marjane Satrapi and WOW, I can definitely say I was moved! The novel is set during the Islamic Revolution during the 1980s in Iran. You are put in the shoes of young Marjane Satrapi as she discovers the hardships of coming of age in Iran during that time. Satrapi aids her story with illustrations in which you can visually engage with the events that unfold throughout the story. Satrapi deals with things such as religion, equality, feminism, love, family, Peer/Societal pressures, and much more. These factors have influenced her surroundings which ultimately shapes her coming of age experience. 

After reading the graphic novel my Opinion on Iran has changed quite dramatically. To begin with, I did not know much information about the rule of the Islamic regime let alone knowing different opinions from different viewpoints. It is very easy to get wrapped up in what’s going in your own life than what is going on globally. Reading *Persepolis* is an eye-opening experience, especially if you have only seen media propaganda that has a primary purpose to make people believe that Iran is the enemy rather than serve a much moral purpose of showing the true realities of Iran. 

I have posted this thread here to see other people’s opinions on the graphic novel as well as the political situations that have been in an issue in Iran to this day. Do you think her environment influenced her coming of age? What if it was written during a different time period? Additionally, If anyone has any similar stories in which they can relate to Satrapi would be amazing to read!",Persepolis discussion (SPOILER ALERT),1581683735

Engaging style and very comprehensive. It went into the details of the political/cultural/social circumstances, especially between the 60's and the 70's in the USA. Besides, it expressed very well Ali's positive traits but also his dark side.
