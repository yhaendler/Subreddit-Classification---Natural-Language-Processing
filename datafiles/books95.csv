books," So, i'm midway through the third book in the series and i’m not really enjoying it as much as I thought i would. I see so many people praising the books and yet I can't get myself to like it as much.  Don't get me wrong, it's not like it's the worst book I've read, it's just that it's simply not that great. 
I really like the world building, but apart from that, nothing really caught my attention. The characters are enjoyable, but I don't think any of them is too unique. The writing sometimes is just... not the best, i don't think, and the romance is really off to me.
I guess I'm a little disappointed, because I really thought this would be one of the best reads of the year, but it really isn't. I'd love to know other people's opinions on this.",Scythe by Neal Shusterman,1618876615

A week or so ago, I was looking for a book they didn't have and I accidentally clicked 'Recommend' on the listing. I didn't see a way to remove the recommendation.

Today I got a notification that it was available and ready for me to check out. Which I'm pretty excited about. 

But did I 'make' my library/state library buy that E-Book? Might they have been able to get a digital loan from another system like they potentially could for a physical book? I feel kinda guilty if they bought a copy of the somewhat niche book I wanted. Should I feel guilty? 

I guess my question is two part: 

How does this process work?

books,"I do a lot of coffee chats and meet a lot of new people. I try to virtually meet at least 2-3 new people a week.

90% of the conversations come off as business-purpose driven. It’s either to learn about a subject matter area, brainstorm and discuss ideas, or provide insight on a topic. 

**The remaining 10% are free-flow chats — these are the conversations I love most.**

Obviously, the lack of purpose can make it feel futile or awkward, but with the right steer, you can have great conversations too.

\---

**Here are some case studies, principles, and anecdotes behind having a great conversation:**

## Be present, be curious

&gt;Brandon Stanton is the author, photographer, and content creator behind [**Humans of New York**](https://www.humansofnewyork.com/) **(HONY).** He was named Time Magazine’s “30 Under 30 People Changing the World” and has taken hundreds of portraits of people in more than 20 countries across the world.

I recently listened to [Tim Ferriss’s podcast, where he interviews Brandon Stanton and discusses his journey](https://tim.blog/2018/06/18/brandon-stanton-humans-of-new-york/) on the challenges and roadblocks he encountered.

I’d highly encourage you listen to it if you haven’t already. It’s a great anecdote on facing adversity, battling self-doubt, and following your passion.

I’ve listened to it four times. Start at **66:00** if you’re short on time.

Brandon started off with a goal: **to photograph 10,000 New Yorkers on the street and create a catalog of the city’s inhabitants**. Along the way, he began to interview his subjects in addition to photographing them.

It took him 7 years to complete this project.

**Today, HONY is a blog, Instagram page, published book, global brand, and much more.**

What you’ll immediately notice, is that the stories are real tear-jerkers. These are some of the most emotional and vulnerable stories — featuring people’s deepest, darkest secrets.

The incredible thing is that Brandon typically learns these stories during his first interaction with them.

**We’re all familiar with the axiom:**

&gt;Empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight

Brandon has exponentially increased our line of sight through HONY. He’s managed to create empathy, humanize tens of thousands of people across the world, and paint a more accurate picture of humanity.

It takes an incredible amount of skill and dedication to do what Brandon has accomplished, and through thousands of conversations, Brandon has effectively mastered the art of connecting with strangers. He’s developed the ability to empower people to be comfortable enough to deeply open up, in just 30 minutes.

#### How does he do it?

In Brandon’s own words:

&gt;“How you get to that deep place with a person is… **Absolute presence**.  
It’s being 100% there. You’re not thinking in the framework of an interview. You’re not looking at a list of questions. You’re not thinking about your next question. You’re not thinking about how this person fits into your idea of them and what you know about them.  
**You’re 100% there and you’re 100% listening to them.** And your questions are based on the curiosity of what they’re telling you, and nothing else.”  
— Brandon Stanton

For someone to deeply share with you, they have to be extremely comfortable in the presence of a stranger — somebody they’ve just met. They have to feel you’re truly interested, that you know them and care about them.

#### How can you apply this?

Next time you’re having a conversation with someone:

* Ditch a comprehensive question list and framework; have initial questions or topics, then let it flow from there.
* Let natural curiosity drive the conversation. “How” and “Why” questions are always great for digging deeper.
* Practice empathy. Put yourself in their shoes and **truly** visualize what it’d be like from their perspective.
* Use [active listening techniques](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-active-listening-3024343) to encourage them to keep talking and sharing.
* **Be fully present in the conversation. All that exists during the moment is: you and them. Nothing else matters.**  


Your goal should be to create a safe space for conversation and sharing. Be fully present, and demonstrate genuine curiosity and interest.

\---

### Ask insightful questions

I previously mentioned that it’s **not** always about the questions and it may seem like I’m contradicting myself. To clarify: questions are a tool to begin the conversation and explore deeper conversation topics.

It’s about the quality of the questions you use to begin with. Ask **insightful questions.**

**Insightful questions are questions that:**

1. Prompt the person to think deeply about something
2. Are relevant and reflective of the subject at hand
3. Can ignite a conversation

I consider Tim Ferriss the master of asking questions and I’ve mentioned Tim a couple of times in my writing. I think he deserves a proper introduction:

&gt;Tim Ferris is an author, podcast host, and entrepreneur who focuses on performance, optimization, self-development, and business.  
He’s the author of [4-Hour Workweek](https://fourhourworkweek.com/), [Tools of Titans](https://toolsoftitans.com/), and [Tribe of Mentors](https://tribeofmentors.com/) (all my favorite books!).

The idea behind his podcasts and books is that he interviews the world’s top performers in various disciplines — athletics, business, science, mathematics, and so forth — and picks their brains on routines, habits, and behaviors they use to optimize their life.

He’s probably interviewed most celebrities and influencers that you’ve heard of.

&gt;[Jamie Foxx talks about how Kanye blew up](https://tim.blog/2015/12/06/jamie-foxx/)  
[Daniel Ek (Spotify CEO) discusses how to scale a company](https://tim.blog/2020/12/03/daniel-ek/)  
[Naval Ravikant shares wisdom on general business, life, and happiness](https://tim.blog/2020/10/14/naval/)

**Through hundreds of interviews, he’s mastered the art of asking good, insightful questions. Often, this is the key to extracting wisdom from experts.**

1. Here is the list of 10 insightful questions he asks in interviews:
2. What is the book (or books) you’ve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?
3. What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months (or in recent memory)? My readers love specifics like brand and model, where you found it, etc.
4. How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a “favorite failure” of yours?
5. If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it — metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions — what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph. (If helpful, it can be someone else’s quote: Are there any quotes you think of often or live your life by?)
6. What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve ever made? (Could be an investment of money, time, energy, etc.)
7. What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?  
In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life?
8. What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the “real world”? What advice should they ignore?
9. What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?
10. In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to (distractions, invitations, etc.)? What new realizations and/or approaches helped? Any other tips?
11. When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? (If helpful: What questions do you ask yourself?)

**What are the common threads between these questions?**

1. They all require deeper thought to answer (can you answer any of these questions immediately?)
2. They’re all interesting questions that can spark off into a separate, deeper discussion.
3. They all touch on the themes of growth, decision-making, and learning — which is Tim’s domain.

&gt;**Jumping back to Brandon’s technique, here are the 3 questions he uses to kick off the conversation:**  
What’s your biggest struggle?  
How has your life turned out differently than you expected it to?  
What do you feel most guilty about?

Brandon uses these questions as an entry point into the conversation. Often, he’ll start with one of these questions and monitor interest signals from the person to decide which topics to dig deeper into.

Tim uses a similar technique. He kicks off with one of his questions, goes deeper into the idea, then brings the interviewee back out, and pivots into the next subject.

#### How can you apply this?

1. **Create a ‘question bank’ of your favorite questions to use in different settings** (e.g. interviews, coffee chats, regular conversations) — continuously refine and vet this list.
2. **Prioritize your questions** — if you could only ask 1 question, which would it be? Some conversations tunnel in one direction so I always ask my most important questions first.
3. **Use ‘How’ and ‘Why’ questions to understand more deeply.** For any stories that involve change — whether it involves moving countries or changing jobs — I always try to understand the ‘Why’ — what sparked the change? And the ‘How’ — how did they do it?
4. **Ask open-ended questions to keep it broad.** This allows the person to choose what they’d like to talk about and signals what is most important to them.

Tie these principles together:

Do your preparation ahead of time and understand what good, insightful questions are. During the conversation, be fully present and refer to these questions as needed. Remember that pre-meditated questions just serve as a tool to kick off the conversation into something deeper.

books,"Last year I read the sea of fertility and whilst I adored spring snow and cherished the last two. I couldn’t find myself liking runaway horses, I felt it was very long and extremely blunt when it came to presenting Mishima’s ideas. I thought it was quite literal where Mishima used the protagonist to share and explore his ideas where I’d rather prefer them being presented through symbolism, metaphors or semantic fields. 


There were aspects of the book I did enjoy (the description, the characters) however the negatives outweighed the positives for me. It possibly didn’t help that some people claimed this book to be the best of the tetralogy and scored it “5/5” this affected my expectations of the book and let me down.

books,"I'm not saying I don't like reading a YA novel every now and then, but it seems like everything is about YA nowadays (well, on the internet at least).

If you ask for book recommendations, the majority you'll get will be YA. Unless you specifically ask people not to, you'll get Harry Potter recommended around 50 times. You'll also get books along the same lines. 

And in discussions on favourite books or books generally, it's mostly people in their 20s and 30s bringing up YA and who are the ones talking about it.

I'm not trying to be disrespectful, if you like it you like it. But it seems to be a growing trend online, and some people are talking about how it's all they read and how they can't enjoy other types of books or move passed YA. Like if you believe what people say in online book circles, adults are stuck on books that they grew up with and on YA longer than they used to be. It used to be that I'd never hear adults speaking about a teen fantasy book, except to say that their kids liked it. Of course that's all anecdotal though.

And people complain that the plots aren't fantastic or too shallow, and that they're similar, and it's like, yeah, it's YA. Some of them are fantastic, but largely they're popcorn books.

I'm not saying you have to read massive philosophy books every day or anything like that, but isn't it weird that books aimed at teens are being consumed largely by adults?

books,"I’ve never been much of a reader, at least not of books. (I can spend hours reading obscure Wikipedia articles and things like that). However, I’d like to start reading. I was wondering if anyone could give me any recommendations?

As for my personal tastes and interests, I love horror films, especially the classics of the 1930s, but I don’t know if that’s the kind of stuff I’d like to read in a book. I like the murder mystery genre, but I’m not SUPER into it since most of those aren’t really as character driven and interesting and a lot seem kind of “cookie cutter.”

I like things that are generally on the darker side but I prefer to have very like-able and interesting characters. Like I said, I don’t read a lot of books but I remember absolutely loving Harry Potter as a kid, and I think that’s because it had horror adjacent themes, and very interesting and developed characters. The problem with this is that when I say I enjoyed Harry Potter, I always get recommended these real cheesy coppycat type books that just feel like teen dramas.

I also LOVE classic ghost stories like The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and others, but those usually aren’t very long and still dont really have the character driven style that I dig. 

My taste is very particular and I’ve struggled finding things to read. Any recommendations would be wonderful, and I’d be happy to answer any questions to help find the right type of book for me.",I’d like to start reading.,1618849625
books,"I'm not sure if this has been asked here before, but recently I've read some books that I feel like i should have read much earlier for me to appreciate them better. For example I listened to the Percy Jackson series, and while the books are great, i would have absolutely loved them if i had read them at 5th or 6th grade. I could have had this awesome out of the world feeling while reading them. ( I am in my early twenties now)

Another example is the Mortal Instruments series. I'm on the second book and i think its alright but i know how obsessed I would've been with this series if I read them at high school, it would've felt more awesome and more magical.

These books made me realise that there's a right book for the right time. I'm afraid of how many more awesome books I'll miss out on or not appreciate them enough because i should have read them much earlier. I loved the fanstasy genre but now it feels like I'm growing out of it, and i dont know what to go for next. Its a huge FOMO. I wanna know people's views on this, if anyone else has felt the same too.

books,"Hello! I’m trying to remember the title of a YA book I really loved a few years ago but have been unable to find it using possible key words, but I do have a general description of the cover and content.

It was hardcover when I was reading around maybe 2017. The spine was part bright blue and part light purple, with a comic book style cover. Think black and white lines separating bright different colours.

The plot follows a female protagonist, who attend this fancy school with smart students where she has this hated enemy named Ben? or something who’s always competing with her. Their friends get tired of the feuding and hatch this plan that helps them become a couple. 

I know the title is something like “I hate everything about you” “you are the worst” something kind of like that.

Please let me know if you recognize this description! Thanks :)",Does anyone know what this book is called?,1618849351

books,"Sometimes I realize my imagination lazily reuses a setting I imagined for one book and applies it for another story where the details kinda fit (adapting where it needs tweaking). It's a bit like my head had this range of prototypical streets, houses, or parks. The example that made me realize that process was my tendency to pick The Simpson's house as my default house. When a story needs me to picture a house, I have often caught myself being lazily drawn to a house I already know perfectly, rather than imagining one from scratch.

Now I'm very curious. Have you noticed similar prototypes your imagination tends to use? Or do you systematically imagine a new setting for each new story? How often do you tend to draw from a pre-existing database?",To what extent do you recycle the settings you imagined for one book to another?,1618848822

books,"It's been my dream to own  [this](https://www.stellabooks.com/books/charles-dickens/a-christmas-carol-803200/2123502) 2003 Folio Society edition, but I can't seem to find it at a good price (+shipping and customs; I live on Southern Europe) or just can't find it at all in good shape. 

I've been looking at other opinions but can't decide since most don't tell if they have illustrations, sometimes I don't like the cover, but worse is that some just look like fragile bindings.

So I was wondering if anyone here has any suggestions as to what editions I should look at.  

Preferences:

-Hardcover,  but I'm not opposed to good paperbacks; 
- Decent looking covers, can be something that looks like it's for kids, as long as it relates to the story
- Illustrations are a plus, not exactly necessary.

I've looked at the puffin clothbound classics and it's the one I'm leaning towards ( I have no idea if it has illustrations) the binding looks good, the cover is beautiful IMO. Anyone owns one that can tell me how it is? Any other suggestions?

books,"So, I've published my first book *Broken Humanity* and I'm really happy to have finished it nearly a year from now. The story I wrote is a sci-fi story, but it's related to reality because it has several projections on events that happened, are happening, and will happen in the future based on the changes we are experiencing lately.

I've discussed many issues in *Broken Humanity* such as racism and the impact that can do on human beings, class disparity and how it can destroy society, the treasure of humanity is the kids, and to control these little pure creatures means that the future is under the controller's hands; on the other side, to lead the adults, their sights have to be controlled, and being near your child can be better than medical treatment.

The story has a second part in my mind, but I really need your opinion about the story because that will encourage me to continue writing. Thank you.",Broken Humanity,1618843482
books,"One can be forgiven for calling me a hater if certain books targeted at teenagers with the wish fulfillment protagonists, thirsty love interests and overly dramatic bad guys to make our heroes seem good. So let me talk about one of my favorite books, The Outsiders. 

We follow high schooler Ponyboy Curtis living in a 1960s midwest town where he belongs to one of two high school groups, the delinquent greasers who are rivals with the rich and preppy Socs (pronounced soshes not ""socks""). And this is what I love about the story; its a about high schooler with high school problems. Ponyboy gets jumped in the beginning by socs and we sympathize and vilify the socs yet Ponyboy ends up connecting with a socs girl Cherry, but thank god the connection was more of mutual understanding of each others problems and not of love at first sight! The plot starts to unfold when ponyboy's BFF Johnny runs away and he and Ponyboy are again jumped by socs, leading to a big accident. 

Actions have consequences, and the author (and only being a teenager when she wrote it) understood this. We root and cheer for Ponyboy and his fun cast of buddies, yet their actions always end up in disaster for logical reasons. Much like real life, the only victory Ponyboy sees is the hard lessons he learns from tragedy and boy is there a lot of that here. Like most teenagers, he is young and shy and both cautious of the world and others yet curious. He isn't the strongest nor the smartest, he isn't the leader of the greasers, he is just a kid trying to make sense of it all. Which even as an adult, has me relating to him. 

 I think where YA really shines is seeing a lost young person, trying to make sense of the world where he is told one thing by adults and another by people his own age. Hell, that still happens as adult.",The Outsiders by SE Hinton,1618842625
