books,"\-So, I began a new hobby of reading while I fished, and it has enhanced both activities to a degree I find pure pleasure in. I read The Book of Eels last week while angling, and this week I decided to begin the Bible simply because I want to make it through all of the world's most important books before I die one day. It was a sunny, yet windy day in Connecticut, and being on the water brought peace with the readings.

\-Genesis is thought to be the first of a 5 part series by the ancient author and prophet Moses. As the name implies, it is a book of beginnings and origins. I am a believer in science, and wholeheartedly proclaim that evolution has been life's ultimate super-power, yet I found the stories of Creation and Adam to be quite intimate. I think metaphorically speaking, there is a lot to unpack, and I don't really find too much strife between Creation and Evolution if one looks at the Genesis story as alligorical. I mean the sun isn't even created until the 4th day, so obviously we aren't talking about stict 24 hour days of creation here. It made me pause to appreciate the aquatic world around me, especially with the autumn season causing the vibrant trees to mirror off the lake. God seems to have had aspirations of having an intimate relation with us, his prized creation, and I think in this day and age that gets lost on us amongst all the arguments of who is right and wrong, and damned or saved. This right here is the crux of Genesis and the Bible, and maybe even the Spirit world. All other themes aside, that is beautiful.

\-In Genesis, we see the first sin, the first murder, the first civilizations, the first prophecies, the first judgements, and so forth. We see lineages who follow the God of the Bible interacting with tribes who follow other religions. I think for the fan of history, that is incredibly valuable. Even of one is not a believer, this Book has an immense amount of historical worth. 50 chapters of one of the oldest writings, and yet it takes so much effort even to crack open these Books of Spirituality in modern times. We don't see the holy Books as a necessary read much anymore, and often talking about them has become taboo. We are missing out. Even reading chapter 49, wowsers. So much mystery in antiquity.

\- Several pumpkinseed sunfish slowly waft by. I untangle the concept of the Trinity as I also untangle my line. I think I get it. God says ""Let us make man in OUR image"" meaning God is at least a multi-set being. Assuming God is the traditional Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) if we are a reflection of God, we should be triune ourselves. Physically, we have a body (Son) and with the Breath of Life a soul (Father). I suppose our Spirit would be our personalities, or that which seperates us as individuals? I am not sure, but I think the concept isn't as messy as some believe it to be.

\- The true Scriptures are graphic. We forget the stories of Dinah or Tamar. The Children of Israel are also chuckleheads who luckily are blessed because of the faith of their fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Israel who could be a clown himself. The heroes of Genesis are pretty ordinary mistake makers like you and I, outside of maybe Abraham and Joseph. The warriors of the Iliad, they are not. God's holy line of believers were pretty brutal- Dinah is raped or taken to wife by a non-Hebrew prince, and to exact vengeance they decieve him and his kingdom into being circumsized by the Hebrew custom, and slay them all as they are sore and recovering. That's some Game of Thrones work there.

\- Through it all, Genesis sets us on a foundation where the rest of the Bible will build. I watch my line blow lazily in the breeze as the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. A lot is said through the subtle and the simple. We live in a world now seemingly rife with chaos, and yet the ingredients are still there in nature and the spiritual realm to find peace and comfort. I didn't catch shit today, but that's ok. Abraham waited over 100 years for his promised son, and was asked in a test, to slay him. While the Bible may not always be taken literally, Genesis shows us the truths behind patience and sacrifice. And love. Maybe even faith. 

\-I hope I have not offended anyone by my new report. I would be interested in hearing some viewpoints or things I may have missed. Keep your lines tight. The cold October waves still yield plenty of trout if one has faith. Stay blessed, and find your nature.",Read The Book of Genesis while I fished,1602285825

books,"(14 F) I used to read a book every week as a child but I stopped at age ten and haven't really picked up a book since. I loved reading but now I have the attention spam of a fly so I find that when I'm reading I don't actually understand what's happening in the story unless I read over it multiple times.

books,"This year I have read about 15 books, with around 12-13 of those being in the past month. I just really got back into reading and it was easy to maintain now it’s becoming a chore. 

I’m finding it so difficult to focus and I have this feeling of dread whenever I think of reading, almost as if it has become this thing I have to do rather than a hobby. 

I have adhd, among other things, so focusing is really difficult for me, as well as actually getting myself to make that first step and pick the book up. it’s also very normal for me to hyperfocus on a hobby for a few weeks then just get bored &amp; stop. 

I’m so desperate for that not to happen here though, as I enjoy reading so much and as a very introverted person it’s something that I want to spend more time doing.

books,"Some disclaimers: Infinite Jest's review is longer, not because I'm a college aged white guy who thinks it's my Bible, but because it's an edited down version of an email I sent to a high school teacher who recommended it to me. I also read plays and reviewed them during this time, but took those reviews out.


**Kitchen Confidential**: Fucking excellent book, great insights and narrative by Bourdain. Totally read it in his voice. Balances the biographical and informational very well.

**Dune**: Brilliant world building, it’s legacy speaks for itself. The political aspects of this story are what make it so special and important.

**Kafka on the Shore**: Awesome storytelling strategy of alternating chapters and connecting with war mystery. Crazy surrealist elements and interesting metaphors. A little on the nose and overly sexual, but well fleshed out characters. Murakami is an extremely matter of fact writer which takes some getting used to.

**Blood Meridian**: Incredible prose that makes you work and smile to understand. Gruesome and subtle.

**East of Eden**: Somehow makes you care about every member of the families over all three generations. Ending made me cry and the little world that Steinbeck creates is both natural and engaging. “Kind of about wanting to escape who you are and not being able to but other people being okay with that”

**Guards, guards!**: Hilarious, well fleshed out characters and dialogue. Super fun to read.

**Wind Up Bird Chronicle**: Interesting backstories for characters and dream sequences. Not entirely satisfying and seems too long for the themes it was trying to convey. Murakamis still a beast, though. The war story sticks with you.

**Fun Home**: Bechtel is a fun, striking writer/artist and paints an incredible portrait of a family that is probably not too unusual, but becomes entirely unique.

**The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down**: Great ethnography about Hmong culture and American healthcare. Balances both sides, gives detailed history of Hmong, good sense of humor.

**Infinite Jest**: Before anything else, I think a good disclaimer would be that I have been fortunate enough in my own life not to have personally dealt with the two main themes IJ deals with: depression and addiction. But in that sense, Wallace does a wonderful job of illuminating them for those who have not faced them. The book goes into addiction and AA culture in great depth, with many sections of the book being dedicated to one-off stories of addiction from both those at AA meetings (and various subsets of the group) and those at the Ennet House where much of the novel takes place. A great majority of the iconic endnotes at the back of the book are just descriptions of the exact substance a character is talking about, including the company that made it and the exact scientific dose.

There are similarly lengthy excerpts just talking about depression/”ennui” in general, aside from when he talks of specific people’s depression. Half of the story is a loose yet vivid allegory to Hamlet, specifically the part that takes place at the Enfield Tennis Academy with the (arguable) main character Hal. I mean, the title of the freakin’ book is from the “alas poor Yorick” monologue, it’s not like Wallace was hiding the relation there.
        
I LOVED the maximalist style of this book: the endnotes, the deep dive-ins to minor characters, the scientific journal style of some of the novel/endnotes, the way that Wallace’s grammar and syntax would change depending on what character he was talking about (even in the third person). That kinda stuff is just right up my alley. I wouldn’t necessarily call it immersive, but definitely enjoyably extensive. That’s definitely one of the more polarizing parts of the book: I’ve seen folks say that much of the book could have been cut down to reduce fluff and frustration. But to me, that’s missing some of the point. Wallace gives you all this extraneous, detailed information about the world not just to help us infer some narrative questions we have at the end, but to include the reader as part of the storytelling process itself. This book is aware that you are reading it, if that makes sense. I honestly don’t know if that does.

Gosh, this fuckin’ book. The more I try to write about it the more impossible it seems to, but I imagine that’s expected. This book really had me laughing out loud a lot. Along with everything else, it’s definitely a satire with some seriously tight-nit writing. The foreword said that “there is not a lazy sentence in this book” and they were correct. But man, it is easy to miss really important information about the story if you’re not careful. The “ending” of the book that helps you infer what happens to the characters is in the first 100 pages. There’s wraiths. There’s floating dudes who lick your sweat off. There’s ginormous feral hamsters. Time is subsidized. There’s descriptions of rape, animal abuse, violence, and drug use that don’t pull their punches. Wallace predicted Netflix, Facetime, and honestly parts of the Trump presidency.

Wallace’s writing may be extraneous, but I’ll be goddamned if he was not one of the most lucid voices of hypermodernity, sincerity, and addiction I’ve ever read. It seriously pains me reading this book, which focuses so much on depression, knowing Wallace’s fate. But this book has seriously changed the way I view literature, and life I guess. Of course that would be different for an older, more well-read fellow like yourself.  But that’s just literature, too. And it gives me joy that his legacy gets to live on in this way, where I can find out about a cool as hell book from a cool as hell high school English teacher and read it a couple years down the line. And I’ll definitely read it again.

**The Hobbit**: Fun, easy book to read. Something I wanna read to kids someday. A bit dated language and pacing but really enjoyable. I liked how Smaug wasn’t the end-all conflict.

**Lord of the Rings Trilogy**: High fantasy is just satisfying to read: the respectful dialogue, distinctions of races/lore, interesting places. Really subverts expectations plot-wise in regards to the ending, making it actually more realistic and melancholy. Just a good story clearly told with love and attention to detail.

**Chapo Guide to Revolution**: Just good takes for the most part. Voice can get a little over the top and requires you to know a lot about online political discourse and history in order to get a lot of the humor. Great artwork.

**The Brothers Karamazov**: Incredibly interesting look at late Tsarist Russia, and how Dostoyevsky was responding to changes in Orthodox Russian Christianity and socialism. All the characters are realistically confusing and contradictory. The stories like the Grand Inquisitor and Zosima’s life story are super interesting. Pretty funny at some points, like Snerigov not accepting the money and how the women act. Very heartfelt, real and human. Lots of cool philosophy and religious ideas.

**Dear Committee Members**: funny book entirely written in letters of recommendations. Funny, smart, sustains the tone and has good message of the decline of academia and the acceptance of failure. Would recommend as a quick read.

**True Hallucinations**: Shroom theory. Well written with an interesting narrative, but definitely an (enjoyable) slog due to the psychedelic subject matter and alchemical jargon. Interesting ideas and a unique window into intellectual hippie culture of the 70s.

**The Name of the Wind**: Cheesy, fun fantasy. Cool world building, cool magic system, mostly cool prose with some over-the-top, unsubtle stuff. Kvothe is a pretty boring protagonist since he’s just good at everything or gets good at everything. Still an engaging read that I wanted to finish even tho it wasn’t that satisfying.

**Truth in Comedy**: great beginners manual for improv, every person unfamiliar with improv should read.

**Song of Solomon**: Very interestingly written, occasional non chronological jumps. Incredible perspective on the connections black people have made to their past in America, and a refreshing look at female sexuality. Crazy characters that are still entirely believable.

**Of Mice and Men**: Wonderful short read, tragic and illuminating about working class issues. Surprisingly deep characters for such a short book.

**Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**: A book that was definitely important for its time in terms of its philosophy and its new views on technology and education. Hasn’t aged super well, has some fallacies in his points. I’ve realized I don’t always like books when the protagonist KNOWS they’re the protagonist. Gets a little annoying. This is deflected a bit by talking about Phaedrus in 3rd person but it’s a bit pretentious regardless. I enjoyed the actual narrative of the trip a lot, and his ideas of quality and gumption are both useful. Found myself zoning out a lot while reading, but more because the book made me think a lot rather than it being uninteresting. Tricks you into learning philosophy. Very unique narrative and philosophy for the time, with a cool ending.

**Catcher in the Rye**: Such an interesting narrative style and likely revolutionary at the time. A surprisingly touching look at what depression can look like, and the sort of layered feelings of teenage boys.

**Slaughterhouse Five**: wonderfully funny and morbid while remaining concise in its themes and ideas. Enjoyed the non chronological storytelling and narrative voice.

**Stretching My Mind**: collection of Edward Albee essays largely concerning artists and the collection/creation of art. Some great interviews dealing with critics, writing, and American culture.

**In Cold Blood**: Cool book that really views the crime and characters from all angles. Sometimes wished we could see directly how Capote fit into the events but I get why he kept himself out of the book. Just a wonderfully extensive and interesting read.

**Circe**: I forgot how much of a sucker I am for Greek mythology: used to be a big Percy Jackson so I suppose it’s the natural next step. The writing style at first left me wary, but it was so masterfully used that it really sucks you in. Awesome depth to characters and reimagining of classics.

**Men at Arms**: Forgot how much I love Terry Pratchett. Hilarious, clever, and really engaging read. So much fun and such great new characters!

**Mitterhal’s Post**: a very unique and creative book written by my friends father. Part 1 is a slow burn and surreal and Part 2 is more narrative driven. Fun world building that lets you put the pieces together yourself. Fun focus on characterization.

**No Country for Old Men**: I had already seen the movie, so reading the book made me respect the movie more. felt like I was reading a screenplay some times. Some of my favorite dialogue out of anything I’ve read. All the characters are fleshed out almost entirely through action and dialogue which was incredible.","From my 18th birthday to my 20th, I wrote short book reviews immediately after finishing them.

books,"I'm a big fan of Jemison, having read Inheritance and Broken Earth both as well as some of her short fiction. In both of her previous series I really appreciated the diversity that was present in the  in her characters. 

So going in I knew she would have a lot of ethnic, gender and LGBTQ representation. What I don't think I was prepared for was to see all white characters portrayed as a stereotype! I found it so throwing. I really found the book harder to engage with, even as an experienced reader who had some expectations of how ""my"" group would likely be represented.

It's one thing to read a book without a white guy in it, that's rare of course but in SF or Fantasy not crazy.  Of course, half the books one could name without a white guy in it have a ""white guy in disguise"" as it were. What I mean by that is something like Watership Down, which is technically all about rabbits, but they speak, think and act like white males.

But with The City We Became, every time a white character was introduced I wondered what sterotype they were going to represent. Even with my openness to diverse viewpoint fiction I found it seriously off-putting to not be able to see myself represented positively in the text! It was a tiny window into what it would probably be like to go through a ""traditional"" (classic Euro-focused) English curriculum as a student of color or alternate gender identity. Never feeling like you can put yourself in the shoes of the hero, and being immediately defensive when someone who *is* like you is introduced in the text, waiting to see how they will be represented as a caricature has to be a huge barrier to accessing literature.

I'm a teacher (Science) and so I knew this intellectually and tried to work to prevent it in my lessons by highlighting the accomplishments of women and minorities in science, but The City We Became took what was an idea and gave it real context for me.

That felt a little like a ramble, so I hope that made sense.",The City We Became by N.K. Jemison taught me what it was like for a minority to read mainstream fiction,1602250784

books,"Hello!

This year I read 'Carrying the Fire' by Michael Collins - he was the guy that stayed in the command module while Neil and Buzz went down to the moon on Apollo 11. It was a great read, and gave an insiders perspective to most of the Apollo program, with just enough technical information to show how much of a feat of engineering it was.

Now I am almost finished with 'The Right Stuff' by Tom Wolfe. It is a behind the scenes-y, Tom Wolfey overview of the Mercury program. It's a good read but a bit stylized and sensational. It does give a good overall idea of the Mercury program though.

So now I realize that I know nothing about the Gemini program, the shuttle program, or the Soviet space program. Or the space stations. I know the shuttle and space stations aren't likely as dramatic or high-stakes and the late fifties through the 60's, but I'd still like to round out my understanding. 

I am looking for a book on each, as close to the tone of 'Carrying the Fire' as I can find. I really liked the insider's view, the way the technical information was presented, and the writing style. They don't need to be autobiographical. 

So, any recommendations for a book on the Soviet space program from sputnik on? Gemini, Skylab, ISS, and the Shuttles? Any other books on specific events or eras that would be worth a look?

I am currently reading The Dark Tower and its related books. As I was going through the series I found, as with many long series, some books I liked and others I didn't. 

I then came to a short story ""Low men in yellow coats"". 

And oh did it deliver. I finished it and reflected on the series so far (final book still to be read) and found that I enjoyed this short story more than any of the other books in the main series - it had likeable characters who you disliked at certain points, heartbreak, tragedy, suspense, joyful moments that genuinely made me smile or laugh...and an extremely satisfying ending.

This then got me thinking back on series I have read previously. I found in many cases I enjoyed the story in the novellas more than the novels.

Why?

Not sure really. Sometimes it is the feeling that it is setting the stage and certain characters are not going to be in the main series so literally anything can happen to them. The author doesn't need to keep this or that character from real danger, or have them scrap through to continue the story in the next book for the fans/story - no punches pulled. 

Other times it is nice to have a fast paced read where things happen in quick succession or you are shown just a single short event.

Have any of you had a similar experience with a series? 

And why did you find that novella more satisfying than the series? (Avoid spoilers or mentioning characters if possible)

I have the habit of sleeping every other night; it's no doubt terrible for me. My insomnia does allow me to read a fair amount each night, unfortunately my mood tends to fall to the negative especially when the sun comes out.

I am unfortunately cursed with Dyslexia and ADHD, but fortunate my mother paid for tutors specializing in the matter, my reading level was years behind my peers all throughout school. I still read slowly, but feel I make up for that in spending a large amount of time to reading.

**I just finished Leviathan Wakes yesterday**

Which was an easy read that took me to all corners of my imagination -- I struggle to picture sci-f.

**While not reading, doing chores and such, I listen to The Denial of Death.**

Talks philosophy and a little psychiatry, talks much about Fraud himself and his inner-circle. Has made me think about myself and my place in time and space, and death which to some might seem morbid, but the author explain death in a way that will transpire in exploring and employing the discovery of new things and ideas in life. In a way, it explains my love for reading, living in the protagonist, feeling their emotions, this is why I live, sadly but contently excepting of the fact. 

**Questions:**

So if I have to compile a list in the hopes of another reader affluent in knowledge and reading skills, could put me in the right direction for reading more and for longer that would be greatly appreciated:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How can I read faster and have more comprehension while reading books I want to completely comprehend? For example, Anna Karenina or The Iliad.
2. Anyone else share my learning disabilities? and what do you do to curb the symptoms? I have the book Driven to Distraction, but ironically been driven by distraction regarding reading it.
3. I want to be well read, I am 19 and should be in school, but believe me, I am not taking out a loan just for online school, I'm already unorganized, if you could only see my desktop. I want to say I'm taking a sabbatical without pay nor any respect.
4. I have not found what I'm interested in, I was for the longest time interested in computer science, by haven't work on a project or even coded in months. I know I want to work in science, I just don't know where -- partly the reason why I am reading Asimov's Guide to Science, If I read the whole book comprehensively, I feel a general understanding of science will help guide me to where I want to be sub specialized in. Any advice would be very helpful?!
5. Is one of the books I am reading going to confuse the plots of others? I am attempting to read vastly different books in the hopes none of the plots or characters cross over in my mind. Also, is there a genre I am missing that could be included? I wanted to ad The Star Diaries by Stanislaw Lem.
