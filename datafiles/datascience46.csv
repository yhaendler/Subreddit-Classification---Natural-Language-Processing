datascience,"I've been trying for a couple of days to get this package to work properly, without success. I've tried Windows, CentOS, and Ubuntu, and keep running into different issues each time, primarily that it won't use the conda environment I specify, the one that has the packages installed that I need to use. I'm trying to set this up to be usable by a wider team at work, so doing a bunch of janky manual configuration in bash to get a conda environment set up JUST RIGHT, and then editing R config files to point to that conda environment by default is a no-go. Or, if that's the only way it works, I need to create a docker image that gets all that crap out of the way.

One of the blogs I came across (I forget the source) commented on the ""optimistically named"" functions in this package, such as \`use\_conda\_env()\`, which don't actually do what they are intended to. As of right now, there are 276 open issues on the package's GitHub. It's a hot mess.

If anyone has been successful getting this package to work, can you please point me in the right direction? My use case is that we have a custom python ML library that my team uses, and I want to make it easy for the team members who prefer R to be able to use these functions interchangeably with their R code, within RStudio.

Any tips appreciated ... and if I can get it to work, I'll come back here and post a link to the DockerHub image. Thank you in advance!",Anyone have any luck getting RStudio's reticulate package to work?,1597445485

datascience,"Hi all,

I am posting this message on this subreddit hoping to recruit some participants for my study of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

This project researches the communication practices of machine learning (ML) scientists and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers. The goal of this research project is to investigate how data scientists, programmers, and researchers write, talk, and communicate about ML and AI. In particular, I am interested in the detailed practices of practitioners rather than popular marketing-friendly depictions of ML and AI. Your motivations, insights, and strategies would be an incredibly valuable addition to this research project.

**If you are willing to participate in an initial interview, would you be willing to DM me or email me (included at the bottom of this post).** Interviews tend to last about 30-60 minutes and can be conducted by phone or video chat (e.g., zoom). I would need to have you digitally sign a consent form, which I can provide should you decide to participate.

I am happy to answer any questions you have. For more information about me, you can click on the link to my webpage at the bottom of this post. Additionally, I am dedicated, as well as required, to uphold the highest levels of privacy for research participants, especially if you choose to remain anonymous. As an academic researcher, I can offer you no monetary incentive for your participation, but I am happy to share the published results of this work with you when it’s completed.

The principle form of dissemination of the data in this project will be conference presentations, academic journal articles, academic book chapters, and an academic book-length project. Audio and/or video data will not be disseminated, unless participants explicitly agree.

I look forward to hearing from you. I would also appreciate it if you might be willing to forward this message to anyone you know that might be interested in participating in this study.

datascience,"Hey all. I was taking DS at uni but I noticed I needed pretty much super high level math. I’m not super good at math if I’m honest and I capped out pretty much at college algebra. Anyway I was looking into a boot camp which seem great since they offer a job or your money back and added to that I can save the 30k from going to school and only pay 10k for the program. 


My two main issues are I’ve heard they’re pretty math intensive and also fairly difficult. I do have some experience in coding with stuff like Java and C++ so I understand the basic concepts of programming languages but definitely nothing past making a program that can calculate tips and very basic stuff. I also have dabbled with DS online academies so I do understand the very basics of it. I figured I’d ask to people who might know.

datascience,"Hi everyone,

I was wondering if anyone here might be willing to give me some advice. I am a rising sophomore in college interested in law and public policy, and I've realized that I'm fairly unfulfilled by the typical Political Science route, as I think that the value that I — and other humanities majors — provide for our organizations/nonprofits is actually quite limited, even if it's nice to think otherwise. I'm posting here because I'm super lost on the best way to self-study data science. I will be taking a gap year for 2020-2021 and want to spend a lot of my free time dedicating myself to diving into data science. I was curious as to whether people here think I can actually learn enough to be useful on my own? Could I self-study DS everyday for a year and then know enough to maybe provide some value to a think tank, policy research center, etc.? Would I need to also learn a lot of stats or other math, given that the highest math I've taken is just Calc BC from high school? I would consider switching my major to DS after my gap year if I like it as much as I think I will.

I've seen a lot of recommendations for R for Data Science on here, but I've also seen people mention that it doesn't necessarily teach base R. Also, I've seen a lot of conflicting info on whether Python or R is the best one to learn? I would be immensely grateful to anyone that could offer up any advice — maybe if you also switched from humanities to DS, for example — on self-studying, whether that be a certain online class, textbooks, learning communities, or even just thoughts on what (e.g. R vs. Python vs. whatever else) would be the best way to spend my time this year if I'm starting from scratch. I am very willing to pay for resources if they're worth it!

Previously, their stakeholders would lay out a list of things to pull, and what format it should be in, and their role was to deliver those things without performing much analysis. Now that I am looking to them to own the analysis side and think independently about how to uncover insights in the data and what it all means, the process has gone a little more slowly than I expected.

While I am all for coaching others to think analytically rather than being passive data-pullers, I'm also finding it to be a challenging process thus far, where I'm often walking through scenarios like ""if you see X and Y, it means Z"" but not getting a lot of responses when I subsequently ask them to apply this line of thinking to come up with additional observations or scenarios.

I'm working on a personal project to scrape/analyze stock market data with Java. As a disclaimer, I am in college, and I'm doing this project to brush up on some Java concepts that I have learned, and because I enjoy analyzing stock market data. 

Right now I have a simple program that gets the ticker for all publicly traded companies on the NYSE. My program uses the ticker to generate a unique Google Finance URL for each company on the NYSE and right now it just grabs the current price for each stock. 

What I have right now is essentially proof of concept. In the future I want to grab much more data for each company so I can extrapolate more valuable information. 

I'm in the early stages of this project, and I have already identified a significant flaw. My program visits a unique URL for every company on the NYSE and this takes up a ton of time. Is there a good/free website/resource that displays lots of good data for most/all publicly traded companies on a single page or on a single file?

Keep in mind that while I love R dearly, I'm 100% on board with learning Python and get why it's vital to DS. I also think that R is very good at what it does, but I can see how Python would be superior for particular tasks, e.g. ML, and would have more general applicability - so no hate to either language here! 

On the one hand, I've seen/heard folks mention that R is one of the main data science languages and is useful to pick up. It seems commonly advocated for learning/doing data science. On the other hand, from my perusing of job descriptions and from talking to an (admittedly small) sample of data scientists, it has been strongly implied that Python is the industry standard and that a job requiring/focusing on R is more of a rare unicorn. I have seen a few job postings for or with R, but the impression I get is that it's a bonus, whereas Python is a must. I imagine it also depends on the type of data scientist position since an inferential analyst might be more likely to use R than a ML data scientist for instance.

My general takeaway is that while R is useful and can be better for particular things (e.g. tidyverse, more complex/specific statistical models), Python largely satisfies general needs (particularly ML for instance) and many folks can get by just with Python. **So why is R still recommended so much for data science? How much do you actually use R if you also use Python at your job?** I realize things are fast paced and have changed a lot over the years so I'm not sure if the advice I've seen regarding R is antiquated or more specific to data analyst jobs (though SAS seems more common for those tbh).
