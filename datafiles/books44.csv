I believe written in the mid-70's.  A tale of a tortured man refusing to believe in the world he's been thrust into.  A great tale of redemption and hope.

books,"This is the first book I've ever read and thought ""this truly is a golden nugget."" People will have their opinions on Charles Bukowski but one thing we must all agree on is that he's damn fine with dialogue. From what I heard this book is more or less a loose fictional/nonfictional autobiography of his life, and what a story it is, I've never had such a fine time listening about kids doing every day things. He's not afraid to get dirty, he's not afraid to tell you something, and he definitely speaks his mind, something I think we lack a lot of today, people tiptoeing around conversations like they were landmines. Though its a fairly humorous book I don't think it's meant to be taken that way, he seems to have lived through a lot of hardships, mostly involving his abusive father, though he talks like that one weird uncle of yours that shows up at family gatherings so you can't help but not take him seriously. I even gave the audio book a listen and I'm not sure if its the author himself reading but I love that he sounds like he's completely sloshed while recording audio. Overall he's not perfect, he's a grumpy man with strong opinions, but I can't help but love him for it. I'm not sure if this is a popular book or author, but I thought I'd give my thoughts on this book and suggest it to anyone who hasn't read it. I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes from the book.

books,"Just finished Steinbeck's *East of Eden* thanks to this sub's obsession with what I could easily place among the top three books I've ever read. I stumbled across this quote early on in the novel and was in awe of how accurately Steinbeck describes my precise feelings on the perceived nothingness of quarantine. We always hear that ""time flies when we're having fun,"" so why is that we perceive such eventless times so counterintuitively to this maxim? As Steinbeck so adroitly puts it:

 “Time interval is a strange and contradictory matter in the mind. It would be reasonable to suppose that a routine time or an eventless time would seem interminable. It should be so, but it is not. It is the dull eventless times that have no duration whatever. A time splashed with interest, wounded with tragedy, crevassed with joy - that's the time that seems long in the memory. And this is right when you think about it. Eventlessness has no posts to drape duration on. From nothing to nothing is no time at all.”

This is by far my favorite quote from this novel--even topping:

books,"Setting up displays for new books, mostly oversized artbooks (12-15"" tall). Right now I'm using one pair of heavy duty bookstands to sandwich about 40 books together (approx. 4-5 feet worth of books)

They all somewhat rely on each other to stand up straight. I know that ideally I would want to lay them flat, but due to the number (40 is just one shelf) it's not possible. 

Is there any benefit to adding MORE bookstands to this row? Such as every 10-15 books (every 18-24 inches or so?) Or is that just unnecessary?

books,"This is one of the reasons I can't use the library, I'm just too goddamn destructive with books. Over quarantine I've rekindled my love of reading, and I've noticed that the same entropic fate has befallen each copy.

A few weeks ago, I accidentally dropped my copy of Frederick Douglas's narrative into the creek where I read it. When I finally dried it off, the pages were coarse and waterlogged, and while it upset me at first, I soon realized it almost added something to those misery filled passages where he poured out his soul. Those ruined pages seemed to be stained with the tears of a brilliant man doomed to slavery. Suddenly, this pristine edition appeared much more appropriate to the story it was trying to tell. It felt raw and fractured, but still salvageable and beautiful, just like its author. Soon enough, I began to put myself into the shoes of Douglas himself. Reading it became an act of determination, as I strained my eyes to make out smudged words. For Douglas, a man who traded bread with urchins and studied letters painted on ship pieces to learn how to read, this certainly would have been nothing. 

So when I finished it, I found myself with something that felt incredibly intimate. It was like a signature Douglas made 140 years after his death. And every time I look at it, I'll remember the creekside convention in Pendleton, Indiana where he signed it. 

I could go on this way about every book I've ever completed. Whether it's the coffee stains from a sleepy afternoon or the spaghetti sauce of a meal eaten over a story I just couldn't tear myself away from, the markings of my books are like a visual diary. They tell me what I was thinking, the places I brought it, where I stopped and started, express my frustration and my delight.

books,"Before we start, i am subjective. i have been reading Atonement by Ian Mcewan. Book is 603 pages, currently i am on 433, which is the end of second part. ( i am saying this because i don't know if it's same in different editions). Anyway, what was that whole second part ? i almost skipped several pages, but then i was just encouraging myself that it might have been part of the plot and it was necessary but oh boy. First part was decent, intriguing, thrilling, second part started well too. turner and corporals . typical days of WW2. But as i was reading, gradually realized that it was one of the most boring books i have ever read. These details were so unnecessary. i didn't really get what was the purpose of it? i just read it and i can tell i don't even remember a thing about this whole war journey except him getting wounded, meeting with 2 french families and thoughts about cecille . and it's funny because this journey took almost 200 pages. and these 200 pages were the boring ones. i am really hoping that last part will be great. because as i have read some reviews in goodreads, people say that even though start is dull, it is getting better and better and i really want the ending to be worth. 

P.S i am not really hating on this book. just my opinion, i like big books, but in this scenario and plot, that whole war journey was so unnecessary, maybe some words, maybe little bit of description, but not this one hell of a ww2 history in a novel, where in a first part, i practically associated myself and my thoughts with a little girl.",Atonement by Ian Mcewan being utterly praised is little bit questionable for me.,1596564544
books,"Wow. Just wow. I've grown up watching the movies because my dad is a HUGE Tolkien nerd (translated Sindarin on his own lol). He read me The Hobbit when I was little, and I read the Silmarillion a while back on his recommendation. But until now, I'd never read the actual trilogy because I thought the movies were good enough.

I was so, so wrong. I finished the last chapter at 2am last night after a 6 month journey through the amazing world that Tolkien has crafted. In that time, the world has fallen apart, I was broken up with, left college, and I've been searching for where I want my life to go from here. Perhaps it's the fact that my own journey has been so hard during this time that the books hit me with such enormous emotional power, but I feel as though the world has been changed. Last night, as I said goodbye to the characters and world, I found myself crying. So much of their journey has been my own in these last 6 months, and I could never describe the joy and sorrow I felt as I turned those last pages.

There is an element of safety in fantasy, since you know it isn't real. But for me, the journey has not quite ended, and it is real. This trilogy has given me faith in a happy end, however. And I can thank Master Samwise for that. ""It’s like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn’t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come.

By page 100 i would quit reading if wasn't for his behind scene accounts of oil tycoons and small celebrity figures abused by media.

TL:DR: the book was way to long for the point it was trying so hamfist in. I liked the author's other works, but reading this felt like watching an Amazing Atheist video, which isnt my thing, but it could be other people's thing.",Upton Sinclair's Brass Check,1596557269

* How many pages you read during the year
* The longest and shortest book you read
* The highest rated book you read
* The most and least popular book you read

I really enjoyed using that page as a summary of my reading for the year, but now I can't seem to find it. Does anyone know how to access it?","Does anyone know where Goodreads' ""Your 2020 Books"" page went?",1596554895
