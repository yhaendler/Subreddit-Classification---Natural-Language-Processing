books,"And it's not because I'm a slow reader - quite the contrary. But this was a book worth taking my time over.

I think it's mostly to do with the fact that I knew beforehand how the story of this remarkable ship ends, and I was putting off reading about the details.

Couple this with the wonderful and charming way in which Palin (of Monty Python fame) relayed the history of this ship (and its sister ship, *Terror*) from its birth in Pembroke Dock, to its expeditions at both ends of the world in the Royal Navy's golden age of polar exploration, and finally to its end (the details of which I'll leave out). I just didn't want the book to end. 

I highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in books about exploration and old ships. I'm glad it's my last read of 2019.

And after you've read this and learned of *HMS Erebus* and the Franklin expedition, may I suggest *Terror* by Dan Simmons for a fictional follow on.

Worst Book: *Thunderhead*  \- I enjoyed the first book of the series, *Scythe*, and decided to check out the sequel. *Thunderhead* was an exciting read, but the main conclusion I took away from it was that *Scythe* should've stayed a stand-alone book. (Runner-ups: *Duel at Araluen;* *Rich People Problems*)Best Book: *The White Album* \- This was a tough call, but this was ultimately my favorite book I read this year. All the essays felt both of its time and timeless at the same time. Plus, the title essay is worth the price of admission alone.

books,"I set a personal goal to read a series of books from a college course I never got to take (the professor's sabbatical unfortunately coincided with my senior year). I just finished *Middlemarch*, and loved it, but I am HATING *Jane Eyre*. The world building is so gratingly adolescent, everything from the characterization of the Reeds to her perspective of Mr. Rochester. (OK: we can argue that ""that's the point because Jane is young and it's from her POV""--but that doesn't make it a pleasant read for me).  

In general, I put down a boring book. When it's a ""classic,"" it becomes more complicated for me. It reminded me of this thread, where someone asked if [they should read the classics](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5pvmwv/should_i_read_classics_even_if_i_dont_enjoy_them/) even if they don't enjoy them. One user suggested that you might read for ""self-betterment,"" or well-roundedness, if you really take reading seriously as a practice. 

I've been thinking a lot about this concept because although it's a standard I unconsciously abide by, when we discipline ourselves to read for self-betterment, it implies there is something inherently bettering about ""classics"" in a canon curated along lines of both privilege and chance. It's not that I won't read something challenging or dull (I have), but *Jane Eyre* is really stumping me as falling into the ""self-betterment"" category because a lot of the ideas encapsulated in the storyline are actually [really racist](https://lithub.com/reading-jane-eyre-while-black/), and frankly, I find the overall feminist moral arch of the story outdated. So it's hard for me to categorize this pleasureless read as ""self-betterment"" in any moral, philosophical, or spiritual way. 

One book won't make or break me as a reader or a person. But I'm interested in other people's take on what it means to read for self-betterment. Is that moral betterment? Cultural betterment? Do you read to write better? And should I finish *Jane Eyre*?","Should I finish reading Jane Eyre? Do you read for ""self-betterment?""",1577830596

books,"Once an avid reader, I like many found myself prone to scrolling through my phone or getting caught up in TV series, never bothering to make time to read. I decided that would change in 2019 and challenged myself to read 30 books this year. Not very far into 2019 and a few 500+ paged books later, I realized the win was not in how many books I could read this year, but the journey on which these books would carry me and the strength and comfort they’d provide. 

This year was filled with major highs and lows. I cared for a dying parent, got engaged to an amazing partner, received a big promotion at work, and unfortunately buried my mother today on New Years Eve (one month before my wedding). 

Reading “When breath becomes air” by Paul Kalanithi 3 weeks before my mom passed provided me much needed insight and helped me process the inevitable. Reading “Educated” by Tara Westover allowed me to enter 2019 with curiosity for learning new things and continuing to open my eyes to new people and experiences. Reading “A Game of Thrones” provided me much needed escapism. “The Great Believers” by Rebecca Makkai was the best book I read this year followed by “The Leavers” by Lisa Ko. Both these books helped me process loss and courage through a fictional lens. Ending the year on “She Said” by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey makes me excited for the year to come and the growing power of marginalized voices as we fight for justice.

books,"I love a good thriller or mystery so I was so excited to read this book but I was left throughly disappointed. Around the halfway point of the book I mostly guessed what the twist was going to be and when it came it was a huge let down. The more I reflect back on the book, the more disappointef I become. I know this was one of the highest rated books of the year and that is really making me question my opinions on it. 

Some of the reasons I didn't like the book were that I felt the two main characters, especially Theo were weak and allowed people in their lives to trample all over them, not especially a great quality for a psychotherapist. They both created these god like figures for their spouses and seemed to not be interested in anything but them.  I feel like the author put in a lot of things in the story that didn't seem to come to fruition or seemed they were just were put in to try and throw you off.  

There were a few other things that bothered me in the story and since I took notes while reading (I like to incase I need to recall something) I can see the progression of my dissppointment. Usually can't put a book down once I start it, and I took a lot of breaks in between this one. Maybe I'm being to harsh or I set my expectations to high?

books,"No spoilers.
You know those books that seem like they’re one of the best you’ve read after you finish them? The books that have you thinking about them for days afterward? This one definitely checks those boxes. So much so that I needed to write this afterward.

Readability:

Not very long. About 300 pages, finished in 4-5 hours. Extremely gripping and definitely rereadable. Once I started this book, I could not put it down.

Writing Style:

Narrated as journal entries, chronological order. Usually in first person. A quirk in the narration is when the protagonist recalls himself as a child, it abrubtly switches to third person and the protagonist refers to himself by his full name (almost as another person with their own separate attributes, experience and personality.)

The language, however is simple and easy to read. It is not overly embellished, or as my dad says, 'flowery'. Unlike other classic books, not too many words are spent on description or setting (except for one or two instances that I can recall, such as a sex scene towards the end- this is a contrast to the books I typically read).

Not much incorporation of scientific explanation in the book. Although a major aspect of the plot had to do with the scientific method, experiments, research, IQ, publications, etc., it was brushed off and not given any explanation at all. For instance, when a discovery was being talked about, they were just explained like,""This was a new discovery involving whatever that would change humanity forever."" It was very surface level. I however, did not mind at all. Although scientific explanations and lingo are thoroughly enjoyed by me, it was not neccessary to the book, and would serve as an 'extra' rather than increasing the value/depth of the book itself.

Depth:
A very interesting aspect about description of events in this book is that they indicate the state of mind of the narrator. In this case, the clarity of thoughts and ability to comprehend and understand the depth behind events. Description of events goes from shallow and surface-level to deep and emotional (at which point truths about life and the human condition are talked about by the narrator). So this doubles as a character development technique, by playing with the way the character sees things.


Characters/Plot:

Like all good books,no matter how many negative qualities a character posessed, they were relatable, multi dimensional, and realistic, if not likeable.

The story itself was deceptively simple, but extremely well written. It was less of a story, and more of an experience/ inner workings of our protagonist’s mind, which is where it gets it's richness from.

Closure:

The ending was heartbreakingly realistic, which made it very satisfying. It was an ending well deserved by this book. 

Nothing was revealed as 'aftermath' or explanation for the ending. The ending was abrupt and jarring, making the book chronologically asymmetrical. However (surprisingly), this was welcome, as any good book demands some analysis, extrapolation and contemplation about the nature of human existence.

books,"I’ve been a huge Agatha Christie fan for years, as soon as I was able to reach that bookshelf in my local library. My library was somewhat limited but had about 20 of her books that I read over and over. Recently I came across a huge amount of Ms Christie’s books on Archive dot org. 
I’ve finally had a chance to read one of her most famous novels, Roger Ackroyd. 
I’m speechless. 

(Spoilers:)

The shocking reveal of an unreliable narrator triggered a realization in my own mind: I’ve allowed my own unreliable narrator to dictate and control my thoughts, professing, emotions, etc...particularly when I look back on past experiences. 
I was in a very difficult place, emotionally, and lamenting some major life decisions. Over and over, I would draw on the ‘fact’ that I was so much happier before I made said decisions and how I wished I could go back to that. 
It was like a light came on in my brain when I suddenly wondered: “but what if that’s been an unreliable narrator speaking to me this whole time?” And suddenly, I was able to see that no indeed, I had not been happy before that decision I made. In fact, I was so miserable, I pushed myself into many poor decisions to try to find contentment and purpose. 
The glass shattered when I saw how much that narrator had convinced me to sink into misery everyday, bemoaning my past, when in fact, that just wasn’t how things were. 
Of course it didn’t magically fix my current situation, but I realized that I wasn’t as trapped as I thought I had been. Taking a step back and seeing what really happened, not just what my mind wants to remember, has been an important step to my mental health regarding my circumstances. 

I hope this made some sense and I’m so grateful this message came across through one of my favorite authors.",The Murder of Roger Ackroyd made a major impact on my life,1577816183

Be warned: There is some light reading included, such as Wimpy Kid. It was difficult for me to keep my attention long enough to read more than a page at first, so I started out with that. Other than that, I am GREATLY interested in the field of Children’s Literature, so there’s a lot of that as well.

‘Grown-up’ books:

1. **One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez**: I LOVED IT. MY FAVOURITE BOOK THAT I READ THIS YEAR. It was the first time that I read a book written in the style of magical realism. I loved the cyclical style of the book (writing vaguely because I don’t want to spoil anything). It ties in to my own ideas of life. Other than that, I enjoyed the story as a whole.

2. **The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde**: THIS IS ALSO MY FAVOURITE BOOK. I love this book. Every sentence is a pure work of art. I’m a huge fan of Wilde’s writing style, and his wit. I don’t have a good memory, especially when it comes to quotes, but there are so many lines that are etched onto my brain. At one point, Henry tells Dorian to “always be open to new experiences”. This isn’t one of the more popular lines of the book, but I’ve tried to make it my motto. I’m in college, and I tend to pass on a lot of events and opportunities because I’m shy and prefer staying at home. This line really spoke to me. I also loved it when the same character told someone that the best way to stay young is to keep doing things you regret, lol. 

3. **Lady Windermere’s Fan by Oscar Wilde**: This is a play. Honestly, I think every Wilde play I read will now have to measure up to **Importance of being Earnest**, a difficult task. But I still loved the play. I examined it for a paper I wrote, and the question of who is truly the ‘good woman’ of the subtitle is one that intrigues me.

4. **Totto Chan by Tetsuko Kuroyanagi**: The author is famous Japanese actress. The book is biographical, telling the story of her life as a child in war era Japan. She attends a Montessori style school, a school that is located within a refurbished old train. I loved it. I liked the quaint writing, and the setting of the book. War is not at the forefront, but it shows how it affects the lives of the ordinary citizens including schoolchildren. I think it treads the line of being a book aimed at children, but it wasn’t marketed as such.

5. **Silence! The Court is in Session by Vijay Tendulkar**: Amazing. I can’t do justice to it due to limited time, but it was so well written. This is a Marathi play, written in 1967. I loved the character of Leela Benare, and the progression and end of the play. It’s a short play, I DEFINITELY recommend it.

6. **Love and Devotion by Erica James**: A friend found this at a flea market and lent it to me. I was doing a lot of heavy reading at that time, and I wanted something simple. I expected it to be like other airplane books, but it was surprisingly good. The writing was a little patchy and just bad in some places, and the dialogue felt unnatural at times. But I think the plot made up for it. I enjoyed it, but wouldn’t really recommend it.

7. **Surprise Party by Sue Welfare**: Another flea market find by the same friend. I didn’t find it very good or remarkable in any way.

8. **As you like it by William Shakespeare**: I don’t have any great insights, other than I enjoyed it and love Shakespeare. Once again, I’ll needlessly bring up that I examined it for a paper, lol. I was amazed at how deep and intricate the idea of gender (and sexuality) is in this play. This is still something greatly debated in our society. In addition, everyone probably knows this, but I LOVED how he tied in the traditions and festivities of Twelfth Night with the personalities of the characters and the plot of the play.

9. **Iliad by Homer**: This is one where I really cannot put into a few sentences what I felt. War is ever present, customary of writing of Homer’s culture and time period. However, I find Homer’s portrayal of war to be unique. War was glorified to the people of his time, and this is reflected in their literature as well. I think Homer may have suggested in the Iliad a few times that war was truly futile, and I think it’s worth a read, even if you only read the abridged version. 

10. **Like a Willow Tree by Rei Kimura**: Such an interesting read. I was never aware of the camps set up for the Japanese in America. In literature, there is an idea of history with a small ’h’ that I learned about recently. It is about how history focuses on the lives of great, extraordinary and famous people, and the lives of normal people affected by historical events is untouched. I believe this book does well in its depiction of an otherwise normal family being turned upside down due to the war; something I felt in Totto Chan as well. I enjoyed it, would recommend, especially if that part of history interests you.

11. **Nip the Buds, Shoot the** **Kids by Kenzaburo Oe**: LOVED. I love books where children are depicted as the opposite of innocent and pure, such as **Lord of the Flies by William Golding** and **Three Quarters of an Orange by Joanne Harris**. If anyone has any recommendations of such books, please tell me!

12. **The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath**: I loved it. I loved the famous line about the fig tree, but there are so many other lines that touched me. At one point, she writes about how even though the bell jar is temporarily lifted, she never knows when it will enclose her again. I found that especially poignant and sad with how it ties into her own life, of overcoming depression only to succumb to it later.

13. **In the Unlikely Even by Judy Blume**: I really enjoyed it. I’m getting tired of typing so not many great insights, but one is that I love it when she writes book in that time period. Combine literature with accurate history and we stan.

14. **Wifey by Judy Blume**: LOVED. Very well written. In the author’s introduction, she writes about how this was her first adult book, and where it came from. Can you tell by now that I love Judy? She wrote about so many topics that would have been considered taboo at that time, something she got a lot of flak for. This is book about a housewife who feels there must be more to life than caring for her family and performing her womanly duties. She has a series of affairs (very well written sex scenes). I’m very forgiving of cheaters when Judy writes them, lol

15. **A Confederacy of Dunces by John K Toole**:  Another favourite of this year. I found out about this book thanks to reddit. Strongly recommend reading it.

16. **The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald:** I loved this as well. Loved it so much. The message, plot, writing style, everything. I had read it earlier when I was 13, but I hadn’t liked it or understood it. Besides, I had forgotten almost all of it, so I’m counting it as a new read this year. My apologies for not going into detail about it, but it’s wonderful.

17. **Liza of Lambeth by W Somerset Maugham:** Prior to this, I’d only read **Princess September** by Maugham (which is on my list of best short stories). The book wasn’t amazing, but still good, in my opinion. I enjoyed it, would recommend.

18. **Summer Sisters by Judy Blume:** I liked it. I didn’t like it as much as **Wifey**, but it was still nice.

19. **Smart Women by Judy Blume:** I really loved it! Once again, I’d recommend reading her introduction to the novel**.** Both the parents and the parents have their stories so well told, even though they may be against each other, their point of view is well told enough for their actions to be justified… most of the time. 

Children’s books:

1. **Diary of a Wimpy Kid- The Getaway by Jeff Kinney**: The first book I read this year. Don’t remember much of it other than that I enjoyed it.

2. **Here’s to you, Rachel Robinson by Judy Blume**: Judy Blume is in my top 3 of Children’s writers. It’s hard for me to explain what it is I like, but I’ll try. They’re a real slice of life, I think. What happens to the characters is believable; they’re normal people like the readers. Her style of storytelling, according to me, is different from what people generally think books are. It’s not a clear cut 7 step plot, no clear demarcation of beginning, conflict, end. Conflicts of varying degrees occur throughout the book, much like real life. I’m not happy with the way I’ve explained that, but I hope you get what I mean. Anyway, I enjoyed the book. I enjoyed Rachel’s character, it’s rare to see someone like her be the protagonist of a book, especially a children’s book. She was well fleshed out, so was her entire family. Though the story is told in her POV, you still see the stories of other character relayed well, with each of their actions being justified, no good vs. bad situation that a lot of children’s lit has.

3. **Just as long as we’re together by Judy Blume**: This is set in the same universe as Rachel Robinson, and the events take place earlier. It was published first (and I think I read it first as well, just messed up my order of noting it down). Again, a well written book.

4. **My mum, Tracy Beaker by Jacqueline Wilson**: I read the Tracy Beaker books a long time ago, but I know that she is one of Wilson’s most beloved characters. Many times when an author writes about one of their popular child characters as grown-ups, it is neither well done nor well received. I don’t know about the reception, but it was definitely well done. It didn’t feel like character assassination or out of place in any way. I liked it.

5. **Room of Many Colours by Ruskin Bond**: This is a collection of stories; I think it had like 30 stories in it?  I love Ruskin Bond, and I loved the collection. I read this book while I was in Uttrakhand, the setting of his stories, and reading it was such a lovely experience. So many great stories: **Panther’s Moon** was the best in my opinion. The saga of **Uncle Ken** was so enjoyable to read, I wish there was more of him. I also loved the **Room of Many Colours** and **The Prospect of Flowers**. Side note, I met Ruskin Bond this year and he signed my books &lt;3

6. **Midnight by Jacqueline Wilson**: Wilson is also in my top 3 of Children’s writers. This is a slightly dark book, one that I felt was a bit misunderstood by online reviewers. After all, it’s in Wilson’s style to write about themes that are otherwise rarely seen in children’s fiction, such as death, sexuality, mental illnesses like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, etc. Not one her best books, but I really liked it.

7. **Deenie by Judy Blume**: I’d wanted to rad his since I was a kid, and finally found it this year. My memory of it is vague because I read it early in the year, but I liked it. I liked the elder sister pointing out how ridiculous it is to separate the concepts of beauty and brain, as though they cannot exist together. I think that’s an important idea to relay to children. Also, it was interesting to see a character with scoliosis in a children’s book.

8. **The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams**: How had I never read this before??? I LOVE IT. A true classic children’s book. The idea of becoming Real because you are loved…I cri. I know it’s weird, but it was so comforting to me (and I imagine it would be to other children as well). I grew up with Enid Blyton as my bread and butter, and the idea of toys coming to life and having emotions was ingrained in me since before I can remember. If you don’t give enough time to a toy while playing, or lose it, or just become detached, that idea can give a sense of guilt at times. I definitely had that and I still do have it, when I look at my toys who meant so much to me but are now inanimate objects cast aside. But the thought that because of my love, they were made Real (and maybe their souls are off happily existing somewhere in the world) means so much to weird person like me hehe.

9. **Candy Floss by Jacqueline Wilson**: Really liked it, as is my experience with all of Wilson’s books. Nothing else to say except that I love Jacqueline Wilson.

10. **Diary of a Wimpy Kid-Wrecking Ball by Jeff Kinney**: I found the beginning slightly long drawn. It wasn’t as good as the others in the series.

11. **Rent-a-Bridesmaid by Jacqueline Wilson**: The concept and execution of this book is so CUTE! It was very enjoyable.

12. **Dancing The Charleston by Jacqueline Wilson:**  I LOVED IT SO MUCH, I was honestly surprised at how much I loved it. My only complaint was that it ended too soon, I want to read more! I loved the character of the uncle, I really wish he could have his own book, but that won’t happen. Along with Judy Blume, I really love Jacqueline Wilson’s historical fiction too. My favourite book from the **World of Hetty Feather** was **Rose Rivers**, but I think now it’s a tie along with this one. 

Non-Fiction:

1. **When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi**: Paul was a neurosurgeon who died due to lung cancer. This book is a HARD recommend. Amazingly written. I read it as a way to try to understand the meaning and purpose of life, after being introduced to it by my Psych professor. Firstly, as literature student who was at one point studying together to become a doctor, I feel like I saw my spirit reflected in him in the first part of the book. Like my bosom friend. His writing on the subjects of literature and medicine, and how they connect in understanding life meant so much to me. When he is diagnosed, he doesn’t know if he will die in next 10 months or the next 10 years. About this, he writes something like “I was always aware of my death, now I was made aware of it more acutely”. I was deeply touched by this. When I wonder how someone’s life or philosophy may have changed due to a terminal illness, I remember this line.

2. **Born Again on the Mountain by Arunima Sinha**: A great read. It’s remarkable how she overcame so much. I found the other anecdotes and details about mountain climbing, (especially the Everest) to be very interesting.

3. **Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl**: This was again recommended to me by my Psychology professor. Frankl was a holocaust survivor, as well as a psychiatrist and neurologist. I loved it. I didn’t do justice to the latter part of the book, where he focuses mainly on psychological theories. I’ll need to reread that when I am in the right temperament.

4. **A Child Called It by Dave Pelzer**: I read about this on reddit. I was so deeply invested in the book, it really hurt when I read the accounts of so many people who believe the book was fabricated or exaggerated. I don’t know what to believe, so I don’t know what to say.

5. **The Lost Boy by Dave Pelzer**: Sequel to the above. Again, I don’t have much to say.

Some poems I read, off the top of my head:

I didn’t make a list of all the poems I read this year, but these are some that I enjoyed

1. **The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T S Elliot**: I loved this so much it made me cry. So beautifully written. This is my favourite poem.

2. **The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe**: I read this before, but I felt it so deeply when I read it again this year.

3. **The Lady's Dressing Room by Jonathan Swift**: I came across this poem on r/skincareaddiction lol. It was hilarious, I enjoyed it a lot.

4. **Thomas and Beulah by Rita Dove**: I didn’t expect to love these poems as much as I did. Rita Dove speaks a lot about history with a small ‘h’, I learned of this concept through her. There is a video on YouTube where she reads and explains some of the poems; you can watch that if you are interested.

I’m trying to get into poetry, what is a poem you really like?

I also read an anthology of post colonialism this year, which had around 20 stories. I don’t remember the name of the collection, but post colonialism really interests me. Does anyone have any recommendations of such writing?

My friend who is an English teacher started teaching in a small school in an area where most kids don’t have access (mostly finances) to books. Previous teacher took all the books that had been donated/bought with her when she left. So she is building up the small library from nothing that would be available for all the kids (high school). Me and my friends along with herself have been buying and getting books but obviously it gets pricey so I have set up an amazon wish list that I was going to share with a bigger group of friends or in book lovers groups. She has no idea I have set this up and I’m hoping we can get a good number of books to surprise her. 
Anyways, could you please look over and suggest books that should be on this list that are a must read? Or let me know if something shouldn’t be on the list? 
My kids are in elementary school so I have been browsing different lists to put this together. 

And if somebody would like to buy off the list that would be awesome too!

I used to read Sherlock Holmes and enjoyed it A LOT. But when I realized that there are only ~50 short stories in the series, I took them *too* seriously. I enjoyed them less because I wanted to get and understand everything out of something I won’t be able to experience anymore. I had to drop Sherlock Holmes for months now.
This also happened to The Handmaid’s Tale. It was praised by everyone. So when I picked it up, of course, I wanted to get everything out of it. It sucks and I can’t help it.

  Passages complained of in Goog/e ßfe - *No* *Lies*  1.  Thirty minutes later Gareth\*s eldest son Joel erred u F at the restaurant and sat next to me. A very tall, but handsome young man, who seemed  to have his head on his shoulders, which was quite impressive, given that he had been surrounded with so much wealth and privilege. The interactions I etween Gareth and his son were interesting. Both seemed very calm arid very deep. His son said that he would like to become a teacher, how satisfying and rewarding to watch people grow and achieve I told them.  2.   
   As I turned to look at him, he reached down towards me and began to stroke my hair, gently turning my face towards his lie began to firmly kiss me on the lips. I didn’t resist by now I was settled in my mind, yes I like this man, we load a connection.   
   Before I knew it his hands were inside my blouse tugging furiously at my bra I said ”no, no, don't do that” he asked me what was the matter I replied ”I don't have any confidence with you, I have only just met you"" he stopped touching me for a few minutes  and  we  laid on  the bed talking, before tae started the kissing again, slowly my resolve was waning to the temptation of lbs charms,  he  was  very  determined  and not giving up lie wanted what he wanted!!  3.   
   Gareth told me it was a similar situation for him no sex for months.  It was ""The Perfect Storm"". Somehow my knickers together with the tight blac-k leather trousers that I said to myself were never coming off, were being ripped to my ankles, one after the other my boots hit the floor. He whisperec4 in my ear Donna ""are you sure about this"" ha, lia I bet he wished he hadn't asked that question because all my doubts came rushing back "" aw..uh I dont no"" but it was too late for second thoughts  we will already making love.   
   The experience was not what I was expecting, there was something rather juvenile about the way he handled me and I felt the need to take over. Pushing his off of me and climbing on top, I said to him ""I am the boss now"" he stopped and went completely submissive ""yes you’re the boss"". He comes across as a powerful and controlling man, but lo1 not that night!!   
   The next morning I woke up in Gareth Bulls bed, feeling all sorts of emotions!! How could I have let that haPpen, it was too SoOT1, I should have tween stronger!! As we tooth opened our eyes he kissed me  affectionately on the cheek and said “you’re the first girl I leave slept with since meeting my wife and that was wonderful, you have put a big snule on my face, ""

   hand was 	ecstatic with himself.   
   he 	on the other  

   I 	quickly got dressed , and said that I needed to go he said ""that's 	a shame"" looking at the bulge in his pants I think he was up 	for more but sober me couldn't wait to get to the door ""see you 	later"" I said ""come down to the bar and have a drink with 	me"". ""I will, and don’t worry about anything it’s been 	great"" he said.   
   5. 

After a few drinks ance no desserts we retired back to Gareth's villa and cuddled up in bed talking all night long, putting the world  to rights before tooth drifting off  to sleep. No sex, it wasn’t important we were just happy, relaxed and satisfied  in each other’s company.   
    
   The following morning it was an early start to take Gareth back to the airport. As I sat on the sofa waiting for him to finish his shower, it was  £1S lf we had known each other for years. The atmosphere in the villa was warm and sensual. I stretched out on the sofa lying on my tummy I closed my eyes and a few minutes  later I felt his hand stroking my bottom he said ""you really are gorgeous, and you have made me really happy."" we kissed and cuddle for a few minutes I efore he made final checks and locked the door.   
    
    
   When we walked through the door the talking stopped, and the kissing started, he started to gently stroke my bottom,  we dropped onto the bed and it was straight down to it.   
  7.   
   This time he didn't need  to be told who  was in charge he  was completely submissive, just the way I wanted him. After all he had too much money and power in the real world, for once he was not going to be in control I was. This girl was definitely going to be on top ha ha, and he had no complaints in fact he loved it.  We both slept soundly  that  night  and woke up  in a reflective  mood."" You alright baby ” he said, I smiled and replied ""yes all good"", I then suddenly became really conscious about the way I looked, I grabbed a robe and headed for the bathroom, hunting for my makeup bag and mouthwash, ""found it” I thought thank goodness for that, then a quick brush of the hair. A few minutes later he strolled into the bathroom completely  starker’s,  really  confident,   and  there   was  me  covering myself up feeling really self-conscious. He  grabbed his  toothbrush  and his mouthwash, it was the same  as mine,  we joked  about  it,  “Great minds must think alike”. Then he said ”What are we doing then Donna? Heading back to bed or jumping in the shower and having breakfast?” I looked at him and said ""Babe I am not a morning person,  I'm definitely not getting up yet”. So we both snuck back to bed and cuddled up. He pulled me tight to him,  placing  my  head  under  his  arm.  I  felt  really warm, comfortable and safe and we started to talk about life.   
   8.   
   He retorted “we're not together”, he insisted ”she's at home with the joys today but she wants to go to Tenerife so I may have to leave earlier than expected to get back for the boys"".   
   9.   
   With that in mind I asked him “did she leave this trip planned for long or was it a sudden decision?”, “it was a very sudden decision"" he said ""she just text me a few hours ago look"" he said showing me the message. This just confirmed my suspicions; I logically thought were they really truly separated?   
   Questioning him gently, I said “So tell me what happened with you and Catherine? it sounds like she really hurt you"" Gareth went on to  describe how they had seFarated twice and how devastated this had been for him, Wlth his world falling **apart,** adding that he was not  waiting around for her to do it to him a third time; he was getting on with his life. He laad moved in with his father-in-law to start off with but now hac4 his own place.  10.   
   ""Doruaa, things haven’t tween right  for a long time"" he replied ""since we have fallen out of love with each other everything has become a problem, “ he then proceeded to explain to me how he and Catherine had  taken over  the local football  club which was about to go out of business they had renovated the grounds and Clubhouse, he had taken charge of the football team and she had taken charge of the administration.   
   He recited to me various stories of how they had argued over what seemed to me to be relatively straightforward issues. I listened with both interest and amusement. It seemed crazy to think that they had allowed what was on the face of it, to be lots of minor issues to become the source of so much anger and resentment. It oily served to show how distant they had become from one another. He c4escribed situations of distinct coldness between them.   
  11.   
   I asked him how his children were coping with the situation. He felt they had handled the situation well   
  12.   
    
   ""Come here"" he said pulling away the white duvet rolling on top of me "" be quiet"" he whisper ""we  have  unfinished  business"",  slowly  he  stripped me bare, ""these are nice knickers"" ( they  were the new ones from  Marks &amp; Spencers, definitely worth buying then I thought), he pulled them down to my ankles and then went for my bra, but it was morning and really light and bright, the sky blue curtains we partially open, and suddenly I again felt so self conscience.  My breasts were pert but lacking volume since the birth of my five children. ""No, no Gareth I want to keep it on "" he chuckled and said “now, now Donna you are not a shy  person""  ""well I  am right now"" I said ""but you’re always so confident"" he said before pushing aside my little black bra and biting my nipples. He was definitely in charge this morning and was being very affectionate, much more so than the night the night before. We had definitely grown closer to each other. It was clear that there was a very strong sexual attraction (between us. He kissed me all over and then slowly but surely he began to make love to me, lie was growing in his coifiidence and really trying to please me.   
   Afterwards he kissed me on cheek and cuddle  me saying,  ""I really enjoyed you"" I didn't reply, lout really felt  like asking Uni  ""why  didn’t you enjoy your wife? What went wrong in that department *beca*u*se* it’s clear something did"" Sex with Gareth was okay, lout it was clear  to me that he had a lot to learn! his performance was  what  I  would  term  "" once a month martial sex"" going through motions lacking in variety and adventure, although passionate and  trying  to impress  me ,  god  bless him what’s that saying "" everybody  loves a  trier"".  We are going  to have to work on this I smiled to myself.

   thought you and Cath were separated.  Ho( e you're not lying to me."" ""Donna, I'm r’tot. Really, I'm not. It's just no one knows I'm here. It's still a secret frorrt most people but I'll sort it out.""  14.   
   I can remember very clearly what I was wearing that night. I had bought a new little mini dress and matching coloured underwear. Pinafore style. Gareth pulled me in from the balcony, the wine  glass still in my hand. He pu.shed back the hair from my face and began kissing me passionately on the lips. “You look great in this little dress” he said. “Keep it on.” I suppose if I’m honest, the dress was a little bit short, with a floaty skirt.   
   There was something about the black smoky mirrors and the lighting that made the room feel sensual. He led me towards the bed, whispering in my ear “you look absolutely amazing, and you’ve got such a fantastic bum”. Tonight he was being really masterful. Pushing me face down on to the bed, dropping his shorts right in front of the black smoky, sliding mirrors on the wardrobe doors, adjacent to the bed; reflecting everything like a movie. Taking me from behind, he got straight to work, no messing. He seemed like a new man, really energetic. Proper little super stud. The night seemed to go on	rever, and so did the sex. He was really enjoying himself, and just didn’t want the night to end. Like a horse with the bit between its teeth.   
   We eventually curlec4 up between the sheets. After what seemed like an eternity, it was warm ance cosy. He pulled me tight to his chest and I buried my head beneath his chin. ""That was great, Babe."" he said. I didn't say anything back, I just stared at, at him and smiled. I was really happy just to shut my eyes, even if it was only for three hours. Gareth had a very early morning flight and we had to leave the hotel at 6:00 in the morning to make his seven o’clock flight back to the UK.  When the alarm went off he was still fast asleep. ""Gareth, Gareth, wake up."" I said, ""It's time to wake up."" I jumped on top of him and started kissing his face. He grabbed hold of me again and didn't want to let go. ""Uh-uh, there's no time for that, you need to get in the shower.""  He was all over the place that morning, totally disorientated. After we  both showered and got dFessed, he was leaving the room and forgetting his passport. As  we walked  down the lobby  and into the lift, I noticed his flies were undone. ""Darling, look at me,"" I said, ""look down, do your trousers u{ ."" ""Oh oh, yes, yes."" I c4on't think he knew whether he was in the (JK or in Tenerife. His head was racing; I could see it in his eyes.   
    
   15.   
   When we got back we  crasned out, cudctled up and started talking, probably for at least another hour, and then fell asleep. It wasn’t always about the sex. We actually enjoyed each other’s company. Although having said that, he was always very frisky in the mornings, and the next morning was no different. It was a stable diet of sex for breakfast before the real breakfast.   
  16.   
   And in a roundabout way, this is what I told him. “I found the outfit that I’m going to wear, Gareth. What do you think?” “Yeah, that’s nice.” I said,  “You’re  not even looking  at  it.”  He  sod, “No, I’m looking at you.” I was in my underwear again, and we had another  sex session as a little starter before our main course with Ricky Hatton. As we got dressed and walked down the stairs for lunch, he took my hand and said to me, “I’ve got to tell you, you've given me the test sex I’ve had in 20 years.” “Really,” I said. He said, “Yes, really.” And that night we had at the Hard Rock Hotel, well, that was out of this world. I must admit I had detected from his behaviour that the sex life he had with  his wife must’ve been incredibly routine, as at the start of our relationship he totally lacked adventure.  When I mention things like baby oil, he would kind of like look at me like, What? Hmm. He was on a journey of discovery  and adventure with me. Almost like an education, and each sex session was a different class.  17.  He turned to me and put his arm around me, cuddling me as 1 was sleeping, as if he got a sense of how annoyed I was feeling and said again, ""Donna, I really do love   your company,"" he said kissing me on the lips. I said ""okay, that's nice. Now go to sleep and try not to snore."" He joked with me that I was the one that used to snore. And we both fell asleep.   
  18.   
   He told me that he had told Cath everything. I wondered what everything was exactly. He said she had questioned him about me changing my outfits, (after she had spotted this in photos from my Facebook page).But If he had told her “quote, unquote” everything, then she would not have been asking such questions. She would have known that we had spent the night together. It I ecame clear to me that he had been selective in his choice of words, but this was once again a face-to-face conversation.  A couple of days later, after saying goodb	to my family in the UK, I went (rack to Tenerife. We were now just a few days away from Christmas. I pondered what he was going to do for Christmas. People in Mansfield thought he would be coming to me, but as he's got two boys, this would have been inappropriate, although we did have a chat about it. He told me he didn't feel he could have a normal family Christmas with Catherine there had been a big Christmas Indian meal planned but he didn't feel welcome as the c4iscovery on National TV of me with him at the boxing match did not go down well. His son, Joel, who had met me on our first date, recognised me and told his mother, “that's Donna from Tenerife”. So Catherine had, obviously, then looked on his Facebook and discovered me. He said apparently, the whole room had gone silent, when the pictures came on the screen showing us together.  19.   
   He had gone to the meal after all. He told me how people had plotted to put them together during the meal in the hope that they would sort out their differences but alas, he also told me that that was never going to happen. He described  how  Catherine  was  crying  and  asking  to  be  his best friend and how he told her that it was far too late for that.   
    
   20.   
   That night was our first night together for a while and it was a bit of a frenzied sexual reunion, but quick. We were both tired and we had the entire week.   
  21.   
   How had have things got between you and Catherine?” I said, “Really bad, Donna.” “What does that mean ’really bad’? Don’t you think you’ll ever want to try again? It is early days after all.” “No, I just couldn’t.”, “But why?” “It’s all done between us, Donna, and it’s been months since we have been intimate. We only speak now about the boys, and it’s by text message. There’s not any real talking between us.” “But how has it got this bad between you?” “It’s happened over time,” he said.   
   “We slowly started living separate lives, arid she started going out with her friends and coming back at four in the morning.  I couldn’t  deal with that, arid like I told you before, she left me before, said she didn’t love me. She’s done that twice, and I can’t go through it a third time.  She doesn’t get on with lots of my family as well.” He then went on to explain that after the lottery, his two brothers were given just £0.5 million each, and they blamed Catherine for this, although it was a joint decision. Indeed, apparently, the two women, his sister-in-law and Catherine, had a physical fight, and their family has never been the  same again.

I feel really sorry for your Mum and Dad, I ecause now you’re all  split  apart.  Christmas  must  be  very difficult for them. It’s a real shame that money’s managed to do this to you guys. It really isn’t everything.” “No, I was gonna give them some more, it all just got out of hand,” he explained, “and I believe they were (blaming Cath unfairly. It was a joint decision.”   
    
  22.  . Gareth wa.s gettuig  more anc4 more coiHident iiric4 relaxed with me, he was losing all his sexual inlñbitions.. He took off all his clothes and laid on the bed and I thought, ""Wow, we are eager.""   
   I falled about, almost shocked, and put on the television,  walked  around a bit, went to the mini fridge and took out some wine, sat in the chair and SipPed it just lOOking at him, giggling.  ""Aren't  you  gonna come and join us then?"" I said, ""Wait your turn."" in a fun way. Then slowly I kicked off my high heels, slipped off my dress, but left my underwear on. Climbed across the bed like a pussycat on all tours and jumped on top of him, teasingly I pinnecl his arms bac-k and said, ""Now you can’t move, can you? I'm sat on your chest."" He kind of looked at  me like, ""Yes I can if I want to."" But he didn’t want to. I kissed him for several minutes and he was clearly getting excited. ""Ah-ah, exon’I rush it."" I told him. I got the baby oil out and started to massage it into his chest. Turned and said to me, ""What's  that, baby oil?"" I saicl, ""Yeah, baby oil."" It was incredible, ""I don't know what he anal his estranged wife used to get up to, but simple things like baby oil, really are no big deal?"" I thought to myself. He started to chill and relax and then I made love to him and he loved it.  I only load a little g-string on and had I een teasing him, pretending to do my squats, keeping my knickers  on,  but  this didn’t  last  long ‘cause he nearly rips them off. I really enjoyed lieing in control and staying on top, and making him be the subnussive one. Our sex sessions were becoming  increasingly  creative.  I won’t reveal all here, ha ha. Some things are going to stay private.But suffice to say  there wasri’t  left much to the imagination. The sex between us was good, there is no denying that. There was a chemistry between us and we  just seemed  to know what made the other one tick.   
   We eventually went to sleep, the great thing was we knew we didn't have to get up early, only for breakfast.The next morning, I can remember  the sun streaming  through the half open curtains which we’d forgotten to close. Thank gooc4ness, our ground floor room was not near anyone else. I woke up with Gareth on top of me, kissing my neck. “I’m feeling really horny babe” he saic4 to me. “Ooh I can feel that” I said track to him, ance we load another round of I reakfast sex. We were like proper little honeymooners.   
  23.   
   He took my hand and slowly he lead me back to our second floor room with the view of the ocean. He unlocked the door, closed it, and lifted me up. As we both collapsed onto the bed, I wriggled free and jumped on top of him, but he wasn’t in the mood to be dominated. He flipped me around and pinned me to the bed. I didn’t like not being able to move, though. I, too, was not in the mood to be dominatecl a	I pleaded with him, ""Gareth, I don’t like this posihon, I want to move."" He just smiled at me, slowly, slowly beconñrig more and more sexually aroused. He started kissing my neck.    
   ""I've still got all my clothes on,"" I taunted him. ""Not for long,"" he whispered in my ear, as he slowly, but surely peeled off my shorts, then gently running his hands up my top, inside my bra to feel my nipples.  Tonight it was me that was lying back, thinking of England. I lay there c{uietly moaning as he kissed me from my head right down to my toes. Mr Millions was not in the mood to take any prisoners tonight and before I knew it, we were making love again, missionary style, but oh, so boring, I thought, as I lifted my legs up to wrap them around his neck. That seemed to give him a new lease on life and we tried just about every sexual position known to man that night.   
   He certainly had some staying power, but was getting really, really rough with it, and I started to scream. That seemed to make him even worse, because he thought I was screaming through the passion. I didn’t have the heart to tell him it was because it wasn“t through the passion, it was through the pain. But ladies, I'm sure we've all been there with that one. At the end of the night, he asked me ""are you all right? Did you enjoy that?"" ""Of course I did, darling,"" I smiled sweetly back,"" thinking, well, you are no super stud, but God loves a trier.  Practice makes perfect and I'm going to teach you. I smiled to myself. The next day we woke up really, really late and almost missed breakfast. Shaking me awake, ""Donna, Donna, look at the time. We're about to miss breakfast.""   
   ""Oh my goodness, we can't have that, can we?"" He said, ""QuicMy, get yourself ready. We can come back and get showered."" I said, ""No, I have to shower."" So, I leapt into the shower and quickly got ready.  Oddly, Gareth always likecl to have a shower after breakfast, which I found Peculiar. I suppose he needed breakfast, having hurried so much energy the night before. It’s so true what they say about the sex diet  keeping you slim. We were both on Cloud Nine that morning and floated down to breakfast, like a couple of teenagers on honeymoon.   
    
    
   24.  ""Don’t worry, I'll soon leave everything sorted out. When I get back I'm going to have a separation agreement with Cath and once the money is sorted out and the agreement is signed, we can see as much of each other a.s we like. But, until then, we need to be a bit careful. It's an awful lot of money to loae and I want to make sure we get the right agreement. And if she finds out about you, she could use it against me in the divorce, and even name you, Oottna, anal I don’t want that.""   
   'his is beginning to make me feel like I'm an affair and you're just secretly seeing me and plan to go back to your wife."" He picked up my hand, ""Donna, I promise you, I sincerely promise you that that is not the case. I’ve got my own place now. We've just got to sort out the money. I'd love to be able to see much more of you, but I need to sort out this financial situation first."" It was a case of who he wanted and who he needed. He wanted me, but needed her to protect his fortune. He then changed the subject to me and the clown, Billy. ""What are you going to be doing about him?"" I said, ""Well, the divorce papers are already with the solicitor.   
   They‘ve been there a while, I had to get a little thing called an apostille on all the documents before they could be processed, which held up the process. And then, what with, you know, the business and the bar, things have been put to the back burners. But over here it doesn’t take long to get out of a marriage. It's more a situation of organising the children.""   
   ""Oh, I see,"" he said, ""Yes, I've got a bit of that going on with the boys. I've just said that they can come and see me any time they like. Open house,""  25.   
   As I lay on his chest, I again noticed that he had sleep apnoea. He would suddenly stop breathing in the middle of the night just for a few seconds and I had to sort of shake him. It was c{uite worrying, really.  He also had a slightly irregular heartbeat. I thought, ""He needs a bit of a health check here. I'll tell him in the morning."" But I was awake half the night, just listening to him, making sure he was still breathing. I always had this insecurity that the people and things that I loved most in my life I ended up losing. I suppose this  comes  from losing  my father at such an early age and then my daughter. I was awake, watching him sleep, until probably abotit five o'clock in the morning where, through shear exhaustion, I fell asleep.  I awoke the next morning lying across his chest, under his arm. He was wide awake with his  phone in his hand. He hadn’t bothered  to wake me up. He gazec4 down and, with a start, saicâ, ""Oh, you're awake. I didn’t want to disturb you. You looked tired."" I giggled and said, ""I hope I wasn’t snoring."" He laughed.  He said, ""You were."" That reminded me. I said,  ""You have really got to go and get yourself checked by the doctor. you've got sleep apnoea."" He said, ""What?"" I said, ""You kept stopping breathing."" He said, ""Did I?"" I said, ""Yes, you did, you really did. You need to get it checked. It's worrying me. If you're on your own when it happens, who's going to wake you up?"" ""No, I'll wake myself up. It's just the drinking."" ""But maybe not,"" I said, ""Always worth a little check-up. Put the phone down now, darling."",   
  26.   
   And we had our usual round of breakfast sex, but he was a lot more affectionate than usual, a lot more kissing and cuddling before and after. We then rushed for breakfast, which we nearly missed again, and it was so Ginny.  The guy sat on the table next to us kept smiling. I wondered why he was sufiling. I said, ""Gareth, look, do you know that guy? He keeps suñliiig over at us."" He said, ""No, I don’t recognise lim:"" It was onh• wlteii we retunied to the room we noticed lie was returiiing to the same corriéior and lie went into the room next door with his o•ife. I std, ""Oh. my gootliiess, so lie's been putting up chilli ‹Al the noise next door for  the last ieiv days."" It was funny. Gareth then saitl, ""Oh, *come* *on*y*,*	re've  got to love our shower now. Maybe we should give lint souietlung to  smile about again."" And we tooth stripped on and went into the shower.  It prys quite a big shower.   
  27.   
   ""Do yoti want me to start scrubbing your back?"" he std, kissing my meek, tuning me arotmd. ""Hiiun, yes, that'd be nice."" I turned arouiut, put niv axis around lus shoulders and std, Oliver To•ist stvle, ""Please, sir, can I have some more?"" He giggled. He said, ""Oh, come oii, let's get  back into bed."" I said, ""lYliat? No, I’m iii the shower. \\Vliat's the matter with von, Gareth? Whei’e's vour seise of adveiitiue? It’ll be like making love ii the rain."" ""No, ft's not the same,"" lie said, J›ulling me out of the shower and drying ore with a  towel I elore tluowiiig me onto the leed ior our ihlal round or rampant sex on our little lioiievniooii week.   
  28.   
   Catherine was being iicrediblv diilictilt, She knew  soiiietl0tig  was going on and she was coiistaiitly arranging for hint to have the boys when there was no football, when lie could possibly travel back to see me. She was using the clñldren as a way o1 keeping control over line to make stire lie didn’t have enough time or lits herds to have aiother relationslup with aaybodq propei’lv. That's what it appeared to be like.  He was forever telling me ""Oh, I've got the boys this weekend,"" or ""I'jre  got th	t›oys in the week, so it's going to be difhcult to travel wvw1iei’e or do wytlung."" I didn’t hold tlus ag	st Um, obviously our clñldren always cfime first, but I could see that games were lieing played here md	ots oi womeii did it. Tlus was how it appeared to be to me.  29.  I asked him  had he ,sorted out the settlement with Catherine. He said lte'd been to see the financial advisor and tliev were woikuig thi’oug1i it, but had he reall *77*  30.   
   ""Yes, but babe, we haven’t got the divorce agreement for the money sorted out. I need to get this agreement sorted out with the money first.""   
  31.  We went up to bed md the room was rely warm and cosy, it actually made you want to take your clothes off. The shower wash large anlt spacious and so was the bath and it all ielt very warm and cosy. Me net Gareth curled up in bed. He peeled my stress off and we got sexually reuiuted again, it had been a few weeks alter all. 8ut, you know, there was something a1›out that night tlmt got alami hells ringing iii my head. Was it what he said or the way lie did tlfings? I don’t know, but we made love and it was of couree wonderful, but different. As we curled up in bed ell snug in the wami, thick duvet with the central heating piping out, heat like we were iii the Caribbean, I opened my eyes. My nñiid woe racing. The sex was different, what was going on? Had lie been y›racticiilg on someone else?  32.   
  . We made our way back upstairs  to the zoom and crashed out onto the bed and cuddled up.   
   As we were cud‹1led up, Gareth was squeezing me tightly, telling me lie loved me. ""Doniia, you do know I love you, don’t you?"" ""Yes, yes and I love you too, halve."" ""No, honestly, I really, really love you."" I said, ""Okay, dai’1iilg. Go to sleep."" \\Ye had a little kiss arid then we just went to sleep, About halfway though the iught he got really fidgety and sat Holt iq.»’iglit in bed. I pretended to be still asleep and not notice. And lie just stored at me, maybe tlñnking to 1 mseli, ""Did I really say what I was whirling?"" ""Yes, you did darling, and I remeni1›eted, even though we'd been drñiking.""  33.   
   ""Come on,“ I said to  him, ”let's have some birthday sex.” And so we did.   
    
    
   We were really getting to know each other now and as the relationship was progressing, so was the sex. He was getting to know what I liked and I was getting to know what he liked and it was just good. There was no getting away from it, the sex between us was amazing.  Afterwards he just looked at me with puppy dog eyes, telling me that he’d enjoyed himself, and then went into deep thought.   
  34.   
   And he said, ”We're trying to sort out the financial agreement, I’m going to see three different solicitors and I'm going to pick one."" I said, ”Well, pick them really, really carefully because you know what they're all about. At the end of the day you've got the money and they're going to try and do what's best for them first before they do what's best for you. So just be careful."" ”I will,"" he said,   
   35.   
   He said, ""me and Cath are done. I’m definiteI5• getting divorced. There’s no way I’m going hack there.  36.   
   And then we went up to bed, where we had a lot of fun, actually, and laughs. I hopped into bed in my underwear, and he started tickling me. I sat on his back and gave him a little massage, and this turned into playing, as well. He load a really early morning flight to Manchester before his game, and needed to leave at six o’clock.   
   It was hardly worth going to bed, but we did eventually crash out together. I curled up and placed my head on his chest, and we both fell asleep. It all felt so natural, like we’d never been away from each other. There was a deep and proper connection between us. Chemistry that just didn’t die with the weeks and months that passed. It was like an electricity that wouldn’t switch off.  So many weeks h	passed, since I’d seen him, yet, we were still both buzzing for each other.   
   When the alarm clock went in the morning, I was half asleep, but I could feel him looking over me, moaning wanting his usual morning sex, but there not being enough time. Eventually, he dragged himself away, and jumped in the shower.",Banned Books- Freedom of Expression,1577801508

books,"**TLDR I'm just listing things I found interesting about this book and Mersault. I don't have a proper conclusion to this post. Still readinf about the book. Hopefully someone can explain what this book is about. 

I feel quite indifferent about this book. I don't *like* it but I don't dislike it either.

Certain parts that were outstanding though: 
1. The fight scene got me pumped up. 
2. I expected a fight to get him in trouble, so when he killed, I was shocked. (Back of the book called it a ""random act of violence)
3. The announcement of his sentence hit really hard. I got the chills. Firstly, I love The Idiot, and there's a scene in which he explains a person's last few minutes before the guillotine. Secondly, my lecturer once said, ""No matter how many times you've heard it (in court), you will always get the chills when someone is sentenced to the gallows."" 
4. His outburst against the chaplain was so good. I read Meursault's lines so enraged, shouting throughout. That was an awesome scene. 
5. The particular line where he says, sometimes you wish that a person you love was dead. I know what that's like. It's not out of hate, but out of pain.

Now, for the philosophical part. Correct me if I am wrong. I think Mersault is meant to be the embodiment here of some philosophy. He didn't care much for his mother's death, not that he found it meaningless, but that he accepted it very easily. I think that's why he didn't cry. He was just too stoic about it. They say not to cry over spilled milk. Here's a guy who didn't but he was condemned for it. I mean, he did think of his mum, didn't he? I think he didn't stop loving her. 

Next, I admit that the 'absurdity' went over my head while reading the trial scenes. Only later I realised while reading about the book that the prosecutor and jury were harping way too much on his lack of apparent emotions towards his mother's death in comparison to the murder itself. The jury did not like that he did not display grief for his mother's death, and that made him a criminal. The trial was flawed. They were distracted by something apart from the ""unfortunate event"". It is as if I was one of the jury while still in the perspective of Mersault.

As for his lack of remorse towards killing the Arab man. I don't know guys. Maybe Mersault didn't care much for someone who followed them with a knife and tried to beat them up. Maybe he really just doesn't feel sorry for the man because there's nothing he knows about the man that he should be sorry for. But nobody asked him to explain this. Even his lawyer didn't ask him about this. This is no justification for a killing a person but it is a valid question here: how remorseful should he feel here about killing someone he knows as an adversary?? 

Alright, maybe some of you may not like a reference to Joker but it's recent, those who watched it surely remember it - he killed the 3 boys and didn't feel remorseful about it. He later said he found it funny. Reading between the lines, I think we can see that Joker/Arthur felt that his killing them was justified because they were the aggressors, and not just aggressors in that incident but potential aggressors just about anywhere (because they're 'the rich'). 

So... Mersault didn't show much remorse, he wasn't sorry for it and he didn't pretend that he was remorseful about it. He is... honest! He was honest to Marie when she asked if he loved her and whether he would marry her. He didn't pretend that he was remorseful. He just let the trial carry on. 

I'm sorry that I don't have a proper conclusion. I'm still reading about the book and about absurdism. Hopefully someone can shed some light and make this book clearer. I'm not sure what to take away from this.",Just read The Outsider (The Stranger) by Albert Camus,1577788147

books,"Hey everyone,  
 My name is Nino. INTP 1w2 sp/sx tritype 145 here and I love to read books. 

 I write this post to recommend you my favorite author. I’m a big fan of Alessio David Ricioppo Parra and his coaching books. He is a genius writer and his knowledge will never be obsolete.

 Each of his books is an absolute masterpiece. For instance he created an universal translator between masculine/active and feminine/passive role in romantic courtships that always works. Yes, it’s the universal translator between men and women. And it always works! It's called ***The Pandora's Box - the forbidden truth about dating and relationships.*** 

 He also wrote the best book by far on the market about the topic of jungian analysis and the psychology of communication… And it’s basically telepathy in real life. It's called ***Kerberous - the hound of Apocalypse***.

In particular I highly recommend you to read his “***WTK (Witnessing Tantric Kerberous) system - Activate your greatness***” as he fused all his previous coaching books in one and interconnected them with an extremely accurate template of human nature. You can find it on Lulu as well as in Amazon.

 It’s an absolute masterpiece and a must read for everyone!","""WTK (Witnessing Tantric Kerberous) system - Activate your greatness"": What an absolute masterpiece!",1577787975

books,"Well this worked earlier with a book I couldn’t find so I figured I’d try again. 
Many years ago I read a book that I think was called talent. I remember loving it a lot when I was about 12. 
The premise of this book is that earth is at war with aliens. And the earth defence is taking children and basically putting them into camps. In these camps the children are tested to find their “talents” so that they may be used in the war against the aliens. 
The protagonist is a young girl, who comes home one day to find her home destroyed, her parents dead/missing (can’t remember) and her brother vanished. 
She ends up meeting up with one of her brothers underground contacts but in the end they’re both captured and sent away to these camps. 
There they are tested to find out their true talents. Whether it be leadership, maths, etc. 
I’d love to reread this to see what my younger self saw. 
Any info greatly appreciated.",Looking for a book called Talent. Forgot author. YA,1577784242

books,"I just finished Ron Chernow's ""Alexander Hamilton"" and I loved it. The amount of detail he put into that book was amazing. I cannot fathom how much dedication it took to be that thorough. I'm definitely interested in checking out his biographies of George Washington and Ulysses S Grant. However, there's a part of me that doesn't want to take that on yet due to how hefty those books are. Anyway, Hamilton's biography was incredible. It was so rich and interesting. There was definitely some bias but it was as impartial as one could be when writing about one's life who you have spent so much time researching. I loved it.
