books,"I am in awe of this novel. It has truly hit me at a deep level. I have always been a bit idealist and I’m a huge fan of dystopian/utopian novels. One of my all time favorite books has always been Island by Aldous Huxley, I completely bought into his utopia. The Dispossessed, however, turns the idea of a utopia and dystopia up on its head. There will never be a perfect society and we need to realize that we with everything we gain, we lose something too. 

Would you rather be born at random on a world with no war, no poverty or famine, equality among the sexes, no rules or government, but with very little natural resources and a economic system that requires a lot of hard labor....

Or,

on a world with innumerable riches and natural resources for wealth but with all the downfalls of traditional Earth style societies, castes, sexism, war, poverty and all the rest where only a few enjoy the riches while the masses are reduced to complete poverty and slavery.

books,"I don't know how popular this book is, but it's very polarizing, as it attacks the heart of neoliberalism/corporatism as envisaged by Milton Friedman and the ""Chicago School"" economic principles that were adopted by many governments across the Earth from the 70s to today.

The book examines the principle of electroshock therapy as it was developed in relation to psychology and brainwashing (of particular interest to the CIA in project MKUltra). This same ""shock treatment"" was how Friedman felt his corporatist economic vision could best be enacted. In extreme brief, Friedman wanted absolute minimum government, basically nothing beyond military/defense, and felt the free market would self-regulate everything from prices, wages, supply, demand. Any failing of an economy was due to ""distortions"" as some form of unnecessary intervention. Shock on a national level, say by a coup de etat, would allow for a society to rebuild according to his ""pure"" capitalist vision. This was applied in Chile with Pinochet, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, etc.

The same principles were applied after disasters like the 2004 Tsunami, or Hurricane Katrina. The shock of Katrina allowed George Bush to push a neoliberal darling policy (charter schools) through. The New Orleans Public School system was essentially gutted and replaced with a voucher program to charter schools. 

It was pure coincidence that I picked this book up last week, but it's quite prophetic. I was prompted to post this thread after reading about the couple in Vancouver that bought tens of thousands of bottles of lysol and are trying to resell them. The quote from the hoarder was about fixing the ""inefficiencies of the market"". This is verbatim Friedman/Chicago school language. Other concepts discussed this week have included ""helicopter money"", a Friedman proposal to basically give away money. 

What's the big picture though? Pay attention to what has happened and what is being discussed. The fed approved $1.5 trillion to basically bail out shareholders overnight. Think about the last time any proposal even a tenth this costly was ever moved on so quickly. The shock of COVID allowed this corporatist policy to slip through. Another policy discussed was cutting payroll taxes as a ""stimulus"". While you could debate the merits of this proposal, Trump has explicitly wanted to cut payroll taxes to zero, permanently. COVID is the shock that puts society into a state of malleability, and policies with generational consequences will slip through. The flip side of this, politically speaking, would be pushing for medicare for all, paid sick leave, free testing and treatment, etc.

Anyway, politics aside, this book was practically written for the COVID-19 Pandemic. If you can stand to read political books from a progressive point of view, this is a must read.",The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein is Hyper-Relevant for a COVID-19 Dominated Earth,1584226463

books,"\- So I did a thing. I read The Devil In The White City, and found it to be excellent, as everyone who had recommended the book to me (and there were many), had said. I really loved how so many events occurring before, or during, the Chicago's World Fair Exposition, connected to much big occurrences in early 20th century American history. And this is a conundrum for me, because I would like to discuss some of these happenings, but I feel a great strength of this book is in the reveals, and I would hate to spoil that for those who haven't read it. So, I will attempt to talk about the more general elements of the book I had opinions on.

\- I am surprised, and somewhat saddened, Daniel Burnham is not a more celebrated icon in American History. I confess, rather ashamed, this was the first instance I had read about the supreme architect. Being a salty New Yorker, I read with a smirk on all the obstacles and ridiculousness this man, his artistic partner John Root, and his team, had to endure to erect this phenomenon of manufacturing. And, by the end, I was rooting for a man who had accomplished the impossible. Unbelievable feat that he was able to erect most of the fair in the extremely short window he was given. 

\- I felt Frederick Olmstead was a tragic figure, and was frustrated alongside him at every decision. Mayor Harrison Carter seemed a fantastic man who led one of those unique lives. As did, obviously, Buffalo Bill Cody. His moment with the brave Susan B. Anthony is iconic. There are many figures of history that appear in this snapshot of 1893, and I would encourage anyone to see for themselves what happens to them.

\- Dr. H.H. Holmes. What an incredible fiend and bastard. And, yet, apparently he held extreme powers of pursuasion and possession of the men and women of Chicago, and elsewhere. One of America's most prolific serial killers, Holmes existed in that perfect age, and place, where missing persons were not investigated as fervently as today. The extreme ignorance of his neighbors, his residents, and the Chicago PD was appalling. Larson delved into the gruesome details of his deeds- it is astonishing, sickening, and I absolutely could not put the book down. Bone-chilling, and worth the read for that alone. Christ, this world has harbored some evil men. What is wrong with us?

\- The city of Chicago itself seemed a city transformed. On a side note, I began reading this book during the now suspended NBA season's last All Star game, and there pre-game tribute to Chicago kind of helped set up a flavor for the city. Cool story, right? Industrial-era Chicago was black--black buildings smeared with the stains of industry, black streets caked with macadam and tar, black air filled with smoke and smog. Black deeds made ambitious, young American women vanish. A slaughterhouse of hogs and haunts, Chicago was the dirty younger brother to preeminent New York. The fair changed all of that, as Larson's extensive work shows, and changed the way we see architecture even today. I truly caught a tangible glimpse of the city, its origins, and its culture, and see why it remains a wonder. It became ""The White City"", and was mourned as a revered martyr for arts, beauty, and leisure when it shut down in October 1893. It was looked upon as a transformative, almost spiritual event by those who attended, either common or grandstanding. It's one of those moments in time, I wish I could access through a sort of time machine or otherwise. Magic and Mayhem reigned.

&amp;#x200B;

“I was born with the devil in me,' Holmes wrote. 'I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing.”

&amp;#x200B;

“No one could bear the idea of the White City lying empty and desolate."" A Cosmopolitan writer said, ""Better to have it vanish suddenly, in a blaze of glory, than fall into gradual disrepair and dilapidation. There is no more melancholy spectacle than a festal hall, the morning after the banquet, when the guests have departed and the lights are extinguished.”",My Thoughts on The Devil In The White City by Erik Larson,1584223900

books,"As a child, I always loved reading. It was my natural escape from reality. I carried this passion with me throughout the years, but when I slowly succumbed to the symptoms of depression, I completely lost sight of the things that were important to me. 

Recently, I talked to several therapists, who encouraged me to speak about my childhood experiences. Reading was not encouraged in my household. Who had time to read when there was so much to do around the house? I recounted probably my worst childhood memory: when my mom took all of my books to the dumpster. One of the books was, at the time, my most prized possession. It was an extremely rare book that my favorite English teacher had given me the day that she told us she was moving to another school.

I was encouraged to let go of my remorse and the guilt I associated with reading and I was determined to rekindle my love for my favorite pass time. Out of the blue on the first day of classes, I picked up one of the ""dollar"" books from my university library. It was *Contagion* (fitting, I know).

I’ve just finished The double after finishing Notes from Underground the other day, which I really loved, but there’s something about the double I need to discuss. 
It’s a strange book, or I thought so anyway, the ending definitely explains some of it due to his mental state being somewhat revealed... but still, there’s something about this book that’s really got under my skin, and I’d maybe go as far as saying it made my skin crawl at certain points. I must repeat I really loved this book and it seems to have quite an impact on me that I can’t pinpoint, unlike notes from underground which had a very definite impact. 

Has any else had a similar experience with The Double? Where should I go next with Fyodor’s work? Crime and Punishment? Brothers Karamazov? Demons?

books,"""Brothers karamazov"","" idiot"", ""crime and punishment"" and ""demons"" are considered the 4 masterpieces. All of the books are absolutely amazing and will blow everyone away if read carefuly. Through these novels Dostoyevsky comments on all the most important aspects of our lifes: relationships, morals, religion and the meaning of life. Giving himself difficult counterarguments to whatever he is trying to teach and then answer them. The books mostly comment on similar ideas, therefore you will gain a better understaning of the same idea without it being repetitive. That is why most of his ""villains"" let's call them in their essence are the same, nihlistsic atheists who are aware of the absuridty of life, and also happent to be very smart, these characters are : Raskolnikov from crime and punishment, Ivan from Brothers Karamazov, Kirilov from Demons. All of his characters represent ideas and different personalities in which i believe most of us can find ourselves in.

In case you are interested in the books i would read them in this order. 1.Brothers Karamazov 2. Crime and punishment 3. Idiot 4.demons

Despite having the mental images and constant Morgan Freeman narration happening in my mind while reading, I still found myself genuinely enthralled and into it emotionally, following Red in his journey. 

Ive heard the movie-is-better-than-the-book narrative about this story in particular, but I honestly didn’t find the story lacking where the movie hit a home run. Of course, good acting helps the movie, but I find King’s writing style to be so engaging and textural, the details he offers transport me to that moment for the character (“I went to the rock, squatted beside it- the joints in my knees went off like a double-barrelled shotgun- and I let my hand touch it. It was real.”), and the small addition of noting the sound his knees make just add an additional layer of realism to a huge moment for the character, that would be otherwise only be described by his feelings about what he was doing.

I don’t know, I’m not an expert in understanding how author’s create their material and who I should be reading, etc. I just find it to be deeply enjoyable reading Stephen King for reasons like this.

books,"Am I the only one who doesn't get the hype for this collection?

If you're interested in 20th century short stories, chances are you've heard of this book. It's generally considered one of the best collections of the century. Kis is treated like one of the most important voices in European literature from this era. You see everywhere that he's praised for ""combining fiction and history in a genius postmodern fashion"". So, of course, needing more short stories to read, I decided to pick this up in my local library. I was pretty excited to read it, because I've had a Borges shaped hole in my life since finishing everything of his I could find a while back. And Kis did sound like a pretty similar writer, albeit with his own distinct features, so I thought he would serve to scratch the spot.

And I wasn't wrong, he is similar to Borges. But that's the entire problem.

Kis reads, at least here, like he's a child only starting off as a writer. Starting off, using Borges as a template. Thinking ""man, Borges is such a cool writer, I'd love to write like him"". So that child picks up a pen, grabs a page, and tries to write Borges. Just kind of writes the first thing they can think of that he would have wrote. And it comes out pretty Borgesian. But without any of the heart or soul of Borges. It reads like someone trying to be Borges, like a store brand version. If you took Borges, took away everything that made him Borges. And then still expected him to write the same genius shit those experiences gave to him. That's who Kis is. The store brand version of Borges. His prose reads like Borges, but without any of the passion. Like if Borges had've tried to move in another direction, but kept writing Fictions type shit because it was how he made his money. It's cold, lifeless, and just makes you crave Borges more than ever. So reading the stories becomes a huge slog. But you wouldn't mind if the stories were good. Not all good books need to have good prose.

But the stories aren't good. The prose isn't the only thing that feels like a bored Borges. The very plots of the story themselves feel like they were rooted out of Borges's scrap bin. It's Borges, if he wasn't so clever. If he wasn't so meta. If he didn't feel the need to tear apart a different convention with every story he wrote. It feels like those stories every writer has where they put them away and are completely ashamed for ever having written them. The concepts are so bland. Man says Jesus bad, performs miracle. Prostitute dies, big funeral. Book of all people who die. And these stories could've been good. If Kis could have written them properly. A true master of imaginative short fiction, whether it's Borges or Kafka or Lovecraft or someone else entirely, could've made these stories genius. Could've filled them out with amazing details, made them stick in the mind. But not Kis. He just did then how Borges would have done them. But without a single inch of the boldness. Of the charm. Of the wonder. Of the power. Of the originality. Does Borges, but with none of the Borges.

According to Wikipedia, one of the stories in this collection is considered to have stolen from Borges. But not all of them. Why not all of them

I've only read books in my native language, and I have to admit that I haven't been reading much novels lately, as I'd rather be reading in English, and fanfictions were the easiest way for me to do that.
