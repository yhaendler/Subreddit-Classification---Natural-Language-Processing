books,"Before I begin I would like to warn you I'm French so I might do some mistakes sorry about that. 

I'm reading Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (in English) for the first time and clearly one of the most known idea of the book is that one does not born a monster but is made a monster (in the case of the creature by the rejection of the humans). 
Although I think this idea might be true I don't know if I love it or not. 

I mean this idea makes me think about those serial killers who became bad because they suffured during their childhood. It is often explained in some documentaries as if it was an excuse for what they did. I think that having a terrible life is not an excuse for doing terrible things and I don't want to forgive them. 

That is exactly my ""problem"" with the creature in Frankenstein, I don't know if I despise him (even if the word despise might be too violent to express what I may feel) or if I feel sorry for him. I don't know if I want to forgive him.

books,"Whenever people criticize the work of a popular author, people always jump in to defend him/her with the classic argument that since the book is entertaining, it's good. In other words, the book knows what it is. It does its job. There's no need for literary value. 

I disagree with this notion, as in my opinion when we evaluate whether a book is good or not we are talking about both entertainment value (plot, character development) and the quality of the writing itself. A bad book might be successful, and in this case I respect the author for doing a good job at catering to his/her audience, but I believe the quality of the writing style is a factor in determining whether a book is actually good. 

The rebuttal to this argument is often that since many books are targeted at a younger audience, we should hold them to a lower standard. However, when I assess the quality of a book, I don't care about the writing level. I care about the fundamentals of writing, which are independent of writing level - sentence structure, proper use of adjectives (no purple prose), flow, stuff like that. Simple prose can still be good. 

Let's use two examples: A series of unfortunate events and The Da Vinci Code. I starting reading the former when I was five years old, the latter at sixteen. While series of unfortunate events is targeted at children, I believe that Daniel Handler is a far better writer than Dan Brown.

Often I’ll see, for example, a thriller that has multiple 5 star ratings, people calling it a page turner, read it in one sitting, couldn’t put it down, amazing plot, great twist, etc. And I’ll think “wow, well I have to read that!”

Well I don’t know if I just have high standards, but very often it’s just another throwaway tropey thriller, dialled-in plot, weak characters, ropey dialogue, no intrigue whatsoever, massive plot holes.

books,"Hi /r/books! So I recently became a father to an 11 year old who does not have the love of reading that I had when I was his age. In an effort to nudge him in the right direction, I have been building up a library of things I loved in 3rd-5th grade (his current reading level).

One of those was Wind in the Willows. Now, I was probably in 11 when I last read it, but I remember it introduction me to a lot of the Scottish vernacular that I would encounter in later classics of British literature (we are American)

We were at Half Price Books and they had four or five different versions of the book. They all looked really thin.

""I must have been misremembering the book as a pretty large one because I was such a little kid at the time,"" right?

So I start to compare each of the 4 editions in front of me. From the very first page, they are different from what I remember... and they are different from one another.

There are lots of colorful illustrations, which weren't in the one I read as a kid (I think there were simply black and white drawings back then). But the language seemed to be really Amerianized and simplified. Like they were written for ages 7-8 or so.

That's fine, I think. They clearly have American versions and they clearly have versions for younger kids.

But the thing is ... None of these editions said anywhere on the cover or near the front of the book that this was this edition or that editoon. All four of these books were written very differently, and anyone who didn't know any better would think that they were reading the original book!

What give?

More important, how can I get the original book? How in the world would I know? I don't need or want the original edition ... we aren't collectors ... I just want the normal, latest copy of the REAL version of this beloved classic!

It's a difficult book, hard and painful, but at the same time, it manages to be beautiful, something that moves you deeply and leaves you with a sense of hope. Alice Walker is a magnificent writer, and she is able to bring these characters to life, these great women who fight and search for their freedom. One really connects with Celie and Nettie in an intimate way, they become real people. The narrative voices are amazingly constructed, and you can't help but empathize, with their thoughts, their experiences, and their exploration of life.

This is an incredibly spiritual book, something that goes beyond religion, as it is a search for our own selves, for freedom and identity, something that comes from race and femininity. Is the understanding of the beauty of the universe, of the change we go through in our lives, with love and people that surround us.

books,"I would love to talk about the impact of the character of Neil, who I interpret as the ghostwriter of The Power. I found so much of this book frustrating, and at times thought it felt lazy in how it was imagining women would behave if they suddenly discovered they were physically able to dominate men. For example, the idea that most women in Saudi Arabia would suddenly unite against their male oppressors and start a civil war seemed to utterly fail to understand how family relationships complicate the ""sisterhood."" So while I found much of the speculation interesting, I didn't find it believable that there wouldn't be many, many women protecting their fathers or brothers or sons or husbands, or that none of those women would be in positions of power and fight against people like Mother Eve/Allie. I feel like any characters like this were framed in very minor ways, like the nun who thought Eve was demonic, instead of like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who would almost certainly side with the status quo and not a violently religious cult of women suddenly spreading on YouTube. 

But then I thought more about Neil. If we reinterpret the entire story through Neil's eyes, I might see how a man, thousands of years after the cataclysm, would fail to imagine a time when women and men had close relationships or shared power. I can understand why he may not have imagined women having close relationships with men. And it would be internally logical for his understanding of these events to be a bit flat, even as he is reimagining them in a way that is transgressive and speculative about the role that man used to play and questioning the idea that women have always been more powerful or that their tendency towards violence and cruelty is  a result of being powerful, and not inherent to being a woman. 

So, what do you think? Do you agree the portrayal of women and men is a bit shallow? And is it intentionally so, because ""Neil"" is supposed to have written it? Perhaps more so, because ""Naomi"" (his editor) may have rewritten parts of it or even stole it?","[SPOILERS] The impact of ""Neil"" in Naomi Alderman's The Power",1605367209

books,"I know that every outlet and social media outlet has been inundated with thoughts about Rooney so I’ll keep this focused on the novel. 

I just want to know if anyone else has the same issues as me. I haven’t seen the show, I actually picked the book up because I’d read online a short of her’s ""[Mr Salary](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/mr-salary-a-short-story-by-sally-rooney-1.3016223)"" which moved me. 

Unfortunately everyone is reading Rooney and I had no luck in the library and had to buy one of those terrible post-adaptation editions with the advertisement for the Hulu show on the front. 

Anyway --

I'm ignoring the pugnacious hype around Rooney  - ""greatest new millennial writer"", et al - and just focusing on the book in a vacuum.

I'll say outright that isn't really literary fiction, in the most core sense. It's not really a YA novel or a romance novel either and being ""genre"" isn't bad at all, I just think it's been fundamentally miscategioried.

I devoured the book in  day or two, the same way I would with a lightweight thriller. This, to me, shows it as a compelling read, but also not one that requires study. Rooney uses the exclusive third-person point-of-view of the two main characters as her prose and they are both analytical and intelligent, if bad at communicating (more on communication later). Normal People is filled with ""Marianne thought x"" and ""Connell felt y"" which meant that any requirement for analysis of the text by readers was gone  the characters did it for us. I know Connell ditches Marianne for the prom for another mean girl because the prose tells us - Connell felt anxious about his friends seeing him with Marianne, the allegedly frumpy high school he'd been sleeping with. Except this had already been established - we know this is what Connell wants and that he values he friend's views over Marianne. Having it read back to us an explanatory footnote for why a MC acted poorly is lazy.

To her credit, this is the only way that Rooney generally dumps info on the reader. Other parts of the story unfold at a more leisurely and natural pace, especially Marianne's abusive family, which we finally see the brunt of in the final chapters.

Some of the professional feedback I've read says this is ""class-conscious"" romance, and, while Rooney sets several scenes where characters discuss their different economic needs, she actually relies on the power imbalance developed by Connell (the economically deprived character) refusing to acknowledge Marianne in high school as the catalyst for conflict. There is one major conflict that arises due to class issues -- Connell loses his university job and can't pay rent. He's too embarrassed to ask to move in Marianne, who has a free apartment from her mother, and they break up (again). Another possible example is that Connell has to go to borrow money from Marianne at one point,.

But for the most part, the central conflict between Connell and Marriane is the fact that there was a time when Connell was embarrassed by her and (in her eyes) continues to be in some way. This is only resolved at the end when he decided to touch her in publics in front of their old high school friends.

This also (partly) informs Marianne's submissiveness to men , because her first relationship is with a guy who wants her as secret. She keeps getting in relationships with bad men who beat her in bed and berate her outside it. The book is unclear whether Marianne has a fetish for submissive roleplay or whether this is her low self-esteem; BDSM communities have criticized this as being inaccurate and said that sub/dom relationships can be consensual and safe. I don't know that was Rooney's point, exactly, but she could have been more clear about Marianne's engagement in BDMS play as an actual sexual preference rather than a character trait borne from trauma. It is important to note that the novel mostly ends with Marianne being ""saved"" from BDSM by engaging in thoughtful and safe sex with Connell, whose most submissive sexual action in the book is informing her quietly during sex ""you're all mine"" - and the book is unclear whether Connell is just doing this to please her.

Rooney's primary thesis, I suppose, is that these characters would have ended up together if they'd communicated properly. Which is a fine thesis; communication in relationships is important. However, the nature of the miscommunications Connell and Marianne experience are almost sitcom-level, and it makes you want to scream. When you have main characters who are supposed to be in their twenties who cannot verbally express themselves to one another properly (but their internal monologues are succinct, verbose and very clear), it's an irritating tool to re-use throughout.  


Regardless - this is enjoyable. it has been massively overhyped. it's unique in it's commitment to framing Marianne and Connell's passing by of each other at each stage of their life a primary plotting tool, something that is used rarely outside pure romance, to attempt (but, in my opinion, fail) to make some larger comments about barriers posed by class and communication.

books,"OK. So, as an aspiring writer, I was drawn to Romance fiction because it is virtually the bestselling genre in ebook stores. And after a lot of hesitation on my part, I decided to look at romance novels and short stories. What is so unique about them that attracts so many buyers?

What I've resolved so far about self-published romance is that they're mostly terrible. And here are two reasons why.

**1. Poor Writing**

If like me you've been spoilt by beautiful stained glass prose common in classics and literary fiction, you'd be turned off by the bland and monotonous prose of self-published fiction. To be fair, though this applies to most fiction published today. Even the traditionally published books. Widely successful and popular authors like Stephen King and David Patterson write very bland prose. 

With the Romance I've read, I'm amazed at the apparent lack of creativity on the writer's part. I mean, in order genre, the writers try to be creative in their writing, but rarely so for Romance writers. And this is because Romance writers have to publish rapidly in order to keep up with the insatiable demand of ravenous readers. So authors just type, edit grammar and spellings, and click publish.

**2. Harmful love stories**

Characters instantly falling in love with strangers whom they've only met. Then having sex very shortly after the first meeting. Often times the sex is unprotected, there is no fear of unwanted pregnancy or STI between the lovers. Note that most of the readers of these books are girls as young as 15, subconsciously learning about boys, love, and sex from these books. 

Learning about boys, love, and sex from Romance fiction is a recipe for disasters. It can bring about poor decision makings among these girls, culminating in rape, unwanted pregnancies, and STIs. STIs like Herpes, which is incurrable may be transmitted even with condoms, yet these romance writers are writing explicit scenes of unprotected sex as love stories for young girls.","Why Self-Published Romance Fiction Are Mostly Bad, Very Bad",1605362847

At first I hated Amir for exploiting And never standing up for Hassan, but loved how he just redeemed himself, and the twist that Hassan was actually his half-brother was shocking, and the part when we came to know that Hassan died, was heart breaking.

books,"Despite the internet making information more accessible than any other time in human history, political and cultural polarization is at the forefront of national conversation. Each side does not understand--and more importantly, refuses to understand--the other, ignoring millions upon millions of web pages that detail exactly why one side feels a certain way.  According to a 2014 Pew Research study, those who identified as Republican or Democrat felt animosity toward the opposing party at twice the reported amounts from 1994. Now, as America looks back the 2020 election and its consequences, violent rhetoric has been mounting, and actual attempts on politicians’ lives have been planned. Why and how does everyone feel that they are so unquestionably right? How can one side call Trump the worst president ever while the other side calls for his face to be placed on Mount Rushmore, even when both have access to the same information? Moral psychology and the refusal of an individual to admit that their side is the “wrong one” is the subject of Jonathan Haidt’s 2012 The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion, a book that has proved to be more and more relevant with each passing year and news cycle.

A book that judges psychology and its relationship to political and personal life is destined to one of two futures: prophecy or pseudoscience. Although seemingly brilliant at the time of their conception, ideologies that do not prove to be accurate save for a few situations can be deemed unsuccessful. The head and the heart’s relationship, or how emotions and reason interact, has been the subject of different philosophers’, politicians’, and psychologists’ speculations. Many of these theorizations are analyzed by Haidt in his first chapters along with their shortcomings. He ties each to political movements and schools of thought, where they came from, and where they do not succeed. As he does so, Haidt charts his own journey from a graduate student running experiments to his first pieces of published research, all the while developing the reader’s understanding of moral psychology along with his. As such, he contextualizes his argument in his field and the reader’s mind. He states that the grounds for morality are not just avoiding harm and promoting fairness, but that they are expansive, intuitive, and the foundations upon which people build their logic. In politics and religion, reason comes as justifications for gut feelings of respect and disgust. Individuals then align reason and logic with that feeling, and construct or join a hive around it. Often these hives are assigned from family or friend groups, and lead to further polarization and less critical thinking.

In the past eight years, Haidt’s work has proven to be growingly relevant. Disgust and distaste for the other side has become palpable enough to ignite far left and right groups, and politicians are unlikely to vote for another side’s policy out of principle, regardless of actual thought. When President Clinton was impeached in 1998, Alan Dershowitz (R) stated the following:

&gt;“It certainly doesn't have to be a crime if you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of president and who abuses trust and who poses great danger to our liberty, you don't need a technical crime.”


That is, in spite of acknowledging that the actions of the then-President were not a crime, Dershowitz (R) said that the President should be impeached regardless. This was almost certainly justified in his mind. The opposition, being wrong, should be impeached. Later, he served as President Trump’s attorney for his own impeachment. While this was happening, he said that quid pro quo wouldn’t matter, because as long as the President thought that his election was in the best interest of the country, he couldn’t be impeached. His hypocritical attitude isn’t one that acts alone, however. Rosa DeLauro (D), in Clinton’s 1998 impeachment, stated the following:

&gt;“Benjamin Franklin spoke of impeachment as an alternative to assassination. Today this body is contemplating a constitutional assassination, driven by a naked partisanship, almost without lawful and civil bounds, the Republican majority is moving to impeach an elected president of the United States”


She said that impeachment was a contemptible act, only happening when the opposition wished the current President dead. DeLauro (D) later voted to impeach President Trump in 2020. This, again, was likely fully justified in her mind. When impeachment happened to a candidate from her own party, it was an attack. When her hive was looking to impeach President Trump, it felt like a logical action based off of justice. Each side has constructed a hierarchy deeply separated from the other by moral reason, which, Haidt states, comes from a sense of loyalty to one community and their process of reason, rather than a commitment to truth. Different communities believe that they’re correct because of different logic rooted in different gut instincts. 

To prove this, Haidt presents studies he has conducted and compares the reactions of different nations, political communities, and individuals to hypothetical situations. He found that each of these groups understood morality in fundamentally different ways. When presented with situations that violate social rules or guidelines, the subject reacts in ways that align with a small set of certain values, including care, fairness, loyalty, authority, sanctity, and liberty, each of which then falls into different higher-order categories. Although Haidt states that these elements are subject to change, a person’s sensitivity to each can predict their political ideology. As such, a person’s opposition seems to be fundamentally blind to the world, as they don’t hold the values that the person understands to be true.

Empathy is tossed by the wayside, Haidt says, and apathy is taken in. This process of hypocrisy and thought-after-judgement constitutes the reality into which Haidt writes. Emotions, driven by disgust and disrespect, assign a core piece of morality upon which logic can be built. This thought process by which each one of us constructs our worldview--intuition before consideration and the subsequent animosity of the opposition--is what he is looking to battle. In Haidt’s introduction, he states that “[his] hope is that this book will make conversations about morality, politics, and religion more common, more civil, and more fun, even in mixed company” (xii). Instead of creating enemies of straw, Haidt asks his readers to consider them as people. One must fundamentally understand that those they speak with understand reality in a different way that they do, and they must be willing to be compassionate to--and listen to--those whose views are not in line with their own. Climbing deeper into one’s own throats inevitably leads to choking. We must reject our reactive tendencies to silence that which is disagreeable, Haidt says. Instead, we must engage. If we do not, we risk losing that which has made us understand each others’ condition: empathy.

I very much recommend this book for any and all, and would love to hear other thoughts.","Looking back on Jonathan Haidt's prophetic 2012 book, The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion",1605358356

East of Eden

I teach grade 3 and I only ever saw descriptive writing as a means to enrich a text. After East of Eden I appreciate it as a means unto itself. I read page after page of enjoyable description.

I do feel like the characters are a bit binary, born either good or bad. I know that's kinda the point of the book but I think the real world is a bit more complicated than thatm

Anna Karenina - My favourite

I loved Anna Karenina. I loved how Anna was so loved but so simple. I loved how the characters are all different but you can appreciate their point of view and how their upbringing/circumstance made them who they are. Levin's growth was fantastic. 

The Count of Monte Cristo

I enjoyed the philosophy of this book. I liked comparing characters and their response to similar situations. I like the theme of joy and misery only existing in comparison with each other. I like the central message of wait and hope.

I was a bit bored through the central chapters and I found the different names used by characters confusing. I disagreed with the count as an agent of Providence, my personal opinion is that forgiveness is a more meaningful emotional response than revenge.

books,"So here’s the deal.  In the YA section, I feel as if the books are either too juvenile or I’ve already read them.  My all time favorite series is A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J Maas. 
So I’m looking for fantasy books with awesome “book boyfriends” but I do NOT want books that are basically nsfw steamy romance paperbacks. I want actual plot and suspense and lots of angst! 
I am a sucker for angst and whump. I like heroes/heroines in captivity because it adds to the whump. 
Abused characters also! With the significant other finding out about the abuse later and being all shocked/protective/enraged.
Or one character being forced to watch the torture/beating of the one they loved for whatever reason
Transformation by Carol Berg would have been an all time favorite book if the prince had fallen in love with the main character (don’t shame me for saying that😬)
I want plot, but I want to focus on the relationships of all the characters.
Give me pain, sweet whump angst pain

books,"I just finished reading Yevgeny Zamyatin's ""We"" translated by Clarence Brown. He also provided an introduction to the novel which I read BEFORE reading the story. The reason why I want to stress the ""before"" is that he for some reason saw it fit to include a major spoiler to the story in his introduction (which turned out to be true). I won't spoil this twist to those who haven't read the novel, but those who have read it perhaps know what I am talking about (concerning I-330).

I was infurtiated - why should Clarence Brown write such an introduction in which he assumes that the reader is already familiar with the story? Now I am questioning whether in future I should read introductions only after finishing the main story or whether I should read them at all.","Do you read the introductions to books?

I think I remember that there was fairytales written which then the characters came to life from that.
