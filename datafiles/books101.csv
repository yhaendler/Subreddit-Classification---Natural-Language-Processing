books,"There're dozens of threads commenting on how thrilling this book is. I finished it a few minutes ago and I can't say anything more. It's touching, marvelous, and changing in many ways.

But one of the most shocking moments was the conference where dr Nemur revealed that the root of Charlie's condition was phenylketonuria. That's because I know it from my family.

So I decided to share a portion of details about Charlie's disorder. I can't avoid spoilers, so please feel warned.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder, so it is inherited. One person in my family is affected, too. But she wasn't born in the first half of the 20th century like Charlie. When the book was published, there was no mass testing for newly born children, like it has been since the 60s. People with PKU live among us, and have no disabilities due to early detection and keeping a proper diet. My relative has a Master's degree and a well-paid job, and she is an amazing, intelligent person. You would never tell she's affected. Her diet is similar to vegan, but even more restricted (no beans, no nuts, no bread, not so much fries...).

I remember, though, people who were adults and behaving like 3-year-old. Or couldn't remember simple math operations. Those were whose parents haven't kept their diet or thought they can loosen rules. So it is real.

It's a bit bitter that Charlie would not need the surgery if his disorder had been recognized. I know the point of the story wasn't ""being unintelligent hurts"". But from my perspective, I thank God for widespread diagnosing.

I'm curious if more people know about PKU and who read the book differently after learning that fact.",Flower for Algernon is incredible. And there is a deeper story of the Charlie's condition.,1621467296

books,"I‚Äôve been reading less and less the past few years, really feeling my attention span shorten. I thought it was phone habits or mental health stuff, or both. I just couldn‚Äôt read more than a few pages without feeling antsy or tired. 

But I had also noticed that when I‚Äôm crocheting or crossstitching after an hour or so it started to get hard to focus my eyes. So in true underinsured American fashion, waited 2+ years after noticing this to make an eye appointment. 

Welp, turns out I have weirdly powerful eye muscles that have been over compensating for years, probably much longer than I‚Äôve actually been noticing any eye strain, and super need reading glasses. 

So now I can read for hours without feeling distracted/tired/antsy. It was literally totally different the first time I put on my glasses. I‚Äôm back to reading before bed, and plowing through books in the park. 

People with glasses probably already know this as a sign of needing a stonger prescription, but as someone who‚Äôs never needed glasses I didn‚Äôt connect the strain I noticed while crafting with the short attention span reading.

I was under the impression that 11/22/63 is a time traveling book. I love those. Didn't really check out the cover text, because I didn't want spoilers. 
I'm almost halfway through. There were some scary moments, some hints.  I realize the book crosses patches a bit with places and people from ""It"". but it was ok so far.
 the further I get, though, the more I wonder and worry. Is this going to be horror? Is it going to get super scary? I mostly read it at night when everybody else is asleep.

books,"I am an overly attached person, especially when it comes to books. I like to give books the benefit of the doubt and  I'll usually give a book at least 100 pages before I decide to put it down. This time, I only treaded through a mere 50 pages of ""Supermarket"" before having to return it to the library.

I had high expectations for this book, I knew beforehand that it was written by rapper, ' Logic' and so I was looking forward to unique perspectives and style. To me, this book felt like a Wattpad fiction and I couldn't get behind the writing style.

I felt like there was a lot more telling than showing going on. Some of the plot elements didn't make much sense because of this (Flynn punches the owner of the Supermarket and still gets a job in literally a page and a half?). The dialogue and the action elements felt so rushed to me that it was hard to actually visualize what was going on.

I want to give this book another shot because It's been recommended to me a lot and generally the reviews are pretty good.

For some years now I have been a fan of George Perecs literature and his ability to take something mundane and ordinary and turn it into somebething beautiful.

I didn't. Not consciously at least and that was why this book was so fascinating. It takes a good writer to hook you on a topic you never even considered before.

It turns out habit plays an enormous role in our daily life, which I suppose, I could have guessed. Habit drives us and we evolved this way because having to put thought into every little action we perform would be a pointless waste of energy. It might not be so convenient when you're trying to stop binge eating or changing your very unhealthy routine.

Each chapter of the book examines a different side of our automatisms and provides an entertaining real life story ro fo with it, from Febreze marketing strategy to the success behind Alcoholics Anonymous, every last one had me engrossed.

The book is not perfect, as interesting as I found it the prose  gets a little wordy at times. And as much as I enjoyed it, there was no drastic change in my routine I can give it credit for. What I think it did, though, was making me more aware of what pushes me personally and others as well.

So much that after three years after first reading the book, barely a week goes by when there isn't a moment in which I realize there's yet something else I'm not doing because I want to but rather because it sort of just... happens, often,  and maybe I could try and use my time more productively instead.

books,"I've been reading more books from the French Enlightenment, which is roughly from the 1690s up to the 1790s. It is quite interesting. For me, Britain and the United States have many interesting things in this period, but by far I think that the English Renaissance, the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods, have better literature than their descendants. 

Firstly, there was better theater, in particular better tragedy. By the time we get to Queen Anne and the subsequent Hanover kings, you do get some great comedies, but not really any good tragedy since that became something more popular with opera. 

In France, however, you have Diderot, Rousseau, Voltaire, Abbe Prevost,  who wrote the most outrageous things. Think of Diderot's *Les bijoux indiscrets* about a sultan with a magic ring that makes women's vaginas speak. Or perhaps think of Voltaire's wild play, *Mahomet,* which could hardly be performed today. 

In other words, I think the French in 1700s were as edgy as the English had been in the first half of the 1600s. The time of outrage and growing knowledge, the time of Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare, Edmund Spenser, Thomas Middleton, John Donne, Francis Bacon, etc... Back in 2005, when the Barbican produced Marlowe's *Tamburlaine*, they had to abridge some scenes in order to not offend people.

The other workers also go between yelling for him to be thrown out and having sympathy for him. As is stated by the narrator their moods depend on the time of day.  That seems like a very poor way to structure your opinions of someone or to find cause for throwing them out.

The young gingernut kid also seems to be friends with Bartleby at one point but I think even he calls for him to be sacked later on.

Of Mice and Men I found very moving and made a lasting impression where Flowers for Algernon fell flat.

Both address loneliness and makes you think more about what it means to be a person. I liked how hiprocrocy was better addressed in Flowers for Algernon and the drive and insecurities of people. Perhaps is the the progress report style that made the experience less emotional; or that it tried to address too many aspects at once, kept everything at surface level. Psychology, abuse, imposter syndrome, loyalty, hiprocrocy, acceptance etc. are touched on but not nearly as deeply explored as it should have been.

Of Mice and Men felt deeper and made you think and see through the eyes of the characters. A common theme of lonlieness and fear are at the forefront and all the aspects related to it interconnects to feeling needed, validated and driven. How it can change your behavior and personality and how far people can go. It had good foreshadowing and the ending...

Recently I've been nostalgic about the good old days of college and that prompted me to check on Mario Puzo.

He has published 11 novels, one in pseudonym and one finished by his girlfriend. None of books other than The Godfather has garnered any serious talk. Even in Goodreads, where Godfather has 4.36 rating, the others have rating below 4.00.

The experience I remember of reading Godfather is absolute boredom. I couldn't make heads or tales of it: no immediacy, I mean. (I love the movie, by the way.) Then I read The Last Don. Didn't like the prose, but I still remember one shootout scene and the last line where it tells us that everything was puppeteered by the old Don. Then I read Fools Die, which I remember having enormous fun reading, but don't remember anything except someone having sex at his deathbed because that's how he wanted to go. Then I read Omerta. This one I¬†flew through--I¬†had gotten accustomed to Puzo's style--but don't remember anything except the prologue. Then I read The Fourth K. This was my favourite: the president having a negative arc and the assassination in live TV was awesome for my teen self. But I read some reviews and The Fourth K has the worst feedback. 

I realize that the books I've read are crime thrillers and I've grown away from those types of pulpy potboilers and gotten into more Fantasy and literary stuff. So I took a look at some of his books from Amazon previews and I see that only his Fortunate Pilgrim reads like a literary novel.

books,"I've had what im pretty sure is referred to as 'aphantasia' for my entire life. I have never seen or pictured anything in my head. it's always been my eyelids.

I read as much as everyone else here, but I do it quickly. as in - I started the mortal instruments series a week ago today and I just ended the final book. im assuming that's partly because I never stop to visualize, but it makes me sad too. I wanna see what everyone else sees. they get so wrapped up in their stories and to me it's just words with meaning. it's never actually seemed real. I don't like that.

so may I ask if anyone is willing to tell me what it's like to picture these things? its a part of reading I'll never understand so I'm wondering.","As a reader without mental imagery, can someone describe what it's like?",1621441288

I have realised recently that I find it difficult to receive help as an individual and is probably a result of learning to independently take care of my emotions since I was a kid. 

I am currently learning to get out of that cycle because it affects the people I love. I found Helping: How to Offer, Give, and Receive Help by Edgar which I am about to start reading.

books,"What an abrupt ending. 

I really liked a lot of the philosophical thoughts the book presents, but man I have to admit I am a bit disappointed that there wasn‚Äôt much of an ending. I guess that‚Äôs just part of it. 

I also feel like the book makes you discover so much rather than just telling you. Like legit the book just continues on assuming you know what it‚Äôs talking about with terms the author created. Maybe it was just me, but I found myself confused a lot only to realize later what was going on.

Is the fall of Hyperion a continuation of the story? I don‚Äôt want to read too much into it in case there‚Äôs spoilers. I‚Äôm also kind of thinking I‚Äôll just stop the series here- not sure if it‚Äôs worth it to continue on and read the fall of Hyperion.

What would that book be about?

What would heroes and heroines be like?

Who would be the villain and what would be his motives?

Which timlines would be perfect for your taste?

What topics would you like to be represented?

Which sub genre would dominate?

(Question for fantasy lovers) What mythology would you like to see?

And so similar questions.

For example, I wanted to read a book, a love fantasy, set in modern England, where the main character is a wizard from a wealthy family and the villain is a wicked witch who has dangerous connections to the wizarding criminal underworld; and where they fall in love with each other after a while.
