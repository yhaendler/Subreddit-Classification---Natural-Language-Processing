datascience,"Hi

I'm looking some advice on the merits of an accreditation in Microsoft.

I work in a water utility company as a project analyst (responsible for data and reporting on project activities, as part of our Business Improvement team). 

In late 2019 I got permission to do some training/exams but then a bout of illness followed by Covid lockdowns etc stopped that. Now with lockdowns easing, local exam centres might be opening up again. 

So, with that brief context, originally I had looked at the below 4x exams (I think the second two are MCSA) because our work IT are still using Office 2016 so at the time it made sense. 


MOS 2016.  

(1) Exam Ref 77-727 Microsoft Excel,   
(2) Exam Ref 77-728 Microsoft Excel Expert,   

MCSA.  

(3) Exam Ref 70-778 Analysing and Visualising Data with Ms Power BI,    
(4) Exam Ref 70-779 Analysing and Visualising Data with MS Excel,  

They still are, and no immediate plans to upgrade, but I'm wondering if anyone can recommend if this is the right/current pathway to take? 

I'm starting to think long term career-wise that current/future proof (ish) accreditations are the way to go but I'm not sure? 

I use Excel a lot, just started with PBI a year or so ago before Covid, have very, very basic SQL but not every day use. 

Technically my job is a project analyst, which is more about data and reporting on specific project activities rather than wider company data. But I want to secure myself a promotion or at least a more 'data analyst' type role. 

Can anyone advice on what I should look at? 

It'd be helpful for approaching my boss again to ask. I've read that Microsoft have rejigged their accreditations towards pathways rather than products so am a little confused about best place to start. 

I realise that, in terms of experience, it would be fair to say I'm not a data scientist or engineer or anything like that. Our company isn't very good at providing training pathways for certain roles or job titles, so I have to know what it is I want or can do, what I need to help me achieve it and then see how I can get them to cover costs for me etc in order for my performance reviews to take it forward as a career objective. 

Thanks in advance for any discussion on the merits of this.",Accreditations and career in data analytics,1620603547
datascience,"I'm currently working in the accounting department (note: not a CPA or anything close to that) of a non-profit and I'm considering switching over to data science. I've recently admitted to myself that accounting just isn't right for me and that I've stuck with my job mostly because I like what my company does. By switching over to data science though, I still do hope to eventually work in either the non-profit or government sector (although, maybe not necessarily right after I  make this switch). I think that it would be great I do work that examines data to assess the effectiveness of things such as basic income programs or possibly other kinds of social intervention programs.

That said, I need advice on how to make this switch. I'm mainly wondering if I should do grad school or a data science boot camp and need help weighing the pros and cons and picking the right program.

I've only recently started looking into this, so I'll admit that I don't have a long list, but so far, here are the pros and cons I see.

**Grad School**
*Pros*
*Name recognition
*Higher quality education (at least at the more reputable programs)
*Provides a decent amount of theory to build off of that in the long run could contribute to skill development
*Cons*
*Costly
*Time consuming - 1-1.5 years for full-time programs, 2+ years for part-time programs according to my preliminary research
*Academic rigor could be difficult for someone without any kind of STEM background, possibly requiring a lot of self-studying or bridge courses early on
*Cost might require me doing a part-time program and continue my current job, but the academic rigor for it could make it difficult to balance with work

**Boot Camp**
*Pros*
*More affordable
*Less time consuming - most programs seem to be anywhere between 3-6 months. This is rather appealing as I actually would like to leave my current job right away if possible. And if I were to do this full time, I'd feel the hit of having no income for a much shorter period of time than with grad school.
*At least some boot camps have a job-guaranty program attached to it (although, not 100% sure how reliable those are)
*Cons*
*Difficult to assess which boot camp is better than which
*Lower quality training than even undergrad programs - a friend of mine used to work as a tech recruiter and her company's policy for programming jobs was to not even consider those who only did boot camps because they just weren't at the same level as those who studied CS in college
*Because of point mentioned above, even if I land a job after boot camp, career growth might be limited

**Alternative I've ruled out**
Boot strapping - I know that online platforms like Coursera and EdX are great starting points, but they're just that, a starting point. I don't trust myself to have the discipline to just learn from there and find a bunch of projects to develop my skills, so I definitely want some kind of structured curriculum that's supposed to get me ready for a career.

**Alternative I'm considering**
Boot camp, then grad school - considering some of the cons of boot camps, they might not be great for the long term. However, I'm wondering if they do help me get a relatively high-paying job and I get some years of experience under my belt, then would going to grad school be helpful in furthering my career. I might have a leg-up when I apply to school because of the work experience and while I might need still need help with the math and theoretical aspects of the curriculum, I'd hopefully have a relatively easy time with coursework dealing with more applied aspects.

This turned out longer than I was expecting, but I'm hoping that this gives you a good sense of what I'm thinking and what would  be a good path for me to take. Any advice would be appreciated!",Considering career change to data science,1620602567

I've found that the Kaggle forums, communities, and comment sections are not ideal for discussion. As a result, I'm happy to announce that I've created a state-of-the-art Kaggle Discord server to hopefully fix those issues by streamlining competition, dataset, and notebook discussions.

I've reached out to the Kaggle staff to see if an official Discord server could be created, but unfortunately, the staff have too much on their hands. Thus, this server will be unofficial. So you may be thinking, *""aren't there a bunch of these inactive Discord servers floating around?""* While that is true, we have over 480 people and counting with people asking questions. Let me just give you a quick rundown of some of the features I've added to this server:

* Unique roles or ranks like expert or novice with the same color of Kaggle
* Verified people from Kaggle sharing codes from Kaggle to help answer questions
* Resource, dataset, and notebook showcasing channels with people sharing
* Team formation and discussion channels for competitions
* Channels for computing topics, similar to the Communities tab here on Kaggle

I've spent quite a long time setting this server up in hopes that a decent proportion of the Kaggle community will join and find it useful. The server will only be successful if the first people who join it are active and stay, so please do consider joining and sharing it with your friends and any other Kagglers you may know.

datascience," It seems to me like synthetic images is the way forward for training computer vision AI models.

It has the following advantages:

1. No physical limitations. Some images in real life can be very expensive or even impossible to obtain in large amounts, like car crashes. Synthetic images however are only limited to the skill of the 3D artist.
2. Less manpower intensive. Physical images need to be obtained and then annotated. Synthetic images can be generated in bulk easily, and the annotation process is automatic.
3. A larger variety and less bias. Synthetic images can be used to generate scenarios that are not commonly seen, or thought of.
4. Accuracy. Annotations done by a human, especially segmentations would not be as accurate as synthetic images. Synthetic images would generally be able to label almost every pixel accurately, since the developer knows where the 3d model is in the space of the image.

However, some people associate synthetic images to be unsuitable as a substitute for real images because they believe the quality is lacking in terms of realism.

datascience,"Hey folks,

I'm in the process of building a fashion aggregation website as a portfolio piece. To obtain the data for this site, I have multiple scrapers for many of the largest fashion retailers in North America. 

To describe the data - one product can have many variants. e.g, 'Summer Dress' that comes in 3 colours and 8 sizes.  As such this product would have 24 variant products, the generic being the 'parent' product. Each variant may have different pricing, availability, sizing, colour etc.

My question concerns table construction - my scrapers output every variant of every product with their associated data, which can be in CSV or pandas DataFrame format. Can any of you tell me how I would go about populating two database tables from this data:

1. Table with the parent product, with foreign keys to each of its variants

2. All variant products of a parent product, linked to that product such that on my eventual website, they can all be found through searching the foreign keys of the parent product. 

I hope that makes sense, in a bit of a jam here. I'm not sure what to Google - even if you can't provide an answer, any points on even what to research would be of great help.

I'm a math major who's interested in data science and working with computers in general. I've been looking at online resources and don't really know how to best learn about this area. I've got a couple questions for you guys.

Is taking a Data Structures and Algorithms course (like Tim Roughgarden's) enough to start doing Leetcode to an acceptable level?

In addition to all of that, would doing courses and competitions on Kaggle be useful for getting a DS position? Is it recommended to upload projects after competitions to GitHub to show employers?

Apologies in advance if I'm breaking any rules or if this is more suited to the weekly thread. 

I've been working as a Data Analyst for a healthcare company for the past year. A lot of my work surrounds creating queries to track certain metrics then building dashboards to create insights using visualization tools. 

I do like the field, but unsure of where to move next. I do enjoy the coding aspect of my position (Lots of SQL, don't like excel as much), as well as hacking away at a problem and figuring out how to fix certain issues with the code we have. 

However, I hate coming up with insights and solutions. I don't mind creating the dashboards, but I don't like the proactive and analytical work that comes with it. ""Oh that's a good find, maybe we should look into this next"". I enjoy more when there's a problem to fix, then I fix that problem.

Hello,

Hope you all are doing well. This is my first post on here:)

I am a currently a 1st year undergraduate in Financial Modelling**\*** and I plan on doing something related to the Data Analysis/Science industry in the future (in the Finance/Generalist stream).

To be completely honest, I am not great at programming. However, I find myself doing better and actually interested in my Finance/Applied Math/Stats (less intensive programming) courses. I prepared a list of questions because I really need help on future opportunities/job prospects.

**\*This field is different from regular Finance, it incorporates more Applied Math/Statistical programming/Financial theory courses.**

**Questions:**

1. What is the fastest growing 'specialty field' in Data Science (I feel like this is just a buzz word for CS + Stats).
2. Which qualifications and skills do employers really look for (which degree and what type of degree -Honors/Major/Masters)?
3. What programs can I do apart from Data Science/Computer Science/Stats that would still be relevant to Data Analytics/Science?

**Side note:** I apologize if all this info seems out of place and I sound dumb. I lack a lot of knowledge in this field.

datascience,"I have a dataset of daily news compilations that are sorted by relevance for each day. I am trying to build a model will predict ""relevance"" of an article. In other words, given headline, body, and other metadata, I want to spit out scores that allow me to automatically rank these articles as well as filter out irrelevant news. 

My general idea is that each day should basically be viewed as a batch: models should be learning from relative rankings within a day, but not between days because there is no guarantee the first article from one day is more relevant than the third article from the next day. Just training globally on rankings - think multi-class where the response classes are rankings - would not preserve this fact and might lead to bad results.  

This seems like a learning-to-rank task. However, had two questions about the two main LTR models - LGBM (which uses boosting with LambdaRank objective) and Tensorflow Ranking (which uses NNs plus one of their [objective functions](https://github.com/tensorflow/ranking/blob/d8c2e2e64a92923f1448cf5302c92a80bb469a20/tensorflow_ranking/python/losses.py#L35)):

1. How does LGBM approach groups? I've tried reading through the original [paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lambdarank.pdf)  and [documentation](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pythonapi/lightgbm.LGBMRanker.html), but still can't totally wrap my head around it. Is is like what I said where groups/queries are all treated independently and no assumptions are made about relative rankings between groups/queries? Thus far, I've gotten pretty poor performance out of of LGBM.Ranking model, but admittedly I'm using bag of words. I could try and feed embeddings into the model, but it seems TensorFlow Ranking is better at that which leads to my second question...  
2.  Can you use TensorFlow Ranking without contextual information? In theory, I can feed each date in as a ""context,"" I suppose such as by making dates unique ids or categoricals. But will TFR then make a bunch of mini models specific to each date and not a good global model? Obviously, I don't really care about which article is specifically relevant for October 15, 2016 because I will never again be getting articles for that day. Will TFR be able to learn that the context information I'm feeding in is useless. Concretely, I imagine the model learning that the weights for the contextual input should be zero, but I don't know in practice if this is the case. 

I know what I'm asking is a bit contradictory. I want to train only on relative rankings inside a group (which I'm not sure LGBM satisfies) yet I'm aiming for a single global model that doesn't actually depend on the group (which I'm not sure TFR satisfies). Obviously, a bit of this can be resolved by empirically testing performance, but I figured having a better theoretical understanding of how grouping/context works with these two models would be better in the long run for the model and my own personal understanding.
