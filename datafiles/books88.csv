books,"It seems like one thing many people (totally reasonably) want from their authors is a certain amount of predictability: like, when you buy the new book by author X, you know more or less the *kind* of thing you're getting. It makes it easier to know whether you really want to get the author's new book when it comes out if you know it's going to have a family resemblance to their last book. 

Like Jane Austen; when you pick up a novel by Jane Austen you pretty much already know the protagonist is going to be a strong-willed and intelligent woman, and you’re expecting a sharp and witty writing style. Or take Salman Rushdie—the next Rushdie novel is almost for sure going to be a big, sprawling, ambitious story of cultures in collision with one another, quite possibly involving magic realism, the sentences long and packed with wide-ranging allusions and wordplay. If you’re starting into a Flannery O’Connor story you can bet someone’s going to be damned or saved. Chaim Potok for his part, basically wrote the same novel over and over again, nearly every one of them featuring a young Jewish protagonist trying to balance the needs of the individual against the needs of the community. Edward P. Jones sticks to the Washington, DC, area, while William Faulkner couldn’t get out of Yoknapatawpha. And people come back to these folks again and again to get more of that same good stuff.

But I have to say that I'm a big fan of UNpredictable authors. I'm thinking of, for example, Kazuo Ishiguro, or Mat Johnson, or Jennifer Egan—these folks take huge leaps in unexpected directions from one book to the next. But above all I'm thinking of Stewart O'Nan. O’Nan writes short stories, including a collection (In the Walled City) and a novel-in-stories (Everyday People), but he’s also written a towering stack of novels-not-in-stories. He writes historical fiction—the US home front during World War II (A World Away), the wake of the American Civil War (A Prayer for the Dying), or the battle over British Palestine in 1945 (City of Secrets). At the same time, he writes fiction solidly rooted in the present (e.g., Emily Alone or Last Night at the Lobster). He writes in first person, third, second. His protagonists are a priest (A Prayer for the Dying), a serial killer jacked up on amphetamines (The Speed Queen), a trio of ghosts out for revenge (The Night Country). He writes about war, about a plague, about a woman quietly navigating old age, about managing a Red Lobster on the last night before it shuts down. And it's all *really good.* What’s O’Nan’s next novel going to be about? I have no idea. But I do know that I’m going to love it. And I'm going to love his willingness to try new things.

books,"Books are one of the greatest joys in my life. They have been my adventures, my personality shapers, and my other tier of existence. When I decided to become a parent, I knew I would be bringing a child into two worlds. It is a common enough thing. Readers have babies every day. I don’t think that makes the experience any less amazing. My child came to know that if you ask Mom for hug she will always say yes and if you give a mouse a cookie he’s going to ask you for a glass of milk. If you touch a hot stove you could get burned, but if you walk into a wardrobe you could end up where it is always winter and never Christmas. He got taller and the books got thicker. I worried about finding stories that will keep his interest, keep him coming back to my other world. Thank goodness I found your books. I’ve read them along with him and spent many an afternoon discussing dragon politics over cocoa. He has learned that many points of view bring about better decisions and that we are never limited by what people tell us we have to be. Just as importantly, he has lived where the stars are mirrored in silver scales and rainforest trees hide living rainbows. Thank you, Tui T.

books,"The relationship between Edmond and Mercedes was bound to fail. Edmond would never be fleiz with her because of the painful memories of the past, her future was with Haydee with whom he would be happy.

The 1934 and 2002 films are very superficial in that. Both films fail to show a man who has been imprisoned for years and suffered,

When you read Kolyma Tales by Varlam Shalamov and Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, you see people who are embittered to live the hell on earth.

Edmond never forgives Mercedes for marrying Mondego and stays with another woman.

Solzhenitsyn abandoned his first wife, who married while he was in prison to married another woman.

Aleksander Solzhenitsyn was married to Natalya Alekseevna Reshetovskaya, when he went to the gulag, she divorced him after he was released.

She marries Vsevolod Sergeevich Somov.

After his release, Solzhenitsyn was sent into exile to a settlement (the village of Berlik, Kokterek district, Dzhambul region, southern Kazakhstan). He worked as a math and physics teacher from 8th to 10th grade at the local high school by the name of Kirov.

In June 1956, by decision of the Supreme Court of the USSR, Solzhenitsyn was released without rehabilitation for the absence of a body of crime in his actions.

In October 1956, she visited her ex-husband in the Vladimir region, Torfoprodukt station, where he was a teacher at the time. . In 1957, Solzhenitsyn moved to Ryazan, and in the same year they remarried.

But the relationship was never the same, there was bitterness in him towards her, he did not forget that he was abandoned by her and that she married another while he was in prison.

Later, the two admit that they made the mistake of trying to enter the same river a second time.

Natalia devoted herself entirely to her husband. She helped him diligently in everything, fulfilled all his wishes. But his he was getting more and more distant from her.

He later ended up meeting Natalia Dmitrievna Solzhenitsyna (Svetlova) whom he married a second time. And she was 20 years younger than him.

Solzhenitsyn's first wife attempted suicide and yet he divorced her to marry his second wife. 

Only in Hollywood fairy tales for Edmond to forgive Mercedes and the two of them to have a happy new relationship.

Dumas was brilliant when he got haydee.

The Soviet version of 1988 was sensational and showed a protagonist who seems to have been in a communist gulag and suffered. Edmond in this mostoru film realistically that has bitterness with his ex-fiancee.

books,"At first I thought it was the opposite way around, but the first Expanse book (Leviathan Wakes) was published in 2011 and Children of Time was published in 2015.

The writing styles are similar as well as the premise of something trying to infect another species in order to transform it. Characters named Holsten/Holden. In terms of worldbuilding, Children of Time could take easily take place in the same universe as Leviathan Wakes, in the distant future. 

Overall, I don't think either book is great. Leviathan Wakes was dull; I didn't like that the mystery of missing girl was basically a MacGuffin; I had trouble telling Holden and Miller apart. 

Children of Time is slightly less dull but the characters aren't interesting and it's not clear where the plot is going. Sometimes I say that as a compliment because it means the plot is unpredictable, but in this case it's a criticism - the book is neither character nor plot driven. It's not driven at all.

I'm of course familiar with Hollywood's portrayals of exorcisms as fodder for horror films, and tend to believe evil spirit creatures do exist, but if Malachi Martin's book is truly what he presented it to be - a real accounting of his personal experiences, then Hollywood has, possibly for the first time, under-sensationalized reality.

I know some critics believed Martin had fictionalized his experiences or outright lied, but is anyone aware of any effort being made to uncover the identities of the persons portrayed in this book?  Although he obscures details to protect their privacy, I'm surprised no one has ever come forward, especially given the questions raised over the years about the book's voracity.
