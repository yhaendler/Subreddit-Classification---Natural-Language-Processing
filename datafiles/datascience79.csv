datascience,"A week ago, I typed in a post fuming about people who'd type stuff into optional text fields that wasted my time.  Some of this text was actual phrases like ""No comment"", and others were just random keyboard smashes like ""asdf asdf"".  I got LOTS of responses, roughly grouped into:

1) ""Easy -- just write a regex for it!""   This isn't a complete solution, as people just keep coming up with new tweaks, like ""asdf asDf asdF"" instead, or ""No comment at this time"".

2) ""Easy -- just do dictionary lookups!""  This isn't a complete solution either, as any special domain -- medicine is the one I'm working in -- has lots of words that don't appear in dictionaries, like drug names, obscure acronyms, and abbreviations.

3) ""Suck it up, it's called work for a reason. ""  Excuse me, Polyanna, griping about work is kind of a thing on the internet.

I put some thought into your responses, and thought I could do better.  Here's what my solution looks like:

1) Parse the complete set of data, drop it to lower case, and strip the punctuation and white space, and create a dictionary of unique words.   For each word, decide if it's in the regular dictionary, a dictionary of domain terms I keep as a csv, and count the frequency of occurrence. 

2) For each comment, 

   a) Clean it up,

  b) If it matches any of the known ""throwaway"" phrases, like ""No comment at this time"", score it as 100%

c) Else, go through the words, and count it as a 'good word' if it's in the dictionary, the special vocabulary file, or....it occurs a lot.   I've counted it fully as a 'good word' if it's in the corpus 10 times, as 0.75 of a good word if it's in there 5 times, etc.    This works great if the project is in a domain I haven't done before.

d) Score the comment as percentage of bad words to good words.

3) Write the sorted scored list to a file to examine later.  There may be a few bits you'll need to reclassify, but I'd say my accuracy is getting close to 100%

4) Write a list of previously unknown, but frequently occurring, words to a file to consider transferring to the dictionary of domain terms.

Thanks for (most) of your comments.  This worked out pretty well.   Dictionary lookup was not as slow as I'd figured.  The total solution was about a hundred lines of R.",Son of 'I hate people who type asdf asdf into comment fields' -- I built a better solution,1611961376
datascience,"Hi all!  


As the title says, I'm currently attending a data science course while having a marketing background. I studied marketing management in university - or rather, I'm about to graduate. I've made this choice after attending a seminar about big data in businesses, after which I've been fascinated by the possibilities of data science as a discipline as a whole.   


While I'm already enthusiast about it, I see that many data scientists took engineering/statistic/computing studies. I'm clearly taking this path wanting to be competent, not considering it as a second-best.   


I took statistic exams and I'm pretty confident with maths. The course I'm taking is organized in three moduls: Python, Data Visualization and Machine Learning, with numerous practical projects and personalized feedbacks. I'm studying SQL as well. 

I'm pretty sure it's not bullshit for various reasons, first of all because the company that gives the course has a very good reputation in my country. Also, a professor of mine told me to go for it.

The job not only looked good because of the tasks, but also because the product/service offered by this company is specially interesting for me, and is something I am passionate about. So, I decided to go for it, big time. 

After 2 screenings, one pure HHRR and another semi technical, I was invited for the \*big\* technical case round. As I am also working full time and I wanted to make it perfect, I took 1 week off to prepare the case. I applied all I know, and more, I really put a lot of effort and went the extra mile in every detail. Then, the interview/presentation took place. 2:30 hrs. with 4 interviewers. The presentation was perfect, not only the best I have ever done, but also the best I have seen -I also interviewed people since the early 2000s, and I've seen it all. 20 minutes after the presentation, the leading person -my potential future boss- called me to congratulate me for the outcome and confirm I was going to have the last round ASAP. 

For the last round I spent my whole holidays preparing everything I could think of, and also understanding the profiles of the people I was going to talk to. The last round was a series of more informal chats with top management profiles, all of them went perfectly, good vibes, nice chats, and I was able to cast some light over challenges they face in their business and propose how to tackle them. 

Again, soon my potential future boss called me and let me know that everything went perfect and that I should expect news very soon. We also discussed when I could join, home office situation, the profiles of my potential team, etc... 

And that's it. 

\+8 weeks passed, I never got any further feedback of any kind. After 1 week I sent a short email, nothing. 2 weeks later, a second one, CCing the HHRR partner involved. Nothing. At some point 2-3 weeks later sent a last short email, and nothing. Complete silence. Nothing. I just stopped trying.

In Engineering it's somewhat well defined/accepted across big tech companies that there exists two paths one could follow: management or individual contribution. Nomenclature will vary from company to company, but usually the IC  track will see titles like ""Staff"" or ""Principal"" to denote people on the tech track that would be the equivalent to ""Managers"" or ""Directors"" in the management track.

That being said, Engineering seems to me as a somewhat easier to define realm, maybe because the deliverables are easier to measure whereas data science often includes the process of analyzing a problem, cleaning data, applying statistical methods, building ETL pipelines,  productionizing/measuring models and sharing insights -- which aren't really easy to bin as easily. 

The more I tried to reason about the Engineering tech track, the more it seemed to me that those foundational work they were doing would be more similar to research in data science instead - which would include but not be limited to Machine Learning, Data Warehousing and Stats applied research.

datascience,"Hello everyone,

I have been thinking a lot about this. Right now I'm working as DS (IT background), but what I have always liked is the environment and the animals. At the end, my purpose is to dedicate my knowledge in IT (such as working with gps data and maps in python, apart from DS tools) to protect, help and defend the environment. I am trying to be as realistic as possible: I don't think I will find a private company dedicated to this topic (maybe a public institution). Do you think there are ways to work in this topic, in a job or even by doing a phd (not sure about this, any advice would be great)?

And then the COO interview, it was the weirdest of them all, a guy asking about my hobbies and uninteresting stuff about my life for about 45 minutes, I gave my best effort regardless.

I'm a freshman in my second semester. My major is undecided and so far the classes I've taken mirror either DS or actuarial sciences. So I am a bit torn.

I'd say I'm good at statistics, modeling (whatever a freshman can get a hold off anyways), research, good at grasping and learning fairly quickly. Not the greatest at pure mathematics, things like multivariable calculus. I love looking at trends/ models/ charts and trying to make conclusions based on them. I'm great with numbers.

I do not have a lot of programming experience, but I plan to learn for the sake of it and get some certifications one way or another instead of getting a minor. I did take an intro to java course, but it was a lot of collaboration than actually the material itself, so I am not really well-versed in Java.

This semester I am starting a research project with a mentor who is the director of the Predictive Analytics Center at my university- but I have an old project from another professor that he recently emailed me about this December to get me started on it.

This old project is bioinformatics modeling. It uses math and protein data to iterate over some hand written models to determine.... something... I'm not even sure. I have just done programming grunt work so far.

However I really want out of this latter project. The stuff he is asking me to do is difficult and it seems like it would be easier for him to do it himself. ( I don't know if its normal in the workplace to pass off projects between people... but the program is kind of a mess and I can only access it on a virtual machine using Firefox so its really a chore).
