datascience,"I know, it’s scary. 

I remember job hunting and getting into kaggle to build my portfolio: inspecting kernels, recreating code, adding new pieces. It wasn’t until I came across kernels with insane coding. My heart sank, “I guess I’m not good enough.”

If you’ve ever felt like this, let me share some advice: it’s all good. 

My portfolio, to this day, is still not an elite level. My kaggle account? Forget it. The value is in your work, and how much you respect it. No matter where you go, if you believe in your job, complete a project, and admire your hard efforts, it’s worth more than any amazing kernel. 

But what if you’re not there yet? Well, building a portfolio does help, and so does practicing. Here’s the catch: kaggle is geared towards the 10% of what a data scientist will spend their time on, and by that point, you won’t need a complex model — well, that or the solution has specific constraints. 

I can tell you now, 80% of my work at my current job is simple and effective and I only get simpler. I spend more time finding more effective ways to work and understand my data to deliver easy solutions. on the plus side, they work really well! 

The next time you look at a kaggle kernel and feel overwhelmed. If your goal is to work in industry, then kaggle does not reflect this entirely. 

Additionally, as you spend most days doing the job you love, things will eventually click. I know it sounds a bit esoteric, but trust me... you’ll feel a sense of comfort with the difficulty of problems. By this point, your portfolio writes itself. 

If your goal is to become a kaggle master, you’re probably the one submitting these incredible kernels, you smart genius you! 

Keep pushing! And always remember: life is hard, why make it more complex when easy works just fine!

datascience,"Hello, I am a software engineer with a Bachelors in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics and about 1 year of work experience as a Data Engineer writing really simple ETL pipelines. I am interested in Data Science because i have always found math and statistics to be some of my favorite classes, and machine learning is very interesting to me.

So i started trying to learn Data science and i was wondering if you guys could take a look at what ive learned so far, and give me pointers, and answer some questions i had about my journey.

&amp;#x200B;

Courses I have used for study: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Python for Data Science and Machine Learning (Udemy) - Jose Portilla

\-NLP with Python (Udemy) -Jose Portilla

\- Stanford Machine learning  (Coursera)- Andrew NG

\- The Ultimate Hands-On Hadoop (udemy) -Frank Kane

\-Tableau 2020 A-Z (Udemy) -Kirill Eremenko

And i have read through an Introduction to Statistical Learning to reinforce the concepts i learned. 

&amp;#x200B;

So i have some questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1)  Do you think I would need to go back for my Masters or PH.D. Would you strongly suggest it? Or should i just keep applying for Junior Data Science positions until i get my foot in the door and go from there?

2) Where should i take my learning next? is there a topic im missing? Or should i be focusing in and reinforcing what I already have?

3) Ive been noticing that a lot of practical application of the machine learning topics are really abstracted. How important is deeply understanding the theory when the application is reduced to  only a few lines of code? How deep would you bother going on some of these topics before it becomes a waste of time?

4) given that Im a programmer, how in depth should i be going into Data Analytics skills? It seems to me like a Data Scientist is some mix of a Data Analyst and a Data Engineer. And my Engineering skills are most likely already on par with what they need to be. 

5) I want to start using Kaggle to practice, but i have no idea where to start (dont tell me the titanic one, ive done those easier classification  and linear regression problems.)

This post might get long, really sorry for that. I am currently an Undergrad student in his third year double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. As the data science/analyst field is quite ambiguous, it's getting very difficult for me to figure out any career path. For eg. I always feel that I need to know something more to apply anywhere OR I find various job postings/internships with the same name BUT with a HUGE variety of pre-requisites/skills.

Honestly, this is making me quite mad and I am completely lost as to what I need to do now. I am not sure if this is the best way to go about it but my life cant seem to move anymore. So, below I have tried to put out a complete list of what I have majorly learnt at my university, course-wise. This list is obviously not exhaustive but I tried to include most of the seemingly important stuff.

So, I want to know what should I learn more before applying for internships (preferable role Data analyst)? Did I even learn anything significant? What kind of roles do I seem to be eligible for?

For the data analyst role, how should I begin? I have applied to many places (around 50) and haven't had a great experience with that. Is ""contacting nearby startups and asking for analyzing their data just for learning"" a viable strategy to break in the field?

I don't have a lot of experience writing blog posts, so I would like to bounce it off you good people here, before I start posting on my own website. Feedback very much appreciated:


**Things to consider when negotiating a contract for a data science project**

When you are facing your first data science project and the accompanying negotiation of a project contract, it can be a little bit overwhelming and it's easy to forget to pen down some important issues.  In this article I will provide a list of some of these issues that should be defined in a data science project contract - and a few things that should not.

**Form and Content of the Result**

To manage expectations on the client's side, define the deliverables precisely, such as 

**the goal, e.g.**  

* identify factors on the website that influence the average shopping cart volume
* decide if the any of the 5 marketing campaigns of last year had a measurable impact on the revenue and if so, how much
* analyze if the customer retention measures in the call center are generating positive returns
* ...

**the format, e.g.**

* Powerpoint
* Word
* notebook
* Airflow workflow
* key-ready application
* daily mail reports
* ...


**the content, e.g.**

* one off analysis
* model for continuous evaluation
* table or visualization
* the timeframe of data to be analyzed and - if applicable - the timeframes for forecasts
* ...

**the timing**

* a.k.a. the deadline

**Wrangling the input data**

This is one of the trickiest ones, because part of why you are negotiating a data science project right now might be that your client does not have a very good overview over his own data landscape. Doctors can't blame their patients for being sick. But to the extent of your client's knowledge do define the rough size and shape of the data provided to you and their accessibility:

* millions of rows
* GB size
* remote access or on site only
* DB/DWH downtimes
* ETL processes blocking you from access (my last project DWH was down for one hour after lunch break for ETL)
* ...

Also include in your contract a passage that allows you to re-negotiate or get out of the contract after having an in-depth look at the data, as there are many potential, unforeseeable hiccups along the way that are neither your fault, nor your contract partner's. 


**You will be paid for your time, not the impact of your results**

There is no guarantee that you will find any result of substance and economical impact in an exploratory data science project. If you want to explore which factors influence the shopping cart value of a customer, it is entirely possible that the input data set does not contain any answers to your question. Any impactful factors that you happen to identify might already be at their optimum or cannot be adjusted for reasons outside the scope of your analysis. Mention in your contract that you do not owe any specific result and that your compensation is for the time and effort of the process, not the efficacy of your results. 



**Do not present preliminary results, avoid presenting your results many times over**

Do not agree on presenting intermediate results without giving great thought to it. Preparing a shiny presentation to placate a sceptical customer after a week or two of work will take focus away from your final result. Preparing the presentation of the result can take between 30 - 50 % of the overall man hours of a project, so if you want to present results after two weeks, you will barely have a week to do the actual work, if at all. Also, this can backfire if you decide to pursue a different angle to solve a problem after presenting preliminary results on a different route.

Oftentimes, the client simply wants to be kept in the loop to avoid wasting the money they invest in you. You can offer to communicate regular status updates via Email or chat and you should keep those memos neutral in terms of results to avoid eating your words later, e.g. write ""Explored - among other variables - the customers age in relation to the revenue"" instead of ""Looks like older customers spend more money in your shop"".

Once you find interesting results worthy of presentation, there might be a cascade of ""oh, the Head of Marketing needs to see that"", ""oh, the COO needs to see that"", ""oh, the CEO needs to see that"". This, of course, means for you that you will be spending more time than expected on the project, because you do not present the results once but 3 or 4 times. Stating in your contract that the results will be presented once and once only will give you leverage, should the client ask you to do more than one presentation or discussion of the results. 

**Access to subject matter experts**

While I suggest keeping the C-Level stakeholders on a ""need to know""-basis, I do recommend to keep in close contact with the client's side subject matter experts, as you will have questions that need answers. Everyone needs a vacation once in a while, but it is most inconvenient if your contacts within the client's organization are taking that long overdue holiday in the middle of your project. So, make sure you know when they will be present and that they are not constantly beleagured with meetings or vacations, but will actually be available to discuss your ideas and findings. 


**Hardware provided or BYOD**

If your client is providing you with hardware and you don't bring your own device, make sure it's fast and has sufficient RAM. The minimum nowadays should be 16 GB RAM for batch processing of any significant amount of data. Of course the price of RAM is minute compared to the overall budget of the average project and enough RAM to avoid swapping to disk can save you hours if not days over the course of a larger project.


**Third Party Tools**

If you want to rely on a 3rd party tools - especially when data is uploaded to their servers - make sure you are allowed to do so and it's within the infosec guidelines of your client.

**Minimize PII**

If anyhow possible, do not accept any personally identifiable information. You don't want to be involved if, at any point, there is a data breach and customer information get's leaked. You cannot leak or lose what you do not have.


**Checklist**

* Form and content of the final result is defined
* Document size, shape, and scope of data that will be provided to you
* Add a disclaimer about the exploratory nature of the data science project if applicable
* Define a predetermined breaking point after initial look into the data 
* Not agreed on any preliminary result meetings
* How many times the results will be presented 
* Your compensation for your efforts is defined
* Which hardware will be provided (if applicable) is defined
* Define which third party tools you want to use and get them signed off by infosec
* Define which PII is excluded from the data provided to you

Lately, because of the lockdown, I started learning ML through Coursera and begun participating in Kaggle competitions. Although my learning is highly unorganized as I'm self-learning, I thoroughly enjoy learning ML, and I find it very interesting. Because of my interest in phy and research, I'm looking for summer projects, but I'm not finding any opportunities where I can apply my new skills. It's causing me to second guess my decision to start learning this and is making me wonder if it's too early and if I should focus on the physics projects before I can do any ML. I enjoy learning all these new things, and it feels like I've discovered a new interest apart from physics, so I don't want to let go of it either. So I wanted to know what was the right thing to do, should I stop learning ML for now or is there still somewhere I can use my skills at this stage?

I'm working with a hobby project on ML, and after collecting the data  and cleaning, I'm now doing to the task of applying some ML algorithms to it.

datascience,"When you apply for a job and get rejected, that’s normally the end of the story.

And in fact for most jobs, this doesn’t seem like the end of the world. You might have liked the product and the team culture, but hey, plenty of fish in the sea.

But if you *really* want to work somewhere and the opportunity doesn’t work out, then that can sting.

That’s where Jason comes in.

In the summer of 2017, [Jason Yuan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonyuandesign/) was rejected from an Apple Music design internship. He referred to it as an opportunity of a lifetime, that, well he had missed out on.

But what Jason did next is pretty awesome. He spent the next three months pursuing his own project focused on redesigning the Apple Music experience.

He reframed the rejection as an opportunity to get better at his craft. In his [case study](https://medium.com/startup-grind/i-got-rejected-by-apple-music-so-i-redesigned-it-b7e2e4dc64bf) that went viral, Jason walks us through what he’d change about Apple Music, how he’d make it better, and other potential ideas he has for the platform.

It’s a remarkable piece of work. It shows that Jason is focused on the process - he’s willing to put his work out there and get better.

His whole experience conveys three concepts that I want to discuss:

**Concept #1: High Agency**

When most people are told they can’t do something, that’s the end of the dialogue. They outsource their decision making to other people.

People with high agency don’t let this happen. A second dialogue starts in their mind - how do I get around this obstacle?

This is a concept I first heard about from [Eric Weinstein](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein). Steve Jobs has a similar concept which he referred to as the Reality Distortion Field. An example:

In 1981, Bud Tribble, one of the key employees on the original Mac computer, greeted a new software engineer at Apple by telling him they were scheduled to ship the Macintosh software in just ten months.

The new employee, Andy Hertzfeld, told him this was impossible. Tribble agreed.

But Jobs wouldn’t take no for an answer. Tribble described this as follows:

*“In Jobs’s presence, reality is malleable. He can convince anyone of practically anything. It wears off when he’s not around, but it makes it hard to have realistic schedules.”*

Jason is a prime example of a high agency person. Although he didn’t get the internship, he realized that the opportunity to learn more about UX design was entirely up to him.

He didn’t need permission to do what he did. All he needed to put in was the time and effort.

Jason was rejected for the internship in the Summer of 2017. He published his Apple Music UX Case Study around then.

Can you guess where he interned the Summer of 2018? Apple.

That’s right - Jason’s case study basically made hiring him one year later a no brainer. He got rejected the summer before and there’s where the story *should* have ended. But his resourcefulness made sure that wasn’t the case.

**Concept #2: Learn In Public**

Most people think they need to be *experts* before publishing any of their work online.

But when Jason published his Apple case study, he made it very clear that he wasn’t coming from a place of expertise.

In fact, Jason’s alma mater Northwestern University didn’t even have a formal graphic design program, so Jason is all self-taught.

This [article](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) makes a similar claim. Don’t worry about being wrong because you’re likely in a position where you’re pushing yourself and growing. If you are wrong, the internet will correct you and you’ll end up learning new things.

Writing your thoughts out also forces you to be crystal clear and contributes to solidifying your learnings. In a world that’s going increasingly remote, writing well is a valuable skill to have and one that can make you stand out.

Finally, learning in public also allows one to attract mentors. Not many people share their work in public. It makes you stand out and people who are already higher up in their career start wanting to help you.

In Jason’s case, by documenting his work, he was able to get the Apple internship.

And let’s assume for a moment that he didn’t get the internship. Even then, his case study went viral - it was widely shared on social media and he got thousands of people checking his work out.

Only good things could have happened. If not Apple, Jason would still have eventually ended up with an awesome opportunity popping up.

**Concept #3: Spite**

Jason prefaces his case study by clearly stating that his work was not driven by indignation or spite. In other words, he states that he didn’t put all this work into redesigning Apple Music because they rejected him.

That’s fair. It’s definitely the healthy mindset. But I want to explore the alternative view as well.

Let’s assume that *he did* do this out of spite.

I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing. Proving people wrong can be a huge force of motivation.

Danielle Leong, an Engineering Manager at Github, talks about this in her [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tsunamino/status/1287422357305352193). If you’ve been told that you’re not good enough at something, instead of complaining you can get better.

Everyone loves an underdog. When Apple rejects you and you come back by writing a 3000 word case study that goes viral on the internet, you’ve completely flipped the script.

There’s actually a bit of [research](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=811029101084126111095105108018093027053076059068029030090099088099024086089119004075018124107061016122018112083097115006126091117071001040021121010122007065006074034035056125111122098123089065096000126004064118068125094121005124077086114076019025000&amp;EXT=pdf) that has been done related to this investigating the reason behind why certain individuals become entrepreneurs.

The paper finds that individuals with *actual* ability that exceeds the *signal* value of their ability (say, their credentials or whatever they can put on a resume) become entrepreneurs.

Steve Jobs was rejected from HP because he lacked a degree. He went on to start Apple.

Jan Koum was rejected by Twitter and Facebook. He went on to start Whatsapp..which he sold to Facebook for $19 billion.

Jason Yuan was rejected from Apple. So he wrote a case study that went viral and the rest is history.

Hello, there! I'm a MSc Psychology student from Brazil :)

&amp;#x200B;

I have 4+ years of research within psychology, having published some quant articles in this. I'm currently transitioning to Data Science/Analytics, aiming to start my job search in jan/fev 2021, since I have a scholarship and can use this time to study/learn/specialize myself.

**Currently, I've been wondering: do people from non-tech/math heavy fields actually ""make it"" in this industry?**

By ""make it"", I'm implying ""have a job and career prospects"".

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've read in books/blog posts &amp; heard through videos/podcasts, most people in Data Science and analytics *claim that they've transitioned to this field*. The catch for me is that most, if not all, have background in Engineering, CS, Physics, etc. That to me is strange since these subjects have a ton of math material and a great part of analytics &amp; data science is math / statistics.

I'd like to hear new stories to get my hopes up again, I guess. I've not had any tech or math related classes through my college years, and sometimes that's something I find myself worried about.

Also, I'd like to get a better grasp at different career paths you might have had if you came from non-tech backgrounds.

My career goal is to become a Data Scientist facing toward production, and would like to engage more in programming on the side of machine learning engineering.

1. Physics Ph.D., with good mathematical skills and coding experience (but I have to say my coding skill is not that strong compared to CS people) 
2. My previous job required a very broad knowledge of machine learning, so I have a rather good knowledge of machine learning algorithms and deep learning knowledge (I took Coursera courses, Udacity nano degree, and read books, paper). But the problem is I still lack the industry project experience and deep-dive problem-solving/engineering experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

My learning target is quite clear: improve my coding skill and learn more about MLOps (Big Data, model development and model deployment). But **my biggest concern is how to do high-quality DS/ML projects to strengthen those skills (and have nice project experience in my resume).** That’s also the main reason why I am considering attending a DS Bootcamp (they have real-world projects as consulting services for other companies). Meanwhile, from their curriculum, it seems like the Bootcamp can be too fundamental for me and may not meet my needs. **So, any advice on how to work on high-quality DS/ML projects, besides going to a Bootcamp?** 

P.S., some people also recommend attending the Kaggle Competitions. But the downside of Kaggle is, you need to spend a great amount of time and energy in order to achieve a marginal improvement of your score, and there are a lot of tricks which can make Kaggle Competition a less efficient approach to improve you DS skillsets.

datascience,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for advices for a university project: I have a Kaggle dataset of 3GB which I have to preprocess and then apply a ridge regression written from scratch. One mandatory point is that my script should work flawlessly on andy dataset dimension, so theoretically I have to load up in ram as few dataset as possible. In this situation what should be the best tool to use? I tried with Pandas for preprocessing and numpy for the algorithm from scratch but the amount of RAM increases significantly. I used PySpark for data preprocessing and map/reduce approach for the algorithm but this time is the execution time that increases and the code is less understandable than using numpy. With pyspark I more or less don't see the difference in ram used whatever dataset portion I use, just time differences.

Is there a way to maybe distribute Pandas in order to use less RAM  (some kind of distribution) and something similar to use numpy in order to shrink execution time?

Thanks in advance!",Tool advice,1596447513
datascience,"I have a PhD in a mix of computer science and statistics. I currently hold a role as a Statistics lead with my own team in a large company (went from junior, to senior and then to lead).

I applied for a Senior Data Scientist role recently and went through a few round of interviews with 2 coding tests. I think I did fairly well and they were very complimentary of my code. I was asked to do a text processing task (something that was totally new to me - still with little research I solved their problem). It was obvious that models that they were building were slightly different than what i am used to, but all the principles of model building and validation are the same. I have worked before on Statistical end-to-end projects with clients.

It sort of feels like if I take this entry level offer, I could have gotten in straight out of my PhD and I wasted last 10 years. Statistics is an important part of data science so shouldn't that + experience in managing and leading projects be enough for Sr Data Scientist role?

datascience,"I""m an analyst, but just recently,  our teams job title got changed to ""Data scientist"" because we sometimes try to answer business questions by building predictive models.  I would say 90% of my work can be answered by univariate analysis (non modelling), while 10% may require some sort of model.  The models I do build are one-off models.  code the model, look at the coefficients, answer the question, and move on.  I dont deploy the models or anything.

In my mind, I did not expect this is what data scientists do.  I always imagine maybe 60% to 80% python/R/model building, looking at accuracy, lots more coding and writing production ready code.

Is this a realistic expectation or am I just over sensationalizing what a data scientist does?

When i'm thinking about my next career move, I feel like I want it to be a bit more ""data science"", but I'm not able to enunciate what is realistic in what I want. so I want to ask the group of data scientists here what your day looks like, from a work perspective.

datascience,"**TLDR: Incoming 3rd year CS student in college with two summers working internships in data science and SWE. I enjoyed data science a lot more but am concerned about long term career stability, compensation, and competition in data science vs SWE, especially if I don't go for a graduate degree. Would SWE be a safer bet in the long run?**

Hi everyone! I'm an incoming third year student in college studying Computer Science and Physics. I'm writing this post to hopefully get some advice on where to point my career path. I entered college wanting to study physics but quickly realized that I wasn't enthused with what a research career in physics implied, so I picked up computer science as well to explore career opportunities in technology.

The summer after my first year (so last summer), I worked as a data science intern at an F500 company. Minus the heavily bureaucratic corporate environment, I *really* enjoyed my experience and grew a lot technically, as I got to do things like survival analysis, clustering, and I was pleasantly surprised with the level of responsibility I was given. 

This summer I've been working as a software engineering intern at a big tech company. The pay, at least at the intern level, has definitely been light years ahead what I was making last summer. And just the general level of cushiness and ""prestige"" is quite nice. But I'm not sure that I actually enjoy engineering. I've had good performance so far and I am on track to get a return offer for next summer, but I spend most of the job working with dread. It's not exactly that it's boring or easy (not at all, I've struggled a lot) but that I am not getting satisfaction through the problems I'm solving.

My best idea on why I might have enjoyed my experience in data science more than SWE might be related to why I was interested in studying physics over something in engineering. I like science, analysis, statistical techniques, and just generally figuring shit out. Whereas I am not sure I quite enjoy building and developing systems and products as much.

Nonetheless, I am concerned that since data science is relatively new and not a career as well defined as SWE that I might be exposing myself to more career related risk by going down this path, and I am really trying to play things safe and at least leave college with a highly compensated job in technology. Additionally, it's also ambiguous whether graduate education is really required. I don't want to do a PhD, and masters programs seem like huge cash cows offering material I could learn myself (and try to fit in during the remainder of my undergrad). 

1. What does the distribution in compensation look like in data science vs SWE? By location? By level of company (e.g. F500 vs startups vs Big tech)? Are differences in comp between DS and SWE negligible enough that this shouldn't be my deciding factor?
2. Is securing data science jobs a lot more competitive than for SWE? Will I be at a huge disadvantage without graduate education?  
3. How common is it that most data science jobs are glorified data analyst positions? I know that the coolest, cutting edge work is for PhDs, but I at least want to work jobs which use more advanced ML techniques. Maybe my idea of data science work is colored by an unusually stimulating internship which I was lucky to experience.
4. Is there flexibility in jumping between the two jobs? I imagine it might be easier to jump into DS as a SWE if you have the statistical background than the other way around.

Hope I made sense and looking forward to any feedback from you all, especially those of you who might have made a similar decision for your careers. Thanks :)",Would it be risky to give up a career in software engineering for data science?,1596411341

datascience,"I've seen mentions of [DVC](https://dvc.org/) online in the last month or so. It looks [interesting](https://dvc.org/features) and might be useful for versioning data sets and computational artifacts (eg. trained parameter sets, simulation results).

**Has anyone tried this? Do you find it useful? Why?** 

I'm interested in this because I'm working on a simulation model where we update the inputs (eg. Google Mobility data) weekly and we either have to dump CSVs into Git (not ideal when they get 100MB+) or an external object store like AWS S3, which makes it hard to maintain a relation between a Git commit, model run and input data (which is important for reproducibility).

We also have simulation results + parameters sets that I've just been throwing into AWS S3 as `{model_name}-{unix timestamp}-{git commit hash}`, which mostly works fine, but it requried me to do a bunch of custom coding to get it to work.","Has anyone tried out the software ""Data Version Control""?",1596409565
