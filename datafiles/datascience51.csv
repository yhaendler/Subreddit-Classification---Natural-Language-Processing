It's been really annoying me and I've read a bit about how the Bank of New Zealand and other central banks have been trying to predict the current quarter's GDP using machine learning.

I started a masters program in CS last spring and have been working as an entry level analyst for about a year. I’m wondering if it would be better to stick where I am or try applying for more relevant internships.

I am working on a predictive model where I want to give suggestions as to how much weight increase a person should do between lift attempts at a powerlifting meet. Whether you succeed or fail your lift dictates the outcome--if a lift fails, you (almost) always do not change weight and attempt the same weight again. If you succeed, then you choose another higher weight for your next lift attempt. 

This means that for the failed lifts, the weight increase between lifts will almost always be 0, while the median increase in weight for successes is somewhere around 10kg, depending on the lift. My initial thoughts were to use an interaction between amount lifted and success/fail status of the lift to account for this, but it doesn't seem to fully take into consideration the drastically different outcomes. My initial models have an RMSE of about 4.5-4.6kg (both OLS and random forest are pretty similar), which is a bit higher than what I would hope for.  

At this point I'm wondering if it is a good idea to simply split my data into two sets--one for predicting on a success and one for predicting on a failure. On the other hand, I'm not sure if this is good practice or not. 

I will essentially be calculating off the initial lift weight -&gt; success/fail -&gt; if success then increase by predicted amount, if fail then probably do not change (the lift can fail due to judging rather than failure to complete the lift; in this case, it might be wise to increase the weight anyways). This doesn't seem like a bad idea to me but I'm wondering if this violates some common data practices. I tried searching on the internet but perhaps my google-fu is weak.

Say they give me a spreadsheet. To make sure I have repeatable code and I can see what I did, I do all of my cleaning in Python in a script.

At the end, I then can output my cleaned data and run my analysis. Great!

Then my coworkers will give me a new spreadsheet. It's similar! But slightly different. Maybe the columns are named a bit differently. Maybe the data has slightly different problems.

Hi All,

I'm a Post Doc researcher in the field of astrophysics and I'm considering a move out of academia and into data science. I'm not 100% sure the type of role I'd be looking at or what type of skills I'd need to highlight.

I've noticed that what I find the most interesting about my research is the process of designing the tools needed. So for example while I should be scientifically interested that a galaxy shows variable emission, I'm more interested in designing the start to finish analysis chain. Reducing the data, testing and then quantifying the certainty. I believe that I'm describing something akin to a Data Engineer or ML Engineer role.

Some context. My day-to-day research is largely working with Python/C++ (&amp; CERN's ROOT) to reduce, clean and analyze astrophysical data. To analyze data I might use something like BDTs to try and extract out a weak signal. Then apply some model to the data which requires some inference. Alternatively I might be writing the C++ code for a signal digitizer/Voltage supply or other lab equipment, which I'll then put in a python wrapper for use by the larger research group. I also primarily work with linux/OS .

Since I don't have a formal education in data science I'm wondering what key skills should I try to obtain or highlight that I meet the requirements. For example I'm considering taking a SQL course, are there any other course one might recommend? I've also taken courses in grad school on data science through python and machine learn via python. I don't  have any code that is publicly available to show, would it worthwhile taking additional courses in these areas, or perhaps create example projects on github?

These data I am working with usually have inconsistencies in formatting. Normally there are 4 attributes but occasionally I get 7-10 rows with 6 attributes, and I need to ignore these entirely. There is no consistency on where these additional lines appear. What is the best way to get rid of them? Is it worth the processing time to scan the db and drop these rows? It seems awfully expensive to check all 60+ million lines...

On the topic of dropping, these files also contain a couple attributes I don't want, as well as many duplicate entries that I don't need. Since I'll need to do several split/apply/combines on each of these csv files, is it recommended to 'clean up' the data first, and if so, what is the convention on doing so? I was thinking about a script to read in, clean up, then write out the data. This seems like a lot of read/writes to endure... but I *do* have to SCP the files onto a server to run the plotting code, so maybe I should? 

Any heads up on operations to **avoid** or performance optimization tips would really help me out. Unfortunately I am on my own with this project so I don't have anyone to ask except internet strangers.

I have spent the past 2 years taking programming classes after work (python, C++, intro to algorithms and data structures, visual basic).

The graph did show a positive correlation except for one of the values, in which there were only 2 rows in the dataset with that value, which threw off the results I was expecting.  My question is, when analyzing data if there are, for example, 10,000 rows, and one of the variables is categorical and has one of 4 different values, if the 4th value is only recorded 2 times and the other 9,998 entries are one of the other 3 categories, are you supposed to drop that 4th category because 2 entries isn't enough to make a conclusion?

datascience,"For context, I was in most people's shoes here so this is why I want to give back some advice and inspiration. There's a bit of misinformation in this subreddit so I'll consolidate my thinking. DM me if you need specific advice

Background:

1. Been working in quant/data science for 10-11 years now. Didn't know where to go because this field didn't exist when I was in school.
2. Self-taught. This is where my imposter syndrome appears but little did anyone know this. Learned SQL through sqlzoo, learned R as a hobby to day-trade (yahoo-finance api, zoo package, etc.), Python through codeschool(?) or codeacademy(?) in 2012 (it was free back then), Math through OCW/torrented whitepapers &amp; textbooks, ML through whitepapers &amp; textbooks (coursera did not exist yet)
3. Interviewed around a lot and got rejected a lot (100+). When I first began, this was not a field, but the interview process &amp; rejections gave me grit and understand what to study. I interviewed for a lot of exciting startups (now public companies) before they were even big. A small hedge fund gave me a chance as a quant trader, and our group got shut down in a year. I got a second chance somewhere else and the company went public (data science was central to their strategy)
4. Data Science is exciting. This field has brought me around the world. Worked at a hedge fund, electricity markets, global consulting, somehow ended up doing A.I work, and now in a leadership strategy role. I don't oversee data scientists anymore, they mostly report to my business function now but previously managed 20+ data scientists.  Worked all over the globe and across many, many states. 

Advice:

1. Study and code everyday. Make it a habit. Blog posts, whitepapers, textbooks. I've lost this habit and I regret it -- getting back into it. You should love learning, otherwise you're in the wrong field.
2. Build up your foundations. Python/R, Probability/Stats/Calculus/LinAlg/DiffEq, Algorithms. This will help you understand a lot . Do take an algorithms &amp; design course. Most problems are solved through a design approach / framework rather than a model.
3. Stay in touch with whats going on. hackernews/datatau/rweekly &amp; understanding new Data Engineering trends, Tech Engineering Blogs. Example, when I read some company blog about their implementation of spark in 2014, I immediately started playing around with it with my models.
4. Always be humble &amp; prepare to get humbled but remain self-confident and determined. Don't be afraid.
5. Find a subject you like to get started. Loving data &amp; modeling is one thing, but find an area that really interests you. For me, I started with time series (not for the faint of heart). This introduced me to a lot of difficult concepts.
6. Find a product/field. For me it was Energy &amp; Finance. It can be marketing, sales, finance, pure ML, pure optimization work, supply chain, etc. Being a general hobbyist will only get you so far.",Experience/Advice from a 10+ year data scientist,1599561718
