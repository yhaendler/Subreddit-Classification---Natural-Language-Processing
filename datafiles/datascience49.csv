datascience,"Hi all, I'm looking to get into Data Science as a career. I was wondering what path I should take and what I need to teach myself.

My background:

I very recently graduated with a degree in Aerospace Engineering. I know python (somewhat), MATLAB, C++, and FORTRAN. I know python is huge for data science, and I have somewhat self taught myself how to code in python. However, I have done very few projects in Python; most of my coding in school was MATLAB or C++. Another deficiency in my education is probability and stats. I didn't take any classes on those so besides basic statistic principles for lab work, I'm not super familiar with stats/probability.

Right now, my plan is to go to grad school in a year for a CS degree. I'm hoping I can get involved in research concerning machine learning and AI, as I've heard those topics are very good for data science. I was wondering if there is any other additional things I should be doing in the meantime (besides studying for the GRE of course). Should I learn R or any other languages? Are there any certificates I should be going for? Should I load up resume with Python projects? Do you all think I can get a data science job with my current skill-set?

Also, what are you all's thoughts on getting my CS degree from Europe? I'm very interested in studying abroad (e.g. Spain) as it's cheaper, still rigorous, and would be a really cool experience. But, my main career goal is to get a remote job in USD so perhaps it'd be better to stay in the USA in the meanwhile to get the USA job before going remote?

datascience,"Hi all, I graduated in 2019 with a liberal arts degree with a focus in mathematics and quantum mechanics from a small private liberal arts college. I now work full-time at a biotech company on the West Coast as a logistics administrator. I absolutely hate my job!! But in this year and a half since graduating I have found a passion for data analytics and data science.
Since quarantine, I have been learning SQL, Python and the fundamentals of computer science. I really enjoy coding (although it’s extremely frustrating at times). Along with learning the technical languages I have been taking a course on data science that touches on the statistics, machine learning, and data visualization part of the role. Again I’m truly enjoying it, but I am stuck in a crossroad because I am nervous that all of this work and time that I am putting into these courses will go unnoticed by employers and the only way to get my foot in the door is by having a technical degree or a data science masters degree. 


I am not opposed going to grad school for a masters in data science or mathematics or statistics, however, I do not want to take out any more students loans unless I absolutely have to! 

My hope is to be able to leverage my liberal arts education (and focus in math) and my self-taught learning to land a job in the business sector or e-commerce sector. Trust me, I know it may be difficult but I am more than happy to climb the ladder. I have also been thinking of looking more into data analyst roles in order to get my foot in the door, although I have heard that is difficult to make the transition from data analyst to a data scientist. 

Do you have any advice if I should continue with this path or if it’s best for me to look at Boot Camp’s or grad school? Please help! I would really appreciate any insight!

I have created an algorithm that is time independent and uses mostly stationary features (more than 2,000 features).

There are 2 ML layers. The first layer takes the original input data set and picks out a subset of it that picks which time periods are actionable. The reason for this is to decrease heteroscadisticity between “no action” and “action”. The second ML layer picks the time to create a market buy order which it believes with high probability that within the next 24 hours there will be a time where my initial buy price will increase by 1.2%. When it hits that threshold, the order is closed. The accuracy of this approach is 89%. The other 11% are either profitable at less than +1.2% or unprofitable at lower than 0%. I personally am willing to take a risk when only 11% of the trades are not hitting that 1.2% threshold. Also note that there can be multiple orders open at a time.

In a case, you don’t need all rows, you can read the dataset in chunks and filter unnecessary rows to reduce the memory usage:

    iter_csv = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv', iterator=True, chunksize=1000) df = pd.concat([chunk[chunk['field'] &gt; constant] for chunk in iter_csv]) 

**Tip 2: Filter columns while reading**

In a case, you don’t need all columns, you can specify required columns with “usecols” argument when reading a dataset:

    df = pd.read_csv('file.csv', usecols=['col1', 'col2']) 

**Tip 3: Combine both approaches**

The great thing about these two approaches is that you can combine them. So filtering which rows to read and limiting the number of columns.

During that time I took some open online courses in Python programming.

* I read about people discussing masters helping them and people saying it is unnecessary. But my biggest reasoning why not to get one is because of how much resources are actually available for free or low cost. I mean everyone knows that on here. The reason I see it as beneficial to get one:

1. Networking and school name
2. Some companies might require that title
3. Paying for the degree would keep some people discipline with the work. 

* But personally I kind of like the idea of doing it on my own and I guess the interdependent spirit of the process. Now demonstrating my skills with projects is where I see the struggle and why I even hint at doing the masters. But I feel like many others struggle with this part and I confident I can put something together. Also, even with the masters, doing projects is still going to be part of the process.

So, I wouldn't say I am a complete novice. 

My friend and I know that we're inexperienced and to counter this, we've decided to kind of start a free data science consulting. Free in the sense that it's more of a pay-what-you-want model, where we do stuff for people and then in the end, they can pay us whatever they feel like (could potentially be 0 as well). We’ve begun cold emailing some small start-ups in California and well, the response has been lukewarm. So far, we only have a website with a portfolio of three projects on it, no GitHub or medium or anything like that. 

My question now is: has anyone tried something like this before, maybe within data science or some other field? I have read about people suggesting this PWYW model on forums but never really heard anything like a success story about it. We’re not even in this industry so I don’t know if this kind of thing is even in demand, so some advice about it would be great. Is our inexperience going to inevitably lead us to failure or should we just persist, send out more cold emails and see ourselves through this rough initial phase?

I’m currently in the Midwest and Ive been interviewing for some data science/data analyst jobs in the Bay Area but getting very discouraged. Id like to get into a top tech company like google or facebook and have gotten opportunities to interview with Facebook, square, and amazon but always end up getting cut after a few rounds.   


The interview process has been very draining tbh... Ive had to work on tons of case studies and code challenges that are very time consuming only to be cut and the interviews I’ve had seem to ask a lot of brain teaser questions which are difficult to prepare for. The thing is some of my interviewers that work as data scientists came from non-data backgrounds like biology or journalism and were able to get in, but I am having a hard time getting through. I’ve also had interviewers that were very dismissive and barely let me answer any questions before writing me off, which is something ive noticed about some Bay Area companies.

We compare TVAE and CTGAN with these baselines. Our benchmark contains 7 simulated datasets and 8 real datasets. Simulated data: We handcrafted a data oracle S to represent a known joint distribution, then sample Ttrain and Ttest from S. This oracle is either a Gaussian mixture model or a Bayesian network. We followed procedures found in \[21\] to generate Grid and Ring Gaussian mixture oracles. We added random offset to each mode in Grid and called it GridR.

datascience,"Hi fellow data scientists!

Starting September 7, I will teach a project module on Python and/or data science to 16-17 year old high school students. It is scheduled for one hour per week, for 9 weeks in total, so that makes 9 hours to teach these kids something about programming and/or data science. The group will be quite diverse; most of them won't have any prior programming experience (and if they have, their skills will be limited).

My first thought was: I'll just give a Python intro course, and after 9 weeks we will have covered the basics of conditionals and iteration. But then I was thinking: maybe I should do something with data science. It is my own professional area, so I'm quite comfortable with it, and it is also more exciting than a vanilla programming course.

But I cannot seem to find a project or topic that is both **doable** and **interesting**. I have been looking into the datasets hosted on Kaggle, but most of them require quite a bit of preprocessing (and therefore programming skill). There is one which is quite clean: the red wine quality dataset ([https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)), but it's not a particularly interesting one. This dataset, however, would allow me to plot some interesting correlations, and maybe apply some sklearn model, without the need for heavy preprocessing or huge programming skills.

But I'm not yet convinced of the idea. Maybe I'm expecting too much of these students and I'm making things more complicated than they need to be.

datascience,"I've seen this practice done in blog posts and I wanted to get the opinion of the community:

Let's say I have a regressor that predicts some continuous variable. I can take some holdout data and make predictions with the intention of calculating the absolute value of the differences between my predicted values and the true values. With that data you can train another regressor to predict (with the same input data as your first regressor) what the difference between the predicted value of your first model and the true value is likely to be.

With that you take your original models predicted value and +- the output of your second model multiplied by some Z score (depending on the confidence interval you're looking for) almost treating the output of your second model as the standard error of your original models prediction.

To me this seems to be one of those cases where this practice isn't exactly rooted in statistics but can be useful to construct these pseudo-confidence intervals.

My question to you guys is: am I right to be critical of this practice? Or is there some statistical reasoning that validates this? In any case I do see the usefulness of the approach but I question it's legitimacy.
