books,"On 4chan there's three books that always get referenced: Ulysses by Joyce, Gravity's Rainbow by Pynchon and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. They get referenced because each of them is a long, rather complex novel and each uses experimental writing technique.               

A couple years ago I made it a goal to read all of them (at least before I die) and was initially nervous because the amount of effort seemed like it was rather high. The good news is that: It wasn't! It was actually relatively easy to read the books and the plots of all of them were quite good! I've always read quite a bit but the departure from short, low-risk books into literary doorstoppers was a lot better than I initially expected. On top of learning quite a bit about the world, I got to experience some of the most vivid depictions of ridiculous things I've ever tried to visualize. Monkeys running wild, a giant erection splitting the clouds, a cyclops in an Irish bar, a kid with his tongue stuck to a window, a group of wheelchair assassins and so much more.

books,"I've had books I loved with slow or uninteresting sections, and I've read books I chose to leave halfway through because they weren't worth my time. But after a Christmas-gifted book from an aunt I love came into my life, I've found a new dilemma: wanting to finish a book I wouldn't personally choose to. 

Do you, dear person reading this, have any advice on how to do something faster than speed-reading, getting the plot without much of the detail? In college I passed most of my older-English classes leaning heavily on online summaries, and that always worked pretty well as at least giving me the ability to keep up in discussions and as something solid enough to build the basis of many mediocre essays.

books,"I was always an avid reader growing up, but fell off the wagon in recent years, sometimes only reading one or two books in an entire year. 

This year, I really wanted to read 20 books, and today, I achieved my goal :) 

Here are the books I read this year, with some notes and my rating for them. Also, I am a big ass crybaby so I'll note if I cried or not after reading the book. 

1. **A Dance with Dragons, George R.R. Martin -** 4/5 stars. When the fuck is the next one coming out??????? That's what I want to know. Did I cry? Yes. 
2. **Save Me the Plums, Ruth Reichl -** 4/5 stars. I'm a big foodie, so I really enjoyed this book. Also, I was hungry any time food was described, so if you are going to read this, make sure you do it on a full stomach. Did I cry? No. 
3. **The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, Shaffer and Barrows**  \- 3/5 stars. I found the format to be interesting, but the book ended up being super tedious and I had a hard time getting through it. Did I cry? Yes, but only because I'm a crybaby bitch 
4. **Know My Name, Chanel Miller** \- 4/5 stars. A fantastic book that was super emotional for me. I really enjoyed it, but the last few chapters seemed repetitive to me. Did I cry? Yes. 
5. **The Clockmaker's Daughter, Kate Morton** \- 2.5/5 stars. I enjoyed it, but the ending seemed really silly sooooooo I am giving it 2.5 stars. Did I cry? No. 
6. **The Tea Girl of Hummingbird Lane, Lisa See -** 4.5/5 stars. So beautiful, at times a little predictable/cheesy, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. This book is what got me on my Lisa See kick. I ended up reading a bunch of books from her this year because of this one. Did I cry? Yes. 
7. **Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, Lisa See** \- 4/5 stars. About two girls in China who become ""laotong"" or sworn sisters. Really beautiful story and the writing is excellent. Did I cry? No.
8. **Calypso, David Sedaris** \- 4/5 stars. Really funny, but I had a hard time getting into it. The story about the turtle and the tumor had me rolling. Honestly, the only reason why I read this book was because I read this review on goodreads: ""On the inside of this book, David Sedaris signed it and wrote, ""Joe, I am so happy you're alive."" He then proceeded to write in my girlfriend at the time's book, ""You can do better."" Did I cry? No.
9. **Evvie Drake Starts Over, Linda Holmes** \- 2/5 stars. Boring, predictable, and...boring. Basically two people meet and fall in love and that's the whole book with nothing interesting about it whatsoever. Easily the worst book I read this year. I had to force myself to finish it. Did I cry? No.
10. **Olive Kitteridge, Elizabeth Strout** \- 4/5 stars. Good, but I had a hard time getting through it. Did I cry? No.
11. **Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, J.K. Rowling** \- 5/5 stars. Re-read, Harry Potter is my favorite series.  Did I cry? No.
12. **Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, J.K. Rowling** \- 5/5 stars. Re-read, Harry Potter is my favorite series.  Did I cry? No.
13. **Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, J.K. Rowling** \- 5/5 stars. Re-read, Harry Potter is my favorite series.  Did I cry? No.
14. **On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous, Ocean Vuong** \- 5/5 stars. Absolutely stunning book that talks about a lot of hard topics, and I highly recommend this book to everyone. Did I cry? Yes. 
15. **Exhalation, Ted Chiang** \- 4/5 stars. A gorgeous collection of short stories. The first story was so breathtakingly beautiful that I had to put the book down for a while to ponder it. Some of the stories were just okay, but overall, a really enjoyable collection. Did I cry? No.
16. **My Dark Vanessa, Kate Elizabeth Russell** \- 4.5/5 stars. As a sexual abuse survivor, this book was incredibly difficult to read. I had a really hard time putting it down even though it made me feel like shit. However, it's incredibly captivating and well-written. Did I cry? Yes. 
17. **The Henna Artist, Alka Joshi** \- 4.5/5 stars. I really loved this book and I highly recommend it. Did I cry? Yes.
18. **The Sun is Also a Star, Nicola Yoon** \- 2.5/5 stars. Two horny teenagers (one of which is about to be deported) meet and spend a day together being horny teens and finding meaning where it doesn't exist. Waaaay too cliche and unrealistic. The writing was just okay, and I felt like it was 3x longer than it had to be. I was shocked at the good reviews on goodreads. Did I cry? No.
19. **Shanghai Girls, Lisa See** \- 4/5 stars. Did I cry? No.
20. **Dreams of Joy, Lisa See** \- 4/5 stars. This book is the second part to Shanghai Girls and is about life in China during the Great Leap Forward. Some of the descriptions... yikes. I had a hard time getting through some parts. But at the end, I got the happy ending that I hoped for. A little cliche, a little unrealistic, a little bit too long, but overall really enjoy Lisa See's writing style and this book was lovely. Did I cry? Yes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unemployed recent college graduate Ruby is forced to move back in with her parents, into the rent-free but dismal basement apartment of a posh NYC building where her father, Martin, is the superindendent. The events of the novel take place in one day.

Ruby's oldest friend, Caroline, the trust fund daughter of the building’s penthouse resident, is throwing a party that evening in the penthouse.  Growing up, Ruby saw both worlds: Martin's, and Caroline's.  Martin's growing resentment of the rich and condescending residents whom he serves manifests itself as the voice of a recently deceased resident, the politically strident anti-capitalist Lily.  In Martin's thoughts, the voice of Lily attributes Martin's fraught relationship with his daughter to the class inequity between his family and the residents, particularly to Caroline.

A homeless woman claiming to be Lily’s cousin appears in the building foyer.  Martin asks her to leave the premises.  Ruby finds this act heartless, further straining her relationship with Martin.  Later, Ruby sees that the homeless woman is still in the foyer, so Ruby lets her inside the building.  When Ruby tells this story to Caroline, Caroline exclaims that they should help the woman and enlist the help of her friend Andy, a trust fund beneficiary and photographer who takes artistic photos of homeless people.

That afternoon, through Caroline's contacts, Ruby has an interview for her dream job at the Museum of Natural History.  Martin, during a house call to the penthouse to fix a door, learns from Caroline that the job is sctually an unpaid internship. He tosses a stone for Caroline to catch, but instead it lands in her coffee mug and shatters it.  After the interview, Ruby, disappointed at discovering that there is no paying job being offered, takes a walk and bumps into Andy.  Andy invites Ruby into his home and offers her money to pose with a rhino head.  While posing, Andy gropes Ruby, but Ruby smashes Andy with the rhino head, sending him to the bathroom to clean up his bloody nose.  Ruby escapes with the rhino head and abandons it at the Museum of Natural History.

Caroline confronts Ruby about the incident with Andy, defending Andy’s version of events.  Caroline also tells Ruby that Martin “freaked out” on her, but promises not to report Martin to her father.  Later that evening, Ruby attends Caroline’s party, and sees  Andy, who demands the return of the rhino head.  Ruby demands the promised payment for modelling with the rhino head.  Ruby takes Andy’s wallet from his pocket and leaves the party.

Ruby returns home and Ruby and Martin both listen to an answering machine message from the property management company, apopleptic at Martin’s incident with Caroline and the stone.  Martin will be fired and kicked out of the rent-free basement apartment.  Ruby is incensed that Caroline broke her promise to not report the incident.  Ruby goes to the penthouse to confront Caroline, where she finds Caroline and Andy on the roof with the homeless woman.  Andy is photographing Caroline with the homeless woman, and Caroline asks Ruby where she should stand. Ruby advises Caroline to move back a step, which causes Caroline to fall off the roof.  

In the epilogue, Caroline is injured and her friendship with Ruby is over.  Martin moved to Georgia where he works at a new job and lives in a second floor apartment.  He is content.  Ruby works as a security guard at the Museum of Natural History, and lives with room mates in Astoria.  Martin wants Ruby to move to Georgia, but Ruby wants to stay in NYC and spend the time growing up and discovering herself.","Plot Summary: The Party Upstairs, by Lee Conell (SPOILERS)",1596145972

&gt;Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play.

[This picture](https://imgur.com/a/evbWAll) seems to be the perfect symbol for the above quote. Praised as ""The Most Beautiful Suicide,"" Evelyn McHale's death shows when the shock of artistic drama exceeds the sorrow of her fatal tragedy. The media and its audience became spectators rather than sympathizers. Does this mean the highest form of beauty lacks the most basic emotion?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To become the spectator of one's own life...is to escape the suffering of life.

I caught the irony when I was doing my post-reading quote-picking. Quite ironic of Dorian Gray to suffer so greatly when he became the literal spectator of his life (the picture). Perhaps Harry was wrong this time.

The final discussion thread for July book club is here. Hopefully you all enjoyed this month's selection. Don't forget to join us again next month. Below you will find the discussion questions for this section.

&gt;Daniel never knew if Kay wanted him to apologize or reassure her. Either way, he always felt implicated, like there was some expectation he wasn't meeting.

* What do you think Kay wanted from Daniel? Or was it all in Daniel's mind?

&gt;All this time, he'd been waiting for his real life to begin: Once he was accepted by Roland's friends and the band made it big. Once he found his mother. Then, things would change. But his life had been happening all along, in the jolt of the orange juice on his tongue or how he dreamt in two languages, how his students' faces looked when they figured out the meaning of a new word, the wisp of smoke as he blew out his birthday candles. 

* Can you relate to this realization? 
* Where do you think Daniel's life started to go wrong?
* How has your opinion on the different characters changed over the course of the book?
* How do you feel about the ending of the book? Did it surprise you where Daniel ended up?
* Who do you think The Leavers in the title refer to?",Final Discussion Thread for The Leavers by Lisa Ko - July Book Club,1596133242
books,"I never considered myself a writer. Honestly, I never did. It's just... I had that story that unconsciously, over the years, formed in my head, but because (as I said) I'm not a writer, I didn't know what to do with it. In the beginning, I just had a slight notion that I should let it out of my mind, release it somehow, but as time went by (and the story persistently dwelled in my mind), I eventually end up with an idea of writing it down on paper. It is strange how little time passed before my ""slight notion"" turned into the urge, even less before that urge quietly slid into an obsession. And I'm not bullshitting you here. In that time, I couldn't concentrate on anything else, business or personal, because every time I contemplated about the future (plans), all I got in my mind was a blank space around the idea of ""me writing a book"". So, in early 2007, I started writing.

&amp;#x200B;

In April that year, I took two weeks off from my work. I bought a tiny laptop and went to the small village on the Adriatic coast (""am I a writer or not?"", I thought). That was the first time I tried to transfer the story from my head into the written words. And it seemed easy; I first wrote my raw thought down on paper (during the day-long walks along the shore), then at night, in my apartment, I refined those ""scratchings"" using a word-processor on my laptop. At the end of my ""holiday"", I had a notebook full of scribbles and a (merely) fifty pages long Word document. Back at home, I let the material brew for a few days, then I started reading it empty-headed, like an uninformed reader. And guess what? It wasn't just (simply) bad writing. It was embarrassing.

&amp;#x200B;

A year passed by, during which I managed to forget about the ""writing"", but the itch returned when I got fired during the global financial crisis in late 2008. I wasn't pressured to run after a new job, so I thought ""what the hell"" and started writing again. But this time it was different. It wasn't easy at all. I knew what I wanted to say and I knew how I want to say it, but I couldn't transfer this mental representation from my head into the text of any literary value. I used to stare for hours (literally) through the space on the paper where the capital letter should precede after the dot. My writing was slow, slow, so painfully slow, that in the next two years I wrote less than on my two-week Adriatic vacation. The quality was a bit better, yes, but still, it was just bad, lousy writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 2011 I found (what people call) a ""dream job"". In a very respectable company I was (very generously) paid to do what I would be doing anyway in my life. For the first two years, I was a real model employee, staying-off-hours-albeit-nobody-asked-me and all that, but as soon I settled down within the company hierarchy, the old, seemingly forgotten burden reared its ugly head. Once more, I forced myself to start writing, and I started (again) from scratch. At first, I wrote twice a week after the work, then every second night, but it wasn't long before I was spending every night dealing with (my old pal) long writer's blockades, ending in a few lines of meaningful text. To make things worse, as time went by I became so obsessed with my writing, that I neglected my daily job. All day through I thought about what and how I should write, while the quality of my bill-paying profession turned into a mechanical daily grind. And it was like that for years.

&amp;#x200B;

In the winter of 2017, the company fired my ass. My only thought was, ""what took them so long?""

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend's reaction to the news was supportive. She told me that I could stay living with her until I finish my book and/or find another job. I agreed to that and continue writing from her apartment, but once again it felt very different. Writing the story wasn't just plain hard anymore. It became agony. Every word I typed felt like ripping it out of my guts with a pair of pliers. Every sentence I created resulted in real, physical pain in my stomach. Writing to me was like climbing a steep mountain with a heavy rock tied on my back with no summit or end in sight. Every single day became torture, every paragraph suffering, but for some (unknown) reason I wasn't willing to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, one morning, the depression came. I woke up at nine in the morning, and just lied down with my eyes closed till noon. Even then I didn't want to get out of the bed. Why? What's the point? Why getting up, when everything that awaits me is the labor of Sisyphus? Interestingly enough, soon that became the least of my worries. I was starting to suspect that I have cancer (different types, depending on the day), or that I'm dying. One day while riding on the bus, through the window I saw a man with blood on his head, lying unconscious on the pavement. I didn't know what's going on, but I came up with an idea that police will somehow accuse me for what happened to him, charge me for the assault, trial me, and put me in jail. The funny thing was that I knew how stupid and irrational my theories were (cancer, the dying, the imprisonment), but nevertheless, they supplied me with large quantities of unbearable anxiety and excruciating fear every day. I continued with writing though, every night; and it was still a torment, but chapters actually began to take a form, and quality of written text seemed (to me) greatly improved.

&amp;#x200B;

The vast majority of (successful) suicides happen early in the morning. That is because the person (victim?) can not bear the weight of the new day. And it is true. As I mentioned (in that time, mid-2017), I was usually waking up very early in the morning, but I wasn't getting out of bed until noon. For all that ""awake time"" I contemplated how it will be the best if I just kill myself. Like on a treadmill, in my head I looped ""mental movies"" with me as a lead actor performing all kinds of successful suicide attempts, over and over again. It didn't take long before I turned from just fantasizing to actually googling the stuff and reading the countless pages about different suicide techniques on the internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was when I realized that I will do it. I mean, kill myself. I was just two chapters away from completing the book.

&amp;#x200B;

As a psychologist, I knew that psychiatrists and doctors cannot help me, but I went to visit one anyway. I thought they could get me some medication that will stop me from killing myself and just let me finish the book. And that was exactly what the doctor ordered. Along with a few (tasteless) jokes that were all the verbal therapy I received, I got a prescription for the famous ""selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor"". One ""happy pill"" a day, to be taken first thing in the morning before lunch, and that's it. The effect of the medication, as the doctor informed me, will (or should) be visible only after three to six weeks. But it only took ten days for a ""happy pill"" to completely demolish (ruin, annihilate) my entire organism.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, after just a few days, I experienced total (and I mean TOTAL) sexual impotence. Contrary to the majority of people, I considered that as a positive outcome; I had one thing less to interfere with my writing. But this outcome wasn't positive at all. Impotence prevented me from getting an erection and ejaculation but didn't prevent the accumulation of the semen, which now I was unable to ""let out"" in a natural way. After five days, the pain around my crouch was so fierce that I couldn't even sit nor walk normally. Besides that, I completely lost my appetite, so I had to force myself to eat regular daily meals. I also got pathological insomnia (I haven't slept two or three days in a row, and I didn't felt tired), and I got flashes of sudden and acute sweating, with no apparent reason, that would make my underwear soaking wet.

&amp;#x200B;

After exactly ten days, on my own initiative, I have stopped taking the ""happy pill"". I was just one chapter far from completing my story.

&amp;#x200B;

Just before I started writing that last chapter, my girlfriend told me that she can not take it anymore. She can not watch me deteriorate in front of her eyes anymore. It was over. If I ever had the best thing in my life, that was her, and it was over. It also was the last piece of the puzzle that helped me finish the last chapter of my book. Now, I knew that I won't kill myself. I was sure that I won't do it because I already died. I died when she left me, and one could not die twice. I do not want to be cheap or pathetic here, but again, I'm not bullshitting you, either. I moved to my mother's apartment (after twenty years) and didn't get out of bed for a solid two weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

In February 2018, after eleven years, I finished my book. I read it out loud (just to myself), from the first page to the last, and I wasn't embarrassed. And not just that. I got the impression that I wrote the story that has never been told. For me, that was enough.

&amp;#x200B;

After 11 years of prison, I was a free man. A free man, again.

&amp;#x200B;

Epilogue:

It took me another half a year to get the book properly edited and translated, but that's a completely different horror story. 

&amp;#x200B;

After releasing the book on Kindle store I have found a new job, even better paid than the previous one. One year later, I was fired again. This time, it wasn't my fault.

&amp;#x200B;

My misery and depression weren't washed away instantly. They faded away slowly, in a couple of months, but they faded away completely. I'm not bothered with fears or anxiety anymore, at least not more than other people do. The only fear that bothers me now is fear that someday I would start writing again.","So, you wanna be a writer? My journey from ""writer's itch"" to googling ""painless suicide"".",1596133198

The majority of the books I do find were published in 96/97, before the conflicts in the Balkans were really finished, so I am worried those ones may provide a biased or incomplete view. The more recent books published in the past 20 years are mostly just personal accounts from survivors of the Bosniak genocide. While I think those are important stories, I am more interested in learning about the wars themselves and the events that led up to them. Is the apparent lack of material due to my looking in the wrong places, or the fact that those conflicts are too recent for modern historians to begin covering? I know the rule of thumb is that one must wait at least 25 years after an event for good historical research.

books,"Hi all, this is my first post in this sub-reddit. I generally love reading fiction. Especially sci-fi and fantasy, and even though I don't remember every information/the story in the books in a chronological manner, I remember the essence of the stories I have read so far because I feel that I tend to enjoy the progression of the stories that I read and I get immersed in the world of the book. For instance, the Harry Potter series, Bartimaeus trilogy, Dune saga, etc.

But, when it comes to reading non-fiction books, I get sort of anxious. Not because I feel the subject will be complicated for my understanding, but the reason for me is that, I start thinking (before I read) whether I will be able to remember all the information given in the books and later recall them if and when necessary. This also saps out the enjoyment factor associated with reading non-fiction books, even though I am very much interested in the topics.

Also, while reading ""textbooks"" during undergrad and grad years, I used to read the books and solve problems, engage in discussions, submit assigments, and gave exams based on them that re-enforced my understanding of a said subject. Unfortuanetly that is not the scenario with reading a non-fiction book where the author has spent years of her/his/their research and penned them down to make the book accessible to the general audience.

I don’t want to spoil the book, but I’d highly recommend it as it’s a super helpful insight on how colonization affects communities and denigrates their culture from the inside. The book does so subtly, without ever stating that the white mans intrusion in Nigeria was overtly harmful. More so, it reminded me that “traditionalist” or non-Western values aren’t inherently wrong although they’re not widely accepted in white, Western society. 

I totally recommend it— it’s also totally captivating and you can’t help but root for the protagonist throughout. I ended up finishing the book in one sitting!

It started off okay and I was intrigued by Ellen and the role she would obviously play throughout the book, and curious when and how Tom would finally get to build his cathedral. 

But now, a third of the way through, I hate most of the characters. Ellen’s action to have sex with Tom a mere few hours after his wife died seemed... questionable and made me a little annoyed with her, but okay. But after that I only got more sad, annoyed and angry. A lot of the men behave like frightened, egotistical, shallow idiots in my opinion, to the women and to each other. I’ve had to put the book away multiple times in the past 24 hours because I just got too anxious about the rape scene (I skipped over as much as I could) and all the misfortune after that. I got especially angry after Richard first tries to protect Ariana when William and his groom rape her and then doesn’t care if she becomes a whore against her will once they’re in the city, because he’s hungry. I mean, really?

The reason I’m posting here and not just putting the book away is that I’m not sure if this is just Follett’s writing style or if the book develops into something else.

books,"Hey all

I've been truly struggling with finding a ""good"" book to read that's right up my alley. I tend to love first person narratives. I figured it might help if I mentioned a few that I really enjoyed in the past.

Recently I read Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, Franny and Zooey by JD Salinger, Miracle in the Andes by Nando Parrado (life-changing), The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches by Gaétan Soucy, and a really cool short story called ""Flowers for Algernon"" by Daniel Keyes. I thoroughly enjoyed each of these works. Somebody recommended, bases on these reads, that I try Watership Down by Richard Adams and Zeno's Conscience by Italo Svevo, both of which are failing to capture me. 

So I am really hoping somebody will introduce me to a book that I like. My all-time favorite used to be The Catcher in the Rye, but I recently re-read it and found that I only liked it because of the age at which I was exposed to it. I read it at the ""right"" time and that time for me has past.
