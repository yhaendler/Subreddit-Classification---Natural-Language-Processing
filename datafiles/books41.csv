books,"In the beginning of the book, there’s a misunderstanding between Ai and Estraven about a complication that threatens the success of Ai’s mission, and Ai suspects Estraven of having used him in a power struggle or having otherwise manipulated him the entire time they've known each other.   It all sets up this tragic story that culminates in a very moving scene involving Estraven near the end of the book.  

The problem is that both times I read the book, Estraven's intentions seemed sincere to me pretty much from the start.  Even if you’re unfamiliar with the culture, you wouldn’t hear what he says and attribute ulterior motives or foul play to him.  I get that the protagonist feels like Estraven was sorta leading him on for a period of time, but at worst it feels more like a “Dude, you kinda blew it” thing than a “You were using me this whole time” thing.

books,"I was reminded of this short story existing recently. While at the time, I thought it was the most useless whiny pile of garbage I had ever seen, now I think it perfectly captures the useless whiny garbage attitude of millennials.

In the short story, the protagonist thinks he is rebelling against an oppressive society by quitting his job in a vocal and rude fashion after the store's manager tells some women in bathing suits to cover themselves the next time they shop there, as per store policy. As he leaves, he fumes about how hard life will be for him because he did a stupid thing for no reason, and the girls did not even care that he did it. 

I can't think of a better way to capture the feeling of millennials today that are doing all these protests. It's never clear what they are protesting about beyond some kind of oppressive society that loves evil cops, and they think they should all get paid a lot more because life is hard living in expensive cities. John Updike clearly knew what these people were like, and he wrote this story way before their time!","Revisiting ""A&amp;P"" by John Updike",1595196610

books,"Hiya, I find that a fair number of reviews and  recommendations  give away a lot of the plot and key events that make a book enjoyable, especially with regards to fantasy and sci-fi books. So I'm trying to come up with a basic system that lets readers know what to generally  expect on various book elements.   


Using the simple negative to positive scale below, I'll rank each factor and add it all up to a final score and recommendation. In a very simple video review, I'd expand on each category a bit but would this work in say the recommendation thread?

books,"India is a young country. Though, many consider the land to be an ancient gateway to culture, civilisation and heritage, India is still a young country. A large number of Indian households gained access to the internet in the mid 2000s. These were the middle class, the conformists who stayed within the limits of decency. The silent majority, however, never had their voices heard, their opinions discussed, their ""rougher around the edges"" ideas dissected. But then in 2016, through the wonders of disruptive technology, they didn't need to stay silent any more.

Once India's common man was on the *interweb* there was no stopping their voice. And as these voices only grew louder and more boisterous, the opinions  only became nastier and the discourse veered off the beaten path of decency and respect.

India's hyper aggressive, hyper nationalist 'troll army* was born. And in a matter of 4 short years, government agencies, large corporations and the odd bollywood celebrity has successfully mobilised this troll army to mould dialogue and to filter out unsolicited opinions.

This phenomenon is meticulously explored in Indrapramit Das's *Kali_Na.*  A story that combines female empowerment with the avante garde, this is a great example of how an author can successfully use their own heritage and background to stitch together such a gripping tale.

*Kali_Na* is steeped in rich Indian culture, it explores the stories many *Desi* children have heard about *Ma Durga,* the Goddess of Divine Power. She is the  embodiment of strength and morality as she  balances good and evil on the tip of her legendary weapons.

Das masterfully bridges the gap between these traditional stories and path breaking virtual reality technology. With every instance of rich folklore storytelling, they interject with instances of 21st century India and how our young protagonist fights to survive in an ever changing and fast evolving society.

The story opens with the traditional festival season in India, where millions have flocked to the streets of Calcutta to catch a view of a VR goddess. Human kind's penchant for the divine does not diminish as the years go by, in fact with the onset of newer technologies, their hunger and yearning to meet their goddess face to face grows even stronger. 

Durga our young protagonists and a name sake of the Goddess is our guide in this world. Through her eyes we see the future where *the opium of the masses* now comes at a cost. 

However, this science fiction story is more than just an exploration of societal chasms between the traditional and the modern. Das, in fact creates a very real world. A real world that has empowered the *belligerent troll army* to stand up and speak out against anything that is not shaped by the pockets of their masters. 

Here in, lies our story. The story of Durga, good and evil. As the three forces come to meet each other, one can expect many bangs and explosions. 

Through Durga's eyes, Das explores the culture of cyber-bullying and the limits to which such trolls will go to spit their venom. The reader should not expect an insipid retelling of the fight between good and evil. Rather this is a tale of the pushback against a hateful wave of intolerance that has grown in leaps and bounds. The author has only been clever enough to create a compelling world using the tools of his culture, a world which he drags the reader into as they read *Kali_Na.*

*Kali_Na* is available as a short story in the science fiction anthology, *The Mythic Dream.*",Indian sci fi is a fascinating genre as it employs familiar tropes in a very traditional but fast-changing society. I recently read and reviewed this short piece by Indrapramit Das called *Kali_Na* that invites its reader into a unique but captivating world.,1595192319

books,"I wish when I was in high school, books were considered an art form used to discover something about ourselves and the world, as opposed to being an assignment to be completed by Friday. This is just me though, that’s how I felt about it but i’m sure many students out there probably feel the same. Let me tell you, read those books. I’m currently a college senior, and only recently started reading for leisure. The emotions that these books evoke while i’m reading is truly amazing, to the point where I find myself lying the book on my chest and relishing the messages that just pop out of the page. Books are a tool used to deepen ourselves and change the way we see the world around us, the authors of the past have so many great insights that I wish I appreciated earlier in my academic and personal life. Just do yourself a favor and read your Faulkner, Twain, Huxley, Sinclair, etc.

EDIT: Hey guys, after reading many of your comments, I realized I may have come off a bit strong in pushing what’s assigned to us in school. However, that wasn’t truly my intention. What I more or less meant to say is you should give the assigned readings a chance, because we may often overlook some good pieces of literature. With that, “try to read your Faulkner, Twain, Huxley, and Sinclair.” Also, I have nothing wrong with spark-notes, I shouldn’t have made that title. Spark-notes is a wonderful resource that definitely helps us better understand some really difficult reading material, but it should be a supplement and if you’re really really not enjoying the book, just spark-note the dang thing!","To my high schoolers out there: do yourself a favor, and read the books you’re assigned.

books,"I've been in a book club since 2014, along with my girlfriend (now wife) and two other couples that we've known since we were in university. Along the way we've gone through many changes - members of our book club have changed jobs, gotten married, had kids, etc. - but we've consistently found the time to meet every 4-6 weeks and discuss our latest book.

In our system, everyone takes a turn to set a book for everyone else to read. There's no voting and no vetoes; it's completely up to that person.  The advantage of this system is that everyone has to go outside their comfort zone, and read books from genres they wouldn't ordinarily read. The disadvantage is that sometimes you have to push through a book that you really don't enjoy - but even then, we find that everyone tends to learn something, or at least get some interesting ideas from the book.

Anyway, these are books we've read over the years:

books,"Hello! I recently have started trying to get into reading books in psychology and eastern philosophy. I’m trying to shift to reading books for information instead of relying on quick google searches or skimming through articles. I’m trying to challenge myself to read more books for the purpose of learning new information. However, I’ve noticed that a lot of the books that seem to have interesting subject matters at first (ex: The Problems of Philosophy, Games People Play, etc) just don’t seem to grab my attention enough to finish the book.  I typically end up not finishing the book bc I either don’t understand what the author is talking about at First and have to reread a sentence 5 times before moving forward which makes getting through the book take forever (and I usually end up not finishing) or I get overwhelmed by not knowing how I’m supposed to retain the information in the book just from reading and I put it down. Do you have any advice for how to get through non fiction books without becoming bored (fiction books are story based and a compelling story is usually what it takes to capture my attention)? Is it a mindset thing? Is it normal to not understand what the author is talking about immediately?

books,"One of the best books I've read so far, and that's saying a lot. While the scientific reasoning behind many things may not be sound (anything at all regarding philotes i.e), the book more than makes up for it through world-building, action, and plot. It brings so many concepts and worldviews and beliefs together that it is just exhilarating. The concept of genetic enslavement was rather interesting to read about. The people of Path were genetically enhanced to be more intelligent than any other human being, but had a specific gene engineering inside them that led them to believe in the power of the gods and that the gods spoke to them to keep them on their path, making them slaves to Congress. I like how the plant itself is named path, and how the tampered gene is an attempt to make everyone fall onto the designated path, but as the story ends, the planet goes on to forge its own path. We also see genetic enslavement in the form of the descolada. I find the entire concept to be dictatorial and bizarre, and also worrisome as it isn't that hard for something like that to be done irl.   


In terms of storytelling, Peter's return might just breathe back the intense action and absorbance of the first book into the series. It was definitely a huge surprise. However, the brilliance of Peter's return is equally matched by Novinha's stupidity. I mean, what was Novinha even doing? Why did she become a nun? While the dependence of every single character on mysterious religious power is troubling, as any advanced future society should've freed itself of the shackles of religious belief by then, what's even more disturbing is the big question: what happened to Jane? I take it she will be weakened, but what happens? The ending felt like a small calm before the storm, and I personally believe that this is great, as the next book heralds the arrival of the fleet, Peter's bid to destroy Congress, and the end of Ender's journey",my thoughts on Xenocide - Orson Scott Card,1595170578
