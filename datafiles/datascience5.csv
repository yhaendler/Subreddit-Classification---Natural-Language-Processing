datascience,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to decide between the following three Data Science / Analytics Masters programs. These programs are online and part time programs. Does anybody have knowledge about any of these programs that I should be taking in to account in my decision? For example, I've read that the Northwestern program is largely based on self reading the texts and less emphasis is placed on video lectures.

&amp;#x200B;

* [Northwestern Masters in Data Science](https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/curriculum-specializations.php)
* [Notre Dame Masters ACMS: Data Science](https://datascience.nd.edu/program/#curriculum)
* [Boston University Masters in Applied Data Analytics](https://www.bu.edu/met/programs/graduate/applied-data-analytics/)

I know these programs are really expensive but I am in a unique situation where the cost to me is free.

&amp;#x200B;

A little about me: I am a 29 year old working as a ""Data Scientist"" at a tech company (my title is data scientist but my responsibilities are more in line with a product analyst). I use a ton of SQL everyday with a little bit of R and Python sprinkled in there but I don't feel totally comfortable with R and Python. My undergrad was in non-quantitative major. I don't know much statistics or math beyond what they teach in an AP highschool statistics class or AP calculus class.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any insights you guys have from personal or friend experience, hiring/interviewing, etc. on which of these programs to choose.","Accepted to a few Data Science / Analytics Masters programs, any advice on which one to go with?",1579469874
datascience,"I'm currently a Manager of ""Analytics"" for a traditional media company. I'm also getting my MS in Analytics part time through an online program.

So first about my job and my career. I really have enjoyed working in product analytics. In my last job I was working for a mobile app and got to work closely with iOS/Android devs, data engineers, and data scientists. I learned an immense amount about tech and it was amazing. I was exposed to things like AWS S3, Athena query engine, ELK Stack, etc. And because I was constantly around engineers, I just learned a lot of random things about tech, like what are parquet files, JSON file format, accessing API endpoints, encryption hash methods, etc. I loved all of it.

After 2 years, I decided to leave the job because the pay wasn't the best. I managed to get a Manager role making 40% more in base salary. Unfortunately I let my pursuit of money blindside me. I ended up in a company that is not technical at all. I don't work with any engineers or technical people. The majority of my coworkers work in things like production, publicity, finance, etc. I feel extremely out of place. In addition, there is not a lot of technical work for me to do. Instead of analyzing, querying, building scripts, etc., I find myself building decks on high level business problems on non-Analytics projects, like building a long range strategic plan, customer loyalty program or building a Brand budget.

It's obvious to me that I should have quit this job a long time ago. I've been here about 1 year now and mentally I made the decision to quit 3 months in. However, things changed when I got accepted to my MS program. The MS program has been fairly time intensive. Grad school is no joke. One privilege of this job has been the ability to spend quite a bit of my work time doing school work. My current job may not be technical or analytical, but it affords me a lot of time to actually just do school work. This is an incredible perk that I don't think I would get anywhere else. But on the other hand, I'm not developing or growing my career. At the end of the day, I chose to get my MS to enhance my career. I thought a combination of grad school + job would help, but right now my job feels like an anchor dragging my development down.

What should I do? I want to continue growing in Analytics and Data Science. I will admit I don't think I'm technical enough to become a Data Scientist (hence why I'm doing the MS program), but I'd love to go back to a job like my last job where I'm working in a technical environment. If I could have it my way, I would be a Manager of Product Analytics or something.

Do you think I should just suck it up and tolerate my job until I finish grad school and use the free time to my advantage? Or do you think that is detrimental to career growth as experience triumphs academics and that I should look for another job ASAP?

My only concerns about starting another job is that there's a lot of risk and work involved. Starting a new job means you have to build up your credibility again. The first 6 months will be a lot of hard work to establish myself and rep and it can be difficult to manage on top of school. The other risk is I could run into a boss that is not supportive of me. I'm fortunate in my current role because my boss did his MBA part time while working, so he definitely allows me to operate at a less than 100% capacity. I may not necessarily get the same treatment if I go elsewhere.

Unfortunately with school, there is no compromise. I am trying to graduate ASAP by taking 2 classes per semester and I am only on my second semester. I still have another 2 years to go.",Should I look for a new job now or stick it through?,1579469690

Hope your all doing well,

I'm having a technical interview for a company in a couple days time and if I pass the interview I get the job and so as well as asking some friends for help I've turned to this subreddit for some advice too.

To provide some context the company does not require candidates to be experts in data - it is an entry level role.  Whilst you don't need to be an expert in programming languages a basic knowledge would be great which I do have in SQL and python (though very basic).  I initially thought it was DA role but after reciveing this email I believe it is more of an DS role. Unfortuntely they didnt provide any specific requirements on the original job advert it was just having a STEM degree and a bunch of soft skills so I need quite a bit of help for the technical interview.

The interview will last an hour where I will be given 15 minutes read a case study and prepare which will be followed by 15 minutes of discussion before repeating this for another case study. They have told me to consider the following in preparation for the interview:

* How would you visualise or describe insights found in data to a client?
   * For this point I plan on looking at different types of charts that I can create and what sort of data I require for these charts. Additionally I plan on gaining an understanding of common visualisation packages/modules for Python  &amp; BI tools like Tableau. Is there anything else I should do here? Have I misinterpreted this?  
* What sort of models would you use to predict certain behaviours or aid understanding?
   * Here I believe I need to show an understanding of predictive analytics and unfortunately I don't know too much about it. I plan on learning about decision trees and ANNs, What other common models should I consider for this point? 
* How would you work with infrastructures i.e. cloud to work with millions (and even billions) of data points?
   * I think here I need to show appreciation of data warehousing so would this be tools like Spark, Hadoop, GoogleCloudPlatform, AWS and maybe even Pandas? Have I misinterpreted this?  Is there anything else I should consider here?
* How you would build frameworks to collate different data sources and bring into one place?
   * I don't know what to do here. I'm not sure whether the point here is to show an understanding of data governance when working with numerous datasets or how you would collate the data by using things like relational databases? Could someone provide some insight or tips for this? How is this done in industry?

They have said they are looking to see how I use data, my programming langauge use/knowledge, how I would fit into the team and my ***potential.***

datascience,"Hello,

Before I even start, I want to say that I am very open to the possibility that I'm just prejudiced, or that I'm missing some vital piece of information, or that I've just never been exposed to the kind of environment where spreadsheets would be the best choice. So, this is not an attack on spreadsheet software - it may well be that my understanding is incomplete.

Having said that, I have been wondering for a long time: why use Excel, or any other type of spreadsheet? I've been working with data for years, and I still haven't found a single use case that made me stop and think ""*ahh, Excel is just the right tool for this job*"". I've never done anything in Excel that I couldn't have done far more efficiently in Python, and the only times I ever use it are when some stakeholder (usually management or financial people) specifically requests it. The only advantage I can think of is that an Excel file is a self contained entity which may include multiple datasets and charts, and that makes for easy sharing via email, but that's it. So far, the most convincing explanation I've heard for Excel's popularity is that ""most people don't know any better"", but as someone who has taught Python to people with no prior programming knowledge, I find that difficult to understand - I have seen people go from zero to Pandas in a few hours, it really is not rocket science.

So my question is: are there any scenarios where Excel or one of its equivalents really is the ""right tool for the job""? Or do we keep using it simply for historical reasons?",What are Excel/spreadsheet's use cases?,1579445535
datascience,"Hey guys, hope you're doing well.   
I've got a bachelor's in CS, but my GPA is only slightly over 2.5. I spent most of my uni life trying to figure out what I wanted to do (first I thought mechanical, then switched to CS, thought I would focus on app development, then switched to machine learning). By the time I decided I want to get into data science, I was already in my final year. I wasn't very enthusiastic about my courses until then, and looking back on it now, I feel like I wasted most of my time (instead of thoroughly focusing on important concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and statistics).

During my final year, I took some courses on NLP, machine learning, and computer vision. I also was doing some part-time work with SQL and web scraping for a startup. When I had free time, I took some Coursera and Udemy courses on topics like Python, SQL, Spark, R, etc. I even worked on a group final year project, which was recognised as one of the best projects that year. Once I graduated, I started working full-time at the startup as an ""associate data scientist"", and over the past two years I've been working with data pipelining, some machine learning, and databases. Even now I feel guilty from time to time about the time I wasted in university, especially when core programming topics are discussed at work.

Now, I have learnt my lesson, and have also decided that I want to specialise in data science. I really want to work with music data, particularly for music recommendation. I have accepted the mistakes I made in university, learned from them, and am willing to work hard if I get a second chance at school. But considering my low GPA, I'm very skeptical about whether I even have options at this point.

Do you think there's any hope for someone like me to become successful in data science? If so, do you have any suggestions or advice on how I can go about this given my situation? I am really willing to do anything I can to get into a master's programme so that I can give myself a second chance.

I am currently taking a regression course and am a bit confused by MSE.

MSE seems to be commonly defined as SSE/n, which I've seen in Introduction to Statistical Learning by James et al. and Applied Predictive Modeling by Kuhn. However, in my class and the assigned textbook (Applied Linear Statistical Models by Kutner et al.) it is defined as SSE/(n-p); so for instance, the denominator is n-2 for simple linear regression. As described in Kutner et al., SSE has n-p degrees of freedom, and using this denominator gives an unbiased estimator for the population common variance. My professor noted that the n divisor in the other books might come from a maximum likelihood estimate. I found in the R caret documentation they explain: ""Note that many models have more predictors (or parameters) than data points, so the typical mean squared error denominator (n - p) does not apply.""

Could someone shed some light on the differences?

Which calculation for MSE is more commonly used in practice? It appears that MSE = mean(SSE) is commonly used in data science nowadays (and this seems to be the default in popular packages such as caret and scikit-learn).

datascience,"Hi,

I had  the data science onsite interview at Facebook onsite. As some of you may know the onsite consists of four interviews each one taking half an hour and the categories for me were:

1. Technical analysis
2. Product Interpretation
3. Applied data
4. Quantitative analysis

I had the interviews in that order. I think I nailed all the interviews except the first one which was basically SQL exercises. There were 3 exercises, the first two I completed but the last one I got stuck and although I was heading in the right direction I could not finish. Do you guys think that I blew my chance at an offer for not completing this? I keep rewinding it in my head. Any input would be appreciated.

datascience,"Hey all,

Looking for some advice - I’ve been set a project to define churn in an e-commerce business. I’ve only ever calculated churn in scenarios where users have a fixed subscription end date so this is a new one for me.

The data points I have, are individual transaction timestamps, transaction amounts, timestamps when the customer interacted with the site and the timestamp when the customer first set up an account.

The questions I’ve been asked are:
1. Define an appropriate churn metric for such a business
2. Explain how the business can measure said churn metric with minimal delay and skewness in the data.

I’ve got a few ideas for the first part namely:
1. Define an appropriate window in time (7,14,30 days) and look at how many users don’t return within said window from their last transaction.
2. Look at rolling average spend and see if a users falls by a defined parameter i.e. halves over 30days

What I’m struggling with is how to define appropriate cohorts for the second part - I’m not sure how’d you go about defining windows to ensure you don’t skew the data? I assume there would always be some skew from macro trends like seasonality.

Any ideas/thoughts would be very much appreciated!",Defining cohorts in an e-commerce churn analysis,1579315668

datascience,"TLDR; interviewing for a data scientist role in 6ish months and trying to improve my skills in ML, stats, Python. Please recommend the best resources!  
I currently work at a FAANG company and am working with my manager on a transition plan into a data scientist role. If all goes well, I should have an interview loop within 6-8 months. Last year I completed a data science certification program from a university that taught me some of the basics of ML and Python. Given the high bar for data scientists at my company, I'm looking for resources to learn data science at a more granular level.   
I'm not looking for courses like Andrew Ng's introduction to deep learning or anything about AI, computer vision, NLP, or academic topics in ML.   
Preferably looking for resources (courses/blogs/YouTube channels/subreddits) that will teach intermediate to advanced applied machine learning. Algorithm selection, advanced parameter tuning, interpretation of results, etc. The closest things I've found are articles on specific topics, like this one on [XGBoost](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/10/xgboost-concise-technical-overview.html), that really get into the nitty gritty of the algorithm.   
My team currently uses time series forecasting, classification, clustering, recommender systems, etc. We don't use neural networks much as far as I know, but that could change. The other data scientists on the team work in Python and R.  
Here's where I put my skills inventory: 

* Python: Intermediate, familiar with basic packages for data manipulation, ML and stats. I have very little experience with R, so I figure I should just double down on Python rather than diversify. 
* SQL: Strong.
* Statistics: Basic knowledge of probability theory, distributions, significance tests. Probably my weakest area since I was not required to take any hardcore stats in Uni.
* Data Visualization: Good not great, I have working knowledge of Tableau and have used visualization packages like Seaborn/Pyplot/Graphviz
* Scala, Hadoop, Spark, SAS: No real knowledge of these, not sure if the team I am interested in uses them. 

Based on this, what resources do you recommend and how can I build a self study plan?

* BA in Biological Anthropology 3.7 GPA
* Four years of professional experience in the Financial industry. 
* Two years as a Workforce Planner &amp; Analyst and every day data use.

What I am looking for is a MS in Data Analytics, Data Science, or Business Intelligence to advance my career prospects. I currently use blends of time series models to forecast demand at my company. There is also large desire for more use of Python and Tableau. 

My company will pay for my education, but cap around $10,000 per year, so excess comes out of my pocket. Additionally, my program must be ‘approved’ by my employer, so there isn’t much flexibility from the programs mentioned above.

I would like to finish in within 2 years or less. I also have not taken the GMAT [yet]. 


Program Criteria:
* Must be online.
* Must not exceed a total cost of ~$30,000 or ~$1,000 per credit (roughly).
* Courses in Python, Machine Learning, Big Data, and/or Predictive Analytics preferred. 
* Not having to take the GMAT would be a nice to have, but I’m happy to take it if the right program requires it.

I’ve sifted through many of the “Top x amount of analytics schools in 2018, 19, 20, etc.” They are either wildly wrong with cost estimate, contain outdated program information, and seem to lack simple filters/criteria.

datascience,"I am currently completing my last semester in obtaining a BS in chemistry. My degree is very limited in what I can do  and how much I can make. I don't have a passion for it and cannot see myself working in the field for long. The one thing I did enjoy in studying chemistry was definitely the analytics, being able to take raw data and making it into something meaningful. After doing research for a while, I feel like data science is the right fit for me.

I want to make a career change but don't know the best way of doing so in terms of time, money, and educational value. I have a job lined up post graduation 65-70K a year in a lab but would wanna pursue data science. So far I see a few options:

1) Continue my bachelors and being a double major, taking an extra 1-1.5 years.

2) Obtaining my masters at a different school (online or on campus)

3) Go to a data science boot camp, although I've heard there is a bad stigma around it

I am currently trying to advance my skills with online resources but I feel this is a long and difficult road to employment. If I take this route will it hinder my future possibilities even after getting in the field?

So looking at big companies who have a dozen of datascientists working for them (too low compared to what kind of IT specialists they have in total) and a lot of big companies who even doesn't see the benefit of DStists,  it looks like there is not much work for the overhyped datascience community.

Of course if you see this as an opportunity (instead of a problem), it could also mean that companies are sleeping. So with a new startup you could also have a leverage with datascience and create amazing products what could put them out of business.

At the risk of getting roasted, I'd like to ask a question and figured this was the best place to do it.  I don't presume myself to be a data scientist, I know there are people who have worked very hard to get degrees on the subject.

I'm self-taught in SQL, but I only write queries and use BI tools. With that being said I'm fairly confident I could stay up all night binging Harry Potter, and easily pass a test consisting of joins, subqueries, where/having/case statements, json objects etc.

I'm applying for a new job and sometimes seeing experienced with ETL and data pipelines as desired or preferred. I skipped the chapter on creating tables since I didn't have permission for that in my last role, but (1) the syntax seemed fairly simple? (2) technically anyone could use a tool called cyberduck to finagle a table into existence, which I did as needed. 

I guess I am hoping to find out (1) if it is worth mentioning that I know how you would go about creating a table in an interview (i.e. I know the syntax), (2) if it might be nonconsequential since I am otherwise SQL literate and therefore could easily learn this skill on the job, (3) if it is a distinct and significant skillset to the point of omg-go-take-a-udemy **right now** sort of thing.
