books,"My wife has been reading the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich (she is on book 13 right now) and on occasion she will take note of reused character names. The most common one seems to be ""Ziggy."" It feels like there have been at least 7 different characters named Ziggy so far, none related to each other in any way. No characters mention how odd it is that there are 7 different Ziggys in town.

This seems like a very strange (bad) writing choice that I've never personally encountered. How do these novels keep succeeding with such lazy writing? I'm tempted to pick them up myself just to make a chart explaining all the Ziggy. If someone could explain them to me, that would save me a lot of trouble. 

Are there any other examples of authors overusing character names like this?

books,"I've been in the mood for Virginia Woolf lately! Two weeks ago, I finished A Room of One's Own and mostly loved it. Woolf's personality really drew me in. 

Immediately after that, I read Mrs. Dalloway, which I also enjoyed, although I'll need to reread it to take it all in. I really liked the stream-of-consciousness style despite it being difficult to read, and I found that she put things into words that I've never been able to describe myself. She's very perceptive and, on top of that, very eloquent. She notices all the important - albeit little - details of daily life.

I started reading Orlando: A Biography yesterday, and I'm finding it very interesting and engaging so far. It seems quite different from Mrs. Dalloway. I really appreciate Woolf's ability to experiment with her writing, and I'm definitely planning on reading most (if not all) of her work at some point.

Fantastic, would be the only way I could describe Sarah J Maas‚Äô latest novel, Crescent City. 
Crime, love, magic, danger...there is something for everyone in this book. Maas‚Äô storytelling has a way of ripping your heart out one minute then mending it together so beautifully the next it leaves the reader speechless. Her main character, Bryce, has been solidified as one of my favorite characters of all time. Despite how flawed she is, Bryce‚Äôs spirit, willingness to forgive, and loyalty to those she loves was amazing to read. The relationships are what made this story for me. The deep love the friendships possessed were so profoundly moving it drove the story home. Seriously, I was ugly crying at probably three different points in this book. The world itself is so unique with hints of real world things through out, it made the story that much more enjoyable. A very captivating story of just how powerful love truly is. I cannot wait for books two and three. Sarah J. Maas is simply brilliant. 
Huge disclaimer:

What is bothering me is - it is a time turner! Since they already know what happened in the past, why limit to just turning it back 3 hours? They can turn it back 6 hours or heck even 24 hours or a week ahead - they can go to Hagrid's house and get Scabbers out of there and lock him up. They can then just search and approach the black dog using their invisibility cloak. 

Also, why are they making a big deal out of going to the hospital on time? If they are not able to make it, just go back 10 mins and get into the hospital? Or if the time turner can only turn back in hourly increments, then go back andhour, wait outside and just go in 5 minutes before?

Can white authors write Black protagonists? Can straight authors write gay protagonists? Etc. It's not an entirely unreasonable question, given the prominence of the #ownvoices movement, and the intense backlash some authors have faced for writing allegedly inaccurate or insensitive portrayals.

For a long time, one popular response has been: Yes, because that's ultimately what fiction *is*. When Zadie Smith wrote about the subject, for example, she titled her essay ""[Fascinated to Presume: In Defense of Fiction](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/10/24/zadie-smith-in-defense-of-fiction/)"", and wrote things such as:
&gt;it would be easy enough at this point to march onward and write a triumphalist defense of fiction, ridiculing those who hold the very practice in suspicion‚Äîthe type of reader who wonders how a man wrote Anna Karenina

In short, ""writing the other"" is not just one kind of fiction, it *is* fiction. If we weren't allowed to write about people who are different from ourselves, the only thing left would be self-inserts, memoirs, autobiography, etc. Which, *obviously*, would be unthinkable.

And yet... along comes autofiction. It's as if the literary fiction community heard that *reductio ad absurdum* argument and decided to choose the absurd future where fiction itself comes to an end.

Am I wrong to make this connection? Maybe I'm being overly cynical, but it seems to me that the rise in popularity of autofiction has nothing to do with literary merit and everything to do with the political climate.

I read that and actually enjoyed it more than the original Twilight. Beau was a lot more fun than Bella. And Edythe was less of a miserable b*tch comapred to Edward. 

Then once I had read and googled everything I got my boyfriend to watch all the films with me. 

And now, I'm done. There is not single piece of Twilight I can read or watch. And I don't know what to do with myself.

I feel numb and confused and sad. And it's not just this series, I do it all the time with other series and things. I binge them, don't sleep or eat or anything until I've finished each book or whatever.

Then once I finish one, I have a nap or snack and then continue. I read midnight sun 4 days ago. Then obviously moved onto the twilight series as normal. Then life and death. Then the film's. All in 4 days. 

Does anybody else get like that or am I just a freak hahaha I'm genuinely curious If books affect other people this way",Book depression,1598284072

books,"I'm really sorry if this is a stupid question but it's something I think about a lot and would be interested in hearing others' thoughts about it. Hopefully my question makes sense, it's a little hard for to explain.

I'm the kind of person (a perfectionist) who really wants to understand everything I read in a book (such as allusions to other works or historical context, that kind of thing) and so when I read a book I always try to get an annotated version. It's been a long time since I've actually read something with annotations though and so when I picked up ""Lolita"" to reread it, I found myself getting a little frustrated with flipping from the front to the back where the annotations are every few lines.

I was just wondering how others utilize annotations when they read. Do you read and then when you see an annotated line flip to the back to check out the notes? Or maybe there's some other way of going about this? My other question is, how do you utilize annotations when they're given in the back but the lines in the book aren't marked with any numbers (so you aren't able to tell which lines have annotations)?",Annotated Editions,1598280258

books,"Despite always wanting to finish books and seek out new works, I‚Äôve never been much of a reader.

It‚Äôs hard for me to read sometimes because I form obsessions about making sure I‚Äôve understood **everything** that I read on the page. (OCD) 

I‚Äôve recently started reading Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton and I‚Äôm really enjoying it. It feels different than other times I‚Äôve started books. The other times it felt mostly like I was just reading so that I could say that I finished a book. So I would pick something that was suppose to be good and tried to read it. 

With this it‚Äôs different. I actually feel more interested and compelled by Crichton‚Äôs writing. I feel a connection to the author. But the actual act of reading still feels a little difficult. Sometimes finishing 3 pages feel like I have been lifting weights with my brain.

I should preface by saying I do understand why the book and movie couldn't be exactly alike. I believe that to license all the different music and movie pieces they would have needed to recreate the book would have likely been too expensive to be worth the risk. 

However, this movie had none of the fun of the book. The book was one of the few I couldn't stop reading. I'd stay up late and wake up early to read this book. I was dying to see how the puzzles would play out, to see Parzivals fortness and them working through some of these quests.
