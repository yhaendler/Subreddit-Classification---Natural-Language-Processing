books,"Ok, so I just wanted to ask a few questions about the series (Stalking Jack The Ripper by Kerri Maniscalco) before I start reading. I'm one of those (rare) readers who don't mind, and actually prefer, spoilers. I like to know what is going to happen during a book so I don't get bored or get my literal heart broken when something sad happens.

I really want to read the series so here are the questions I need answers for:

1. Is there any romance in the first book, and if not when does it begin?
2. Is Thomas a big character in the first book?
3. I get that the books are kinda murder mystery centred and can be a little gory, but are they super dark character wise? (I don't want to read any depressing or sad books.)
4. Also, does the series end on a positive note?
5. Are Thomas and Audrey the only characters that stick around? Like do they have any side character friends?

books,"When I was younger, I would get punished by having TV and computer taken away. All that was left to entertain me was books. I have read plenty of different genre books. Because of this, my family would always buy me books for gifts (thanks for the 2 ton library family). When I grew older, the books matured with me. One day, they sent me a box filled with Jack books. (Jack Reacher - Lee Child, and Jack Daniels - J.A. Konrath) Apparently, it was a happy accident. I read through the Jack Reacher books, and decided I might as well give Jack Daniels a try.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started reading the first book, I instantly fell in love with Konrath's style. I couldn't help but become invested in every character he introduced. He crafted a perfectly imperfect female detective protagonist. He was able to keep out the normal tropes where either woman are powerless and weak compared to the men, or exceedingly strong and all the men are idiots in comparison. He kept the dynamic very realistic.

&amp;#x200B;

The villains are clever. Romance does not overtake the story, but does exist to keep things interesting and to further the plot. The twists are not M. Night level, generally not predictable, but there are absolutely clues along the way if you are the type of person, like me, who enjoys solving the mystery before the end of the book. The comedy is gold. Whenever a book can make me physically laugh out loud, and often, along with everyone who I've lent the book to, you know you got a keeper. The humor is just icing on the cake though, because it doesn't detract from the seriousness of the stories.

&amp;#x200B;

To finish off my post, let me add the probably most interesting and unique aspect. Each book in the Jack Daniels series is named after a drink (Shot of Tequila, Whiskey Sour, Bloody Mary, Rusty Nail, etc.) along with a description in the front of how the drink is made. More often than not, he manages to squeeze in the drink somewhere in the story which is a nice little extra detail that more writers should attempt to do in mysteries.

&amp;#x200B;

So. Have you read any of the Jack Daniels books? If you have, do you like them as much as I do? Based on my post, if you haven't read or even heard of them, are you interested enough to read them yourself?

books,"I just finished *I am Legend* and I was pondering it the morning after when it all kind of fell into place in my head. I read it mostly as a straightforward apocalypse novel, man attempting to survive in a world gone mad, the struggles of his daily life, very akin to the harshness of survival that a book like *Hatchet* might explore.

Even when I read the titular final sentence of the book, I accepted it as a poignant but somehow unfleshed concept. However recalling Neville's arc and how he came into his own, as well as how the 'new society' acted put it into perspective for me.

The pervailing theme of I Am Legend is that Neville is an anachronism stuck in the past (duh). He starts in despair with no feeling of recourse in the world, unintentionally creating his own museum exhibit of a dead world, complete with knowledge, arts and libations, constantly harassed by reminders of his wife and the howls of his former-colleague-turned-vampire. It is only when he begins to hope to 'fix' the world back to how it was that he regains hope, cuts down his drinking and smoking etc. however this is largely fruitless.

It culminates with Neville in his element, finally resigned to the world he is facing that he comes into his own, stronger, more resilient to his lifestyle and a true danger to the infected. He began to hunt his former colleague, the one baying for his blood every evening, as a form of recreation, he is taking joy in a manifestation of this 'new world'. He is no longer mentally stuck in the past, no longer yearning for companionship or sexual release. This former inability to live in the present was tipified by keeping his wife in a glass coffin, a sealed reminder of the world he lost and yearned to return to.

This changes however when he is confronted by a 'normal' infected, part of a new group of vampires who do not live the animal life of the regular infected. They come for him in the night, brutally killing the vampires outside of his home, peaking when they riddled his former colleague (his only remaining attachment to the old-world) with bullets, driving a final stake through his heart. This savagery is familiar to him, their cars, weapons, affectations all familiar to \*his\* old-world but starkly different in the sense that he is fundamentally alien from this new group, he is the remaining 'human'.

His last spoken words to 'Ruth', the first new-vampire he came across, were a plead to not let the brutality of the old world stay with their new society, the brutality of \*his\* world. This was powerful because it was a condemnation of his old world and lifestyle, an understanding of the change he had struggled against for years.

Neville has two sudden realizations towards the end of the book. First, that the plague, like other bacteria, can \*mutate\*. He never considered the fact that these vampires could change, never considered the fact that the world \*could\* be anything but a shadow of the world lost to him. He was so focused on *him* and his ideals being the last vestige of value. He was completely obstinant to this fact and his lifestyle up to that point had been indicative of it. The generators, the music, the books, alcohol, it was merely the trappings of a bygone era he refused to let go of (the fact that this was published in *1954* is telling).

Secondly, In his execution by forced suicide, Neville takes a lethal medication and looks out to the gathered group of this new society below, he reflected that they view him as he viewed the vampires, he is seen as a villain, a freak, a living legend of a dark-creature which comes to kill them and their children as they sleep.

I think that the full realization of how this theme was executed hit me so hard because my only exposure to the story was the 2007 movie adaptation by the same name. This movie had such a shallow interpretation of Neville, the dog, his lifestyle. It ended completely contrary to the book, the 'good guys' survive and a cure for the infection is safely delivered to a remaining outpost of humans (I'm familiar with the alternate ending where he hands back the patient to the vampire mob but I don't think this is anywhere near equivalent to the impact or point of the book).

I think the funniest thing about all of this is that my copy of the book is one of those whose cover advertises the new movie adaptation, it has a full spread of *Will Smith* walking stoically through a backdrop of a dust covered city, rifle in-hand.

As someone who is really not any sort of prolific reader, I think I understand better the complete frustration when it comes to those who appreciate the source material being presented with an adaptation that really misses the mark. Book to movie adaptations can enrich the source material and even make it better (*Fight Club* comes to mind) but it takes work and real chops, something the vast majority of Hollywood isn't interested in pursuing.

Outside of the cockpit, no one on board would notice the small movement. But over the course of a journey across the country, the impact of the change would be considerable, and the confused passengers would alight from their plane in Washington, DC, not New York.

We don‚Äôt notice tiny changes, because their immediate impact is negligible. Actually if you can get 1% better each day for 1 year, you‚Äôll end up 73 times better by the time you‚Äôre done. Conversely, if you get 1% worse each day for one year, you‚Äôll decline nearly down to zero.

The task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.

If you want better results, focus on building good systems. Goals are the results you want to achieve. Systems are the processes that lead to those results. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.

Winners and losers have the same goals. What separates winners from losers is the system of continuous small improvements that the winners implement which help them to achieve their goal.

Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. In order to provide permanent solutions to problems, you need to solve them at the systems level and not at the results level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

**What are habits?**

Toward the end of the 19thcentury, Edward Thorndike, a psychologist, conducted experiments with cats to study how learning takes place and how habits are formed. From his studies, Thorndike discovered that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated, and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.

When you find a rewarding act, the brain catalogs it and reminds you to repeat it at a later time. Eventually, a habit is formed out of it.

Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else.

**Here‚Äôs how habits work**

The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Finally, the response delivers a reward.

The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes:

‚Ä¢ To satisfy us

‚Ä¢ To teach us

If behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Without the first three steps, the behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.

We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. Cue and Craving are the problem phase while Response and Reward are the solution phase.

The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are:

‚Ä¢ Make it obvious

‚Ä¢ Make it attractive

‚Ä¢ Make it easy

‚Ä¢ Make it satisfying

# 1) Make it obvious

All of us have cues that trigger certain habits. The buzz of your phone, for example, is a cue to check your messages.

And once you understand that certain stimuli can prompt habitual behavior, you can use this knowledge to change your habits. How? Well, one way is to change your surroundings and general environment to encourage better habits.

Just take the work of Boston-based doctor Anne Thorndike. She wanted to improve her patients‚Äô dietary habits without requiring them to make a conscious decision. How did she pull this off? She had the hospital cafeteria rearranged. Originally, the refrigerators next to the cash registers contained only soda. Thorndike introduced water, not only there, but at every other drink station. Over three months, soda sales dropped by 11 percent, while water sales shot up by 25 percent. People were making healthier choices, just because the cue to drink water rather than soda was more prominent.

So simple changes to our environment can make a big difference. Want to practice guitar? Leave the instrument out in the center of the room. Trying to eat healthier snacks? Leave them out on the counter, instead of in the salad drawer. Make your cues as obvious as possible, and you‚Äôll be more likely to respond to them.

A second great way to strengthen cues is to use *implementation intentions.*

Most of us tend to be too vague about our intentions. We say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to eat better,‚Äù and simply hope that we‚Äôll follow through. An implementation intention introduces a clear plan of action, setting out when and where you‚Äôll carry out the habit you‚Äôd like to cultivate. And research shows that it works.

A study of voters in the United States found that the citizens who were asked the questions ‚ÄúAt what time will you vote?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow will you get to the voting station?‚Äù were more likely to actually turn out than those who were just asked *if* they would vote. ¬†

So don‚Äôt just say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll run more often.‚Äù Say, ‚ÄúOn Monday, Wednesday and Friday, when the alarm goes off, the first thing I‚Äôll do is don my running gear and clock two miles.‚Äù Then leave your running shoes out where you‚Äôll see them. You‚Äôll be giving yourself both a clear plan and an obvious cue, and it may surprise you how much easier this will make it to actually build a positive running habit.

# 2) Make it attractive

In 1954, neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner ran an experiment to test the neurology of desire. Using electrodes, they blocked the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in rats. To their surprise, the rats simply lost the will to live. They had no desire to eat, drink, reproduce or do anything else. Mere days later, they all died of thirst.

The human brain releases dopamine, a hormone that makes us feel good, when we do pleasurable things such as eating or having sex. But we also get a hit of feel-good dopamine when we simply *anticipate* those pleasurable activities. It‚Äôs the brain‚Äôs way of driving us onward and encouraging us to actually do things. So, in the brain‚Äôs reward system, desiring something is on par with getting something, which goes a long way toward explaining why kids enjoy the anticipation of Christmas so much. It‚Äôs also why daydreaming about your upcoming hot date is so pleasurable.

We can also turn this knowledge to our advantage when trying to form habits. If we make a habit something we look forward to, we‚Äôll be much more likely to follow through and actually do it.

A great technique for this is *temptation bundling.* That‚Äôs when you take a behavior that you think of as important but unappealing and link it to a behavior that you‚Äôre drawn to ‚Äì one that will generate that motivating dopamine hit.

Ronan Byrne, an engineering student in Ireland, knew he should exercise more, but he got little enjoyment from working out. However, he did enjoy watching Netflix. So he hacked an exercise bike, connecting it to his laptop and writing code that would only allow Netflix to run if he was cycling at a certain speed. By linking exercise ‚Äì literally ‚Äì to a behavior that he was naturally drawn to, he transformed a distasteful activity into a pleasurable one.

You don‚Äôt need to be an engineer to apply this to your life. If you *need* to work out, but you *want* to catch up on the latest A-list gossip, you could commit to only reading magazines while at the gym. If you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales calls, promise yourself a half hour of ESPN after you talk to your tenth prospect. Soon enough, you may even find those unattractive tasks enjoyable, since you‚Äôll be anticipating a pleasing reward while carrying them out.

# 3) Make it easy

We often spend a lot of time on behaviors that are easy. Scrolling through social media, for example, takes zero effort, so it‚Äôs easy for it to fill up lots of our time. Doing a hundred push-ups or studying Mandarin Chinese, in contrast, requires a lot of effort. Repeating *those* behaviors daily until they become habitual is tough.

So making behaviors as easy as possible is key to turning them into habits. Luckily, there are a few tricks we can embrace to make anything seem easier. The first is to focus on *reducing friction*.

The author has always been hopeless at sending greeting cards, while his wife never fails to do so. Why? Well, she keeps a box of greeting cards at home, presorted by occasion, making it easier to send congratulations or condolences or whatever is called for. Since she doesn‚Äôt have to go out and buy a card when someone gets married or has an accident, there‚Äôs no friction involved in sending one.

You can also use this approach to *increase* friction for bad habits. If you want to waste less time in front of the TV, unplug it and take the batteries out of the remote. Doing so will introduce enough friction to ensure you only watch when you really want to.

The second trick for making a habit easier in the long term is the *two-minute rule*, a way to make any new activity feel manageable. The principle is that any activity can be distilled into a habit that is doable within two minutes. Want to read more? Don‚Äôt commit to reading one book every week ‚Äì instead, make a habit of reading two pages per night. Want to run a marathon? Commit to simply putting on your running gear every day after work.

The two-minute rule is a way to build easily achievable habits, and those can lead you on to greater things. Once you‚Äôve pulled on your running shoes, you‚Äôll probably head out for a run. Once you‚Äôve read two pages, you‚Äôll likely continue. The rule recognizes that simply getting started is the first and most important step toward doing something.

# 4) Make it satisfying

In the 1990s, public health researcher Stephen Luby, working in the neighborhood of Karachi, Pakistan, achieved a huge 52-percent reduction in diarrhea among the local children. Pneumonia rates dropped by 48 percent, and skin infections by 35 percent. Luby‚Äôs secret? Nice soap.

Luby had known that handwashing and basic sanitation were essential to reducing illness. The locals understood this, too; they just weren‚Äôt turning their knowledge into a habit. Everything changed when Luby worked with Proctor and Gamble to introduce a premium soap into the neighborhood for free. Overnight, handwashing became a satisfying experience. The new soap lathered easily and smelled delightful. Suddenly, everyone was washing their hands, because it was now a pleasing activity.

The final and most important rule for behavioral change is to make habits satisfying.

This can be difficult, for evolutionary reasons. Today, we live in what academics call a *delayed-return environment.* You turn up at the office today, but the return ‚Äì a paycheck ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt come until the end of the month. You go to the gym in the morning, but you don‚Äôt lose weight overnight.

Our brains, though, evolved to cope with the *immediate-return environment* of earlier humans, who weren‚Äôt thinking about long-term returns like saving for retirement or sticking to a diet. They were focused on immediate concerns like finding their next meal, seeking shelter and staying alert enough to escape any nearby lions.

Immediate returns can encourage bad habits, too. Smoking may give you lung cancer in 20 years, but, in the moment, it relieves your stress and the craving for nicotine, which means you may ignore the long-term effects and indulge in a cigarette.

So when you are pursuing habits with a delayed return, try to attach some immediate gratification to them.

For example, a couple the author knows wanted to eat out less, cook more, get healthier and save money. To do so, they opened a savings account called ‚ÄúTrip to Europe,‚Äù and every time they avoided a meal out, transferred $50 to it. The short-term satisfaction of seeing $50 land in that savings account provided the immediate gratification they needed to keep them on track for the ultimate, longer-term reward. ¬†",Atomic Habits Summary (The 4 Rules of Behavioral Change),1613752180

I have read as much as I can find online about The Tennessee Children's scandal and Georgia Tann (seriously, look it up. It won't spoil the book). I can't believe this book is based on a true story from ONLY 70 years ago. This woman-Georgia Tann-would kidnap babies and young children from poor families, change their names and birth dates, and adopt them to rich and influential families as desirable children from good backgrounds. She would lie about their backgrounds and their parents and get over a thousand dollars a child. Over 25 years she sold over 5,000 kids and over 500 of those were either killed or died of neglect. She made over 11 million dollars in today's money. I love historical fiction but I had no idea this had ever happened. The book is incredible.

books,"A few months ago, I read The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett.  


I think it's brilliant pulp fiction. However, there is a bit of bigotry in the book. The author does tend to portray women as just 2D characters, which I kind of find offensive. Then again, it makes perfect sense as it was published in like the 30s or 40s. Brigid O'Shaughnessy seemed like a child at times, with her childish tantrums and all. There is another character in the book, Joel Cairo, who is also not represented properly. This is probably because he is &gt;!gay.!&lt;   


The supporting characters in the book aren't really that memorable anyway. Samuel Spade is pretty cool, because he is like an archetypical tough guy detective. Hammett is a good pulp fiction writer too, up there with Raymond Chandler imo. I'd say that the most archetypical tough guy detectives are Continental Op and Phillip Marlowe (Hammett and Chandler's OC respectively). All in all, it plays out like a quintessential pulp fiction. I don't mean that as a bad thing, it's just that it was pretty good imo. I wasn't really a fan of the backstory behind the Maltese Falcon. However, it is a classic in the sense that it established a lot of tropes of the pulp fiction/hardboiled crime genre, and I do respect that.   


Oh and also, before I forget, the movie featuring Humphrey Bogart is pretty good too. I watched that first before reading the book. It's pretty faithful to the book. I liked the movie better than the book though, probably because the film is *classic noire*.
