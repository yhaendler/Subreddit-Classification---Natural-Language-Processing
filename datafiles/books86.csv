books,"I was recently diagnosed and treated for ADHD, and this is the first book I’ve finished on my own accord since 8th grade! I liked it a lot, and it feels so good to FINALLY be back into reading for pleasure again. I thought the beginning was a bit slow, but I think I feel that way about most older books. This is the main motivation for this post, just very happy to have rediscovered my love of reading :D

The way Plath describes mental illness in such an intimate (I think this is the right word), yet chillingly cold way is incredible. The writing just feels so.. close? The “cold” I’m talking about is apathy I believe - just like a blunt, open, mental illness. It feels like The Bell Jar “says the quiet part out loud” so to speak. I can’t get over how cool it is that the story *feels* so close, yet everything is just so.. disconnected? Alienated? I think what I’m describing is the divorce between the mood and tone of the book, but I am very open to being corrected if that’s not the case :)

books,"Hello. I have a question: Has Goodreads ever deleted reviews before?

I wanted to ask because, when looking through books that I read in the past, there was one book that I left a review for. I won't name the book or the author to not cause any controversy, but it was a book that I read a few years ago when in college. I thought it was fine, overall, but I had my criticisms. I didn't say anything that was offensive or anything like that about the book.

A few years later into the present, however, I find that the review for the book was gone. And I was confused, because I don't recall deleting the review. And this was written by an author that I've read in the past. On top of that, two other books that I've read by them, I left reviews about the books, too, and they're still up. 

Has this ever happened to anyone before? A review that you wrote getting deleted? Even when it was tame compared to other reviews on Goodreads? I'm just curious about it, is all. And if has happened, is there a reason why? Because, you would think that a site like Goodreads would allow people to state their thoughts on any or all books.

Thank you!",Goodreads and Deleted Reviews,1614898400

books,"As a grown person reading this, I was devastated for Ender throughout, especially at the end. One lingering question: can anyone help me understand Valentine a little better? At first, she seemed like the central force of goodness and empathy in the story. But then she transformed a bit as she got older, and even mentioned becoming more like Demosthenes as she wrote him, and enjoying her power. To me, Ender's ""escape"" from the games of the grown-ups to the buggers' old planet wasn't freedom at all, as Valentine seemingly manipulated him into going. Ender has never really had a choice in his life, in my opinion. As an older sister with a close relationship with my younger brother, their entire arc was just completely heartbreaking (I can't speak as much to Peter's). Any comments on their dynamic would be much appreciated. It was a stunning book.","Finished Ender's Game recently, as an adult. Just...wow.",1614897568

books,"At the beginning of 2021, I told myself that this is MY year and that I am going to conquer it and make massive changes in my life. 

Two of the things I told myself that I was going to make changes on and improve in were Meditation and Reading. 

So of course I googled best self-help books or books for life improvement, whatever you want to call them. And the book the seemed to come upon everyone's list was ""The Alchemist"". I bought it at the beginning of the year and have only just got round to reading it. At first, when I got into it I thought this a load of waffle, it was just about a shepherd and his sheep, this is going to be boring. 

But then, as the pages went on, I found myself slowly going into a slight trance reading the book and into a meditative state. Rather the envisioning the shepherd from a 3rd person angle, I started seeing him asif i was him, looking through his eyes , and being him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was listening to Big Sean's podcast episode with Jay Shetty this morning and he said that "" When you pick a book up, you realize that the book was talking to you"". 

I've put this book off for so long but now, a time when I need it I was drawn to it. I'm having some of the best meditation ever while I'm reading this book. There are some wisdom and words in this book I've needed to hear for so long, and reading this book has put me in front of them. 

Meditation is an amazing thing. 

I am so grateful that I've had the power to be able to do this.

Thank you for reading this. &lt;3",The Alchemist + Meditation,1614896452
books,"I just finished Stephen King's 'IT'. It's the first book I've read by him. I found it tough going. It easily could have been HALF that length, surely?! So much waffling, diverting from the story, going into great detail about people or things that weren't relevant, or were repetitive.

Now, the characters themselves I thought were great. Maybe there wasn't a need to explore quite so many of them in quite so much detail ... but they were great.

My question is... was 'IT' simply the wrong choice of book as far as King novels go? In hindsight, I never see it mentioned or praised much, as opposed to 'The Stand' or '11/22/63'... both of which I've been very curious to read but now feel hesitant to try. Or is it that Stephen King's just probably not for me?",Stephen King - wrong book or not for everyone?,1614896140

They mention that they ""read"" the book, and there are a *lot* of upvoted comments telling OP that OP didn't ""read"" the book, they listened to it. Some of these commenters are more respectful than others, but all of them have this idiotic, elitist attitude about what it means to ""read"" a book. Why do you care? Someone is sharing the joy they experience while reading a book. Isn't that what this sub is all about? Get over yourselves.

There are also quite a few upvoted comments telling op that if WWZ is one of the best books they've read, then they need to read more books. There's no nuance here, these commenters are just being straight up rude.

Stop gatekeeping ""reading"" or whatever. Someone referring to listening to an audiobook as ""reading"" does not harm you in anyway.

EDIT: I am getting a lot of comments about about the definition of reading. The semantic point doesn't matter. As one commenter pointed out, an audio reader and a visual reader can hold a conversation about the same book and not realize they read in different formats. That's really all that matters. Also, when I see these comments, they usually include or imply some kind of value-judgment, so they aren't just comments on semantics.",What's with the gatekeeping surrounding audiobooks?,1614880882
