Believing that Haydée has for him only “the love and tenderness of a daughter”, Monte Cristo understands for the first time that she might love him for real when he sees her concern for him the night before the duel and carries her in his arms to her apartment (“the idea occurred to him for the first time, that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father”, ch.90). He regretfully concludes that he might have had a chance to be loved and therefore to be happy (“‘Alas’, murmured he, with intense suffering,‘I might, then, have been happy yet’”, ch.90). His happiness to see her, when he returns from the duel, is not less intense than hers, although not as evident. Kissing her forehead makes both their hearts beat strongly (“a kiss which made two hearts throbat once, the one violently, the other\[silently\]”, ch.92) and he dares to believe that he can love again. This belief is confirmed after his journey into the past of his imprisonment. Already having overcome the doubts risen in him with Edouard’s death, he overcomes another doubt concerning the woman he loves: while passing by the village of the Catalans, he looks away and murmurs Haydée’s name “in a voice of tenderness, amounting almost to love” (ch.113).

I n the last chapter (ch.117), although he knows that he loves her, the Count is still not sure if she loves him back (in his own words, “when we have suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in \[happiness\]”, ch.3). Therefore, with his mission accomplished, Monte Cristo is determined to punish himself for the pain he caused to the innocents and leave her side, not wanting to allow his destiny to overshadow hers. He sets her free, restoring her position, fortune and name, and asks her to “forget even my name, and be happy”. When she clearly confesses that she loves him, he accepts her redeeming love (“Let it be, then, as you wish\[...\] Love me then, Haidee!“).

  

Alexandre Dumas had many lovers with big age differences.

Anna Bauër, Antoine Bauër's wife, was born in 1823 and was 21 years younger than Dumas. 

Aimée Léocadie Doze was born in 1822 and was 20 years younger than Alexandre Dumas. 

Béatrix Person was born in 1828 and was 26 years younger than Dumas. 

Marie Guinde, known as Isabelle Constant was born in 1835 and was 33 years younger than Dumas. 

Fanny Gordosa was born in 1831 and was 29 years younger than Dumas 

Emilie (or Emélie) Cordier was born in 1840 and was 38 years younger than Dumas 

In 1860 Micaëlla-Clélie-Josepha-Élisabeth Cordier was born, daughter of Emélie Cordier at the age of 20 years old and Alexandre Dumas at the age of 58 years old.

Victor Perceval, pseudonym Marie-Laure Chaufour, also known as Aussi Marie de Fernand was born in 1835 and was 33 years younger than Dumas 

Emma Manoury-Lacour, Emma Adélaïde Gallard, Mme Anatole Mannoury-Lacour was born in 1823 and was 21 years younger than Dumas. 

Adah Isaacs Menken was born in 1832 and was 30 years older than Dumas. 

Olympe Audouard was born in 1830 and was 28 years younger than Dumas 

Nina de Callias (Anne-Marie Gaillard, known as Nina de Villard, comtesse Hector de Callias) was born in 1843 and was 41 years younger than Dumas

The ending is more consistent with Dumas' choices.

  

Life imitating art:

In the Soviet adaptation of the count of monte Cristo, Uznik zamka if (Узник замка Иф), the director of the film Georgi Yungvald-Khilkevich had a romance with actress Nadira Mirzayeva who played Haydee and if married her. He found happiness and peace with Nadira. She was 17 years old and the director was 52 when they started a romance.",About the end of the count of monte cristo,1595633949
books,"I was wondering what you all use for digital books for kids?  We have two that are elementary aged and are struggling to find a digital library that includes all the classic kid books.  I would like them to be independent from me and be able to browse and download their own choices, in addition to me being able to recommend for them (although that 2nd part is not a deal breaker).

We have tried the Amazon Freetime format, and don't like it (you can't really browse, can't recommend books for the kids, kinda hard to buy a book and get it approved and downloaded on their device, can't hook it up to library books, and it freezes up a lot).

We currently have an Epic! subscription and love the format, but there don't seem to be many of the ""classics"" that I recall from when I was a kid (does not have titles such as Black Stallion, My Side of the Mountain, Holes, Walk Two Moons, Indian in the Cupboard, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh, From the Mixed Up Files...., Shiloh, Rascal, etc.).  Seems good for non-fiction and ""fun fact"" type books.

Their school had a Tumblebooks subsription, but it seemed very limited just like Epic!.

Our local library has digital books, but I would either have to link them to my Amazon account (don't want to for a variety of reasons), or create Amazon accounts for each kid (seems a little absurd and not sure how that would work for them to be independent).

Digital books are a big supplement to our kids' hard copy books.  Anyone have any other options other than what I already described?  This is one of those situations where I keep thinking, ""surely I'm not the only one who has this need....""",E-Reading Platform for Kids,1595633629

books,"Personally my favorite has always been The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. The elements of surprise and the way that she structured the whole story was brilliant. When I first read the book, I was absolutely shocked by the ending. I had to go back and read it through again to look for clues and things that I missed during the first read. It helped to spark my interest in detective fiction. 

Granted, it was the first Christie novel that I read so there is some potential bias there. I have continued to read others since but this one still stands strong as my favorite.

books," Hey guys! Last week I created a post asking people for book series that started off well but descended into mediocrity. My own example was the Inheritance Cycle. I know it's only 4 entries, but Eragon and Eldest felt significantly less bloated compared to the sequels (Brisingr and Inheritance).

I got a lot of great responses to the post that brought up series I had read (Alex Rider), and series that I unfortunately wanted to read (The Dark Tower, The Wheel of Time).

Well, now's the time for the opposite question- a series that started off mediocre or bad but soon grew into something special!

This is definitely a lot harder b/c who sticks through with a book that doesn't catch their interest? For me, I'll say the Jack Reacher series. I don't think any of the entries were all that great, but at least the first few had fresh concepts and didn't rehash the action choreography, feature badly written sex scenes, and ruin Reacher's moral code.

books,"Hopefully the title makes sense, but to elaborate, I often face this problem where after I have watched a film or TV show based on a  book series (especially if these are well cast), if I later read the books, I often see and 'hear' the actor rather than come up with my own interpretation of the character. I love the imaginative aspect of reading and would love to be able to find ways to regain the ability to construct these characters based only on the description in the book and my reaction to these. 

I have purposely held off on watching the Lord of the Rings films for several years now in order to prepare for a re-read of the series and I am just now starting with the Hobbit now and still find myself seeing some of the actors from the series.

I was wondering if anyone has practical tips for how to sort of cleanse the palate and form your own image of characters. 

My initial ideas:

1. Find earlier illustrations of these characters, preferably from many different sources and/or time periods. This way you might break link to the actor that played this character. If you can't refresh your image entirely, maybe you can 'borrow' aspects from other depictions and then assemble your own image of them.
2. Concentrate on the descriptive passages in the book that refer to specific characters, perhaps even writing them all down together. This might help you find differences in how the author described a character and the actor that played them. Without intending to, I found out that this kind of worked for Gollum in the Hobbit.

Anyhow, I would be very interested to hear about your experiences of this phenomena (maybe it doesn't bother some of you?) and especially so if you have found a way around it.",How can you reimagine characters in a book after having seen the movie/TV show?,1595611807

I can't seem to accurately determine whether or not books are worth reading before I buy them. Reading is really the only hobby I spend money on, but it's still frustrating to drop $10-$13 consistently on books that I consider to be bad.

I have tried Goodreads ratings. I have tried reading good and bad reviews, while also attempting to avoid spoilers. I have read the free previews available on Amazon. Yet, without fail, I will determine that a book is something I'd like to read and end up DNF'ing it or feeling like I wasted my time finishing it. I'm glad that Amazon has an easy return policy for Kindle books, but it gets to the point where I feel bad returning several books back to back. 

There are authors that I enjoy, and I read whatever they write. I'm also the kind of person that loves discovering new authors, and reading new releases. This exacerbates the problem for me.

I'm one of those people who has to read my setworks before classes start so I can actually enjoy them and this book is a set work for my second semester.
I am absolutely blown away by how raw and passionate this book is.
And there is some beautiful imagery and lessons that can be taken from it. But more than that it really allows you to feel the struggle of the main character. 
Her emotions as she moved through her father dying, to finding out she was gay, to being called an abomination for it by her mother, to then living her life without guilt but with restriction, marrying a man even thought she didn't want to, and then leaving him to be with the lady she actually loved.
Wow! I didn't expect to be put through the wringer like that but it was a pleasure and a pain.
Also some added points for me:
It's set in Nigeria where (as of 2008 according to the book) being gay is a crime.
Its written by a black women
It features black women and men, of varying shades of skin colour. 
It has the most intriguing phrases and folktales
Although the book was heavy the ending was still good and felt completely right
Leaning about the different tribes in Nigeria was interesting.
The characters were all very real and human
The issues of religion were present but not over powering
And a million other things. I am very very happy to have read this. Highly recommend.

I'm about to finish my first read of ""Ulysses"" and I've absolutely loved the experience. While I haven't understood the entire thing, I've had a ton of fun getting lost in its structure and I've been enthralled by its humor and sheer imagination of how a novel can be constructed and composed to tell a story. I haven't read it with a companion guide of sorts because understanding every piece of it isn't important to me-- Ulysses has made me FEEL a lot of things and I'm happy enough with that.

I'm adding ""Infinite Jest"" to my list because I want to have a similar reaction to ""Ulysses,"" I want to be challenged and get wonderfully lost. For those of you that have read both, has your experience been similar to mine? Or is ""Infinite Jest"" on a whole different level that essentially requires a companion guide or supplemental material to get anything out of it?

He was asked if he was a Herald before and he said no. But then in the end it said he could heal and what not. Just throwing this out. So is he a Herald, a spren, an Unmade, or something else?

books,"I've been burned twice by both of these aspects of Goodreads, so I wanted to rant about it on the internet. 

Most recently, I saw a book pitched as the next ""Three Body Problem/Stranger Things/Arrival"". This was ""Axiom's End"" by someone named Lindisay Ellis. I was not familiar with this person, but a quick glance at Goodreads indicated that she was some sort of Youtube personality that talks about science fiction? Cool, fine, maybe she's got some insights. The book looked like it was reviewed upwards of 4 stars, so I was like, great, let's do this. 

This book was the most unoriginal, pathos-less entity that I've read in recent times. The protagonist is a college drop out who studied linguistics, and so obviously we can draw Arrival similarities, but a) the protagonist doesn't actually use those skills for first contact and b) the protagonist doesn't actually do anything pivotal or character-developing. She's basically a proxy through which the alien interacts with humanity, but it's only because he has a translator implanted within her head. Nothing that she achieves in this book is through any sort of merit on her part. Even her eventual kinship with the alien just feels like a shitty version of Stockholm syndrome. 

Then there's the purported Three Body Problem connection. Yes, the Great Filter is briefly mentioned, and the Dark Forest Theory is also briefly mentioned, but it is in no way utilized to say anything new. It's more like a hey, look, I can reference theories about alien contact! 

I still don't understand the relationship to Stranger Things, tbh. Is it because the aliens are kinda described like the Mindflayer looks in the show? Whatever. 

I have lots more complaints about the book itself, but my bigger problem is the fact that someone is out there describing this book (and others: see Max Gladstone's ""Empress of Forever"", a purported Guardians of the Galaxy romp, but caveat: it's not) as other pieces of media that have unique and meaningful contributions of culture. I am also disappointed in myself for falling for it more than once. I understand that people gotta market their books and drum up buzz, but arguably, I feel like authors ought to have some sort of integrity to not mislead their readers. 

When I went to review the book on Goodreads, I realized that most of the ratings were actually skewed by people who were fans of Lindsay Ellis that were basically saying FIVE STARS I'M EXCITED TO READ THIS. People shouldn't be allowed to rate books they haven't actually read!!!

books,"Okay so it has always been in my reading list but I never could really start it off. 
And now since I finished it yesterday, the detailings of the characters, those incidents, the love and seperation, are not getting out of mind.
It's an absolute masterpiece and told in such a musical way. It evokes more of a poem sensations than that of a fiction.

There's a story and from the beginning itself, Roy had clearly indicated how it would end but what really is special about the book is the journey of the characters. Even after having the knowledge of the storyline still there was not a single moment of complacency while I read it.
TBH I didn't even want to finish at all. It could have continued like forever and I wouldn't have gotten bored of it.

books,"I used to be a serious reader when I was in middle school, and sort of lost touch with that side of me in high school and college. I only got back into it after I read Brida, and remembered what it was like to see yourself in a character in words. I haven't gotten back to reading as much as I used to, but I read 1984 for the second time a months ago and I read the whole thing in two days, working full time. I can't believe how much I had missed reading the book as an adult vs when I was a teenager. I even watched the film after that, and I liked my imaginations from the book more! 

After that I read Kafka on the Shore, Frankenstein, Bell Jar, Alice's adventures in wonderland, Ready player one and none of them grabbed my attention quite as well as The five people you meet in heaven. I read the entire book in maybe 4-5 hours. I couldn't put it down. I put my phone on silent and disconnected from the internet just to not get notifications! I just wanted to know what it all meant. 

The lesson that stayed with me from this book was that heaven, or whatever you want to call it (hey, an atheist here - I don't believe in this either, but it's nice to think about) is some place you know. Some place you want. Something just for you. Some place you're happy. Maybe even a place on earth, right now. 

Seriously, wow. It was cheesy at times, and I've seen too many cheesy movies because I kept thinking of the big important dialogue being said as ""last words"" before something else or big happens... and I very much thought it was going to end a certain way and that I would be disappointed because it was so predictable ... and it completely surprised me.","I just finished reading The Five People You Meet In Heaven in a few hours and I don't know how to feel, so I'm just gonna sip on some juice and contemplate my entire life... the first book I couldn't put down since 1984.

When reading a book i try and understand HOW to read it, what to look for, to best appreciate it. What to look for so i am meeting the author halfway and able to pick up what they are putting down.

I dont know anyone irl who has read this book, so i cant discuss - reviews all praise it but there's nothing in the praise that really lets me get a foot in the door.

I dont like to criticize, but at this time it just all feels very flat. Not very descriptive of people or places. Not a lot of emotional insight. I appreciate the way the heat is described, but that's about all that stands out.

Any thoughts? I would love to know what you enjoy about it so maybe i can to. I would hate to finish reading this and come away feeling nothing.
