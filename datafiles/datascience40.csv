datascience,"This has happened more than once to me: I write my code, it works as intended per goals set by manager, I explain what I did to manager best I can, they don't understand it, and then says what we should do... which literally happens to be what I just did and showcased. I reiterate that that is what I had just accomplished, and then they understand. If they don't understand then, they understand later when it comes to production and they end up reverting back to something I wrote weeks prior. 

I don't think this my manager's fault. I think it is my fault. I generally have a hard time explaining things I do or what's going on in my head, especially if it is very complicated and there are parts that would take me a while to explain without walking through the math for them or writing them up first. Communication is so key in this field, but it is currently my shortcoming. It wasn't always the case, it just started happening when I shifted my field from something else to this field.

datascience,"Hi, amateur data scientist here, and I've been tasked with building an automated categorization tool for supplier lists. In essence, it needs to take a vendor name, and output what category it falls into. Categories include, but are not limited too: Transportation, Legal, IT, Construction, Staffing, Manufacturing, or Maintenance &amp; Installation.

So far, I've considered two strategies.

* *Option A*
Using a google search API to scrape the top ten search results for that vendor, build or utilize an existing NLP algorithm to match the Google output with a category from a pre-built table of categories. 

* *Option B*
Build a table of supplier names and their associated categories using previous data, and then fuzzy match new supplier data as best I can with the pre-built table. This one is tricky as ""Delta Air Inc,"" ""D Airlines,"" ""Delta"" would all need to be matched to the same supplier, but not ""D Air""--that's an air conditioning company. Additionally, it would be added too as needed---if the supplier isn't present, either manually input their data or utilize something like *Option A*. 

Looking over the two options, I see now that they may be one and the same, but two different levels in the hierarchy of the tool. 

Either way, I wanted to see what the smart users of this subreddit would suggest. How would you tackle it? Any algorithms that could simplify things? Is there a tool out there you know about that accomplishes this very goal?","Big-Picture Help for Project, Categorizing Supplier Names",1594744660

tldr: My team's codebase is a mess of unorganized and poorly documented jupyter notebooks/.py files and I am trying to figure out the best method/way of managing all of it in a more standardized way.

As the title states, how do you all manage your company/team's codebase/tools? I recently got hired in a healthcare company as a statistical modeling analyst and to say the least - their unorganized as hell when it comes to their code. In the past, the position I have was handled by one person and basically just held all their code/juptyer notebooks in their personal directory; I am talking about \~2.5 years worth of ad hoc analysis, analytic tools (finished and unfinished), jupyter notebooks that outline several major processes. There are also some major production tools he made that are stored in his folder without any real meaningful way of doing some version control.

Then about 8 months ago, they hired my co-worker (lets call him Bob) who didn't have any coding background and learned by just re-using the first guy's work. He accessed/still accesses it through the first guy's folder, but copied it over to his own personal folder and added a bunch of edits. Well, the first guy leaves to Google and he leaves this mess without much documentation (I am talking even without much comments within the notebooks, let alone a README file).

Fast-forward to a month ago, I come in and am shadowing Bob and he is jumping back and forth across multiple (read: almost a dozen) different folders at a time trying to find the right jupyter notebook to use, has at least 5 untitled jupyter notebooks opened at once doing several things (sometimes working on the same project across multiple notebooks), and overall just a very messy and poorly documented workflow. Outputs get put in not a standardized fashion, everything just seems like a mess. He even confuses himself sometimes on which notebook is working on what.

I myself am starting to build tools/automate parts of the job, but I don't want to fall in the same habit of just storing it all on my personal directory and have files (.py) floating around everywhere. Luckily this position gives me a lot of freedom to spend time improving on this aspect of the job. So to return back to the original reason for the post - what is the best way to go about this? Should I try pushing for a github for our team in order to organize everything? Or is there a better alternative? My background is astrophysics so I don't have much experience doing version control or managing codebases, but since I'm planning on being in the position for a while, I dont want to have a bajillion notebooks open at once.",How do you manage your company's codebase?,1594744349

datascience,"I’m working on a list of walk-throughs for a list of statistical methods used for digital marketing.

The steps for each walk-through would be:

1. what we're trying to achieve or optimise towards,
2. the statistical method to apply,
3. the data needed and the structure it needs to be in,
4. the R scripts and libraries to use while noting which variables to replace and parameters to adjust,
5. interpretation of the results.

This wouldn’t be a replacement for an analyst’s subject matter expertise, creativity, business acumen, communication skills or common sense. And it wouldn’t cover data cleaning and formatting or communication (there are already loads of tutorials in these areas).

The idea is that based on what the analyst would want to do, they’d need to source the relevant data, explore it, clean/format it and structure it accordingly before applying the applicable R scripts against it and interpreting and communicating the results.

The reason I’m saying R instead of Python is because I think R has an easier way to implement the statistical methods required to get the results and is more conducive to the end of goal of digital analysts and marketeers. Plus I found it a lot easier to setup and use than Python!

As data analysts we already spend a lot of time on measurement tool configuration, data collection, data cleaning and basic reporting &amp; dashboard building that we barely get time to do deep analysis and curation of the story from the data.

Anyway, the below list is what I have so far:

1. **AB testing &amp; experiments (same period):** using t-test, chi-square, etc. Used to compare the conversion rate or CTR or other key ratio between ad(s), campaign(s) and/or audience(s). This is usually done during the same period to exclude the effects of seasonality. 
2. **AB testing &amp; experiments (different periods):**  Used for identifying if a campaign or some other change has resulted in an increase in conversions or other target results. This is specifically for comparing one period against another period. An example would be to estimate how much of an increase in site visits after running a TV campaign was due to the TV campaign. This is usually asked as “what is the incremental increase in metric X due to event Y”.  The statistical method used is causal inference using Bayesian structural time-series models. 
3. **Algorithmic digital attribution:** using Markov Chain/Shapely Values against conversion path data from GA MCF or DCM Attribution. Would be great to be able to use Facebook Advanced Attribution data as well but unfortunately they don’t provide conversion paths.
4. **Forecasting of sales/visits/any metric on a trend line:**  Used to forecast a metric (such as sales/visits/any metric) on a daily, weekly or any periodic trend line. Using Facebook’s Prophet library and ARIMA. Using Monte Carlo forecasting to take into account multiple variables.
5. **Media mix modelling:** using regression and taking into account seasonality and ad stock. Using FB Prophet and others.
6. **Product recommendations:** using collaborative filtering. This can be used to show products in the footer of cart pages for upsell or for email marketing.
7. **Lead scoring:** using logistic regression or others. Used to prioritise which customers to contact as they would have the features most associated with likely customers.
8. **Customer segmentation analysis:** using RFM scoring. Used to send different messages to different segments via email or social advertising.

It's a data analysis+consulting job, but it's really low tech data analysis - I look at survey data, monthly sales data and some other metrics, do some basic analysis in Excel (significant test, some pivot table etc.) and provide insights report. I left the company as a mid-level manager with a small team and client account responsibilities. I have no prior CS/Programming experience.

The plan is to do it online+full-time.

Now ideally I'd like go with those big name institutions with reputation. But I found it challenging for a few reasons (listed below). My ultimate questions are **how different are these programs from institution to institution? Is the difference really so big that worth all the troubles/$? If I just finish a ""mediocre"" program and land a DS job, can the difference be made up by work experience later/self learning on the side?** By the way I understand this is an industry that requires perpetual learning and I have no problem of doing that.  

1) Fall admission (even some spring cohorts) deadlines are passed. My favorite, the OMSCS at Georgia Tech, does have a spring class but the deadline was July 1 - so unfortunately that's also in the past. I will have to wait for another year to get into a lot of those programs. No spring chicken anymore I want to start relatively quickly.

2) Bar is pretty high for those programs. Some of them require GRE/GMAT that I don't have. My bachelor was acquired outside of US, so some programs need a TOEFL score. My GPA is only 2.8 - below the minimum of 3.0 of majority programs. So it will take me some effort to make up the gap in GPA and get a good score in those exams. Is it worths it?

3) I have no previous programming experience. I do plan to learn from bootcamps before the program starts. But if I start applying now, I don't have any on my resume. 

4) Cost seems to be really high for those reputable universities.

We pull a subset of the columns in the dataset, and perform some basic data manipulations, a task that in any other org I worked in would be accomplished by running a sql query up against a database. But they act as if I'm asking for some cutting edge technology when I ask if we can connect directly to the database with an odbc or jdbc driver. This is a large company with 50k+ employees you've probably heard of if you live in the US, not a small startup.

A  little backstory on myself; I have been living in the United States for  the past 20 years and have received a BS in Computer Science in 2018.  During this time I was an extremely troubled/unfocused student who was  fighting severe depression and didn't perform very well. This led me to  be on academic probation two times, but I managed to get myself  reinstated right away. Another consequence of my choices meant that I  was not able to get even a single internship throughout my whole  undergraduate career. To add to the stress I was an F1 student due to my  parents receiving their green card after I turned 21. With the OPT  (Optional Practical Training) around the horizon, I got scared and  decided to enter into a master's program in Data Science. This bought me  an extra 1.5 years.

I managed to  turn my life around at this point and with the fresh start, and a  tremendous patience advisor, I managed to achieve a 4.0 and will be  graduating with a 4.0 in August. I know GPA might not mean too much  during someone's graduate career, but to me, it is a good sign of my  personal progress.  With my advisor's help, I was able to join get a GRA  position doing research in instance segmentation, using Mask R-CNN, and  time-series wind power forecasting using ARIMA and LSTM with economic  dispatching. The instance segmentation project got accepted/published at  the BigData 2019 conference for a poster presentation and I was able to  get a trip funded by my school which was truly a great taste at  success. I have one more paper already accepted and waiting to be  published in the ""Journal of Building Engineering"", along with one more  paper on the same subject being prepared for an IEEE submission. I  already have work on the forecasting paper and once all the results are  in we will be looking to publish that one as well. I am a co-author on  all of these papers.

I am not back  in the same situation I was in a year and a half ago. I am graduating  and this time my OPT application has already been submitted and the  start date is in September. This leaves me 90 days to find a job before I  face deportation. I am trying to prepare for interviews/jobs and am  struggling to find a starting point.

To add to this the Data  Science program at my school is extremely new and I will be the first  graduate from the program, so I'm not able to find much success talking  to my peers. One flaw I noticed in myself is that my statistical  background is not as strong as I would like. After doing some research I  have found two books I am currently reading through to refamiliarize  myself with the basics of statistics. These books are ""Think Stats"" and  ""Think Bayes"". I would love your suggestions/opinions on these books or  any others that would be a good fit for me. To add to this I have also  registered in some edX courses on statistics and I am working through  them in conjunction. I am trying to find positions where I am using  machine learning and doing analytics. Apart from just reviewing the  basic statistics, I mentioned above, what else should I be focusing on  to better prepare myself? The skillset I am trying to sell myself on is  that I am proficient in Python, Java, the concepts of OOP, and software  development.

I have extensive knowledge  of the UNIX system but can work just as easily on all 3 OS's. Lastly, I  am versed in reading/writing documentation.

I'm looking for companies that offer data science roles (mostly in the financial sector just because that is where most of my experience is in and I am comfortable dealing with finance-based data -- even though I've applied to firms from other industries).

The roles I've applied to include junior data scientist, entry-level data scientist, data analyst, junior data analyst, quantitative analyst, internships pertaining to the aformentioned roles, and other similar roles. I applied to all sorts of companies (start-ups, small-medium size companies, big firms, and even public sector). In the beginning (before COVID-19 pandemic), I've interviewed a couple of times. But then the pandemic came and these companies went on hiring freezes.

I've applied nearly 2,000 times and only either got ignored or automated rejection emails. I used job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, Glassdoor, Google, Upwork, ZipRecruiter, USAJobs, and Angel List. I've also directly applied on company websites. I've even directly messaged company recruiters and pertinent managers on LinkedIn if that company had a job post.

During this pandemic I've been learning new technical skills, built a COVID-19 dashboard and working on a machine learning trading algorithm (see details in resume on bottom of post).

I'm not sure what I am doing wrong. I've posted my resume (anonymized) on the bottom of this post. I even optimized my resume through a paid service on [resumeworded.com](https://resumeworded.com/) to make it more ATS friendly. (and no this is not an advertisement for this service haha)

I am looking to do a linear modeling project to add for my portfolio and settled on this [dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips-2020/rmc8-eqv4), which has a record of all rideshare trips in the City of Chicago for the year of 2020. The data has over 23 million rows and I can't download it (server stops after like 10gb is downloaded, not that it is a good idea to even try). 

Is there a way I can filter it down somehow? I was trying to create a model to predict fares based off certain features. Which columns/features do you guys think are interesting or important. Another option would be to somehow limit the amount of records using API (I have a Socrata dev account) and in the past used pagination to control how many records I was interested in.

For those of you who manage data science managers/people leaders, do you (or members of your interview panels) have different expectations of their technical aptitude? Or are your expectations the same as ICs who apply for \[senior/principal\] data science roles?

Why I'm asking this question: I'm a people manager myself at a mid-sized company in the Bay Area, 4+ years of leadership experience (in industry for 15), and I am simply not as ""in the weeds"" as my team members are... nor is there an expectation by my leadership teams that I code or query every day. However, I have applied to other manager positions, and my technical interviews have been VERY technical: I've had a total of 10-15 technical-round interviews in the last 6-8 months. It's clear that I pass the leadership scrutiny test, but I continue to miss expectations on the technical front. I understand that every team's needs are different... but are companies really expecting senior managers and/or directors to be able to perform technically at the same level as ICs? Or is the truth of the matter that I--and others in my situation--simply have to review like crazy, even at this level?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi All, I'm 28 years old and currently working as a senior data/pricing analyst (primarily utilize SQL and Excel, but I use R whenever I can and is reasonable) at a publicly traded company (make roughly $77k/year in an urban area). I taught myself SQL and R through DataCamp over the past 18 months and my current employer probably won't reimburse or assist with grad school financing.

I've recently began researching certain online programs for Masters in Data Science (or data analytics, depending on the program's curriculum) to help further my skills and advance my career. I enjoy statistics (I write analytics-based articles for fantasy football) and would be interested in doing ML or more advanced modeling and analyses in the future. I'd prefer to continue working to help pay for bills but want to do what's best for my career and future earnings. As such, I wanted to gain some perspective on a few things.

1. Are there major differences between on-campus vs. online programs (e.g., UVA has an [online DS program](https://onlinedatasciencemasters.virginia.edu/program/overview/) and [residential](https://datascience.virginia.edu/degrees/msds-degree))? In this case, the advisor said both programs show the same exact degree and maintain the same professors with online lectures every week. Harvard also has an online program through its Extended Studies school for \~$36k, which I've seen retains a certain stigma.
2. Would a professional certificate (e.g., [Dartmouth's Professional Certificate in Applied Data Science](https://emeritus.engineering.dartmouth.edu/data-science/index.php), which is immediately ""on sale"" for $6500 due to COVID) be more effective and helpful? Or are they money grabbers or unnecessary? In Dartmouth's case, they only have an on-campus Masters program, and I may be given some advantages by completing the certificate, but wouldn't be a guarantee or lead directly into coursework.
3. What are some key things to consider when weighing one program against the next? For example, online programs like UVA and Northwestern's don't require GRE submissions, so would this be red flag?
4. Are Masters programs even worth it or MOOCs and individual projects/teaching the way to go?
