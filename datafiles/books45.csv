Like a kid with a new bicycle I can't get off the damn thing, I started Post Office last night and I'm already one third of the way through and I'm enjoying these books like I've never enjoyed a book before. I just wanted to share a small passage from the book that really got me and wanted to suggest the Chinaski series to anyone who hasn't given them a read. 
.
""I climbed the stairway (there was no elevator)
and put the key in. The door swung open. Somebody had changed
all the furniture around, put in a new rug. No, the furniture
was new too.
There was a woman on the couch. She looked all right. Young.
Good legs. A blonde.
""Hello,"" I said, ""care for a beer?""
""Hi!"" she said. ""All right, I'll have one.""
""I like the way this place is fixed up,"" I told her.
""I did it myself.""
""But why?""
""I just felt like it,"" she said.
We each drank at the beer.
""You're all right,"" I said. I put my beercan down and gave
her a kiss. I put my hand on one of her knees. It was a nice knee.
Then I had another swallow of beer.
""Yes,"" I said, ""I really like the way this place looks. It's really
going to lift my spirits.""
""That's nice. My husband likes it too.""
""Now why would your husband ... What ? Your husband ?
Look, what's this apartment number?""
""309.""
""309? Great Christ! I'm on the wrong floor! I live in 409. My
key opened your door.""
""Sit down, sweety,"" she said.
""No, no...""
I picked up the 4 remaining beers.
""Why rush right off?"" she asked.
""Some men are crazy,"" I said, moving toward the door.
""What do wou mean?""
""I mean, some men are in love with their wives.""
She laughed. ""Don't forget where I'm at.""
I closed the door and walked up one more flight. Then I opened
my door. There was nobody in there. The furniture was old and
ripped, the rug almost colorless. Empty beercans on the floor. I
was in the right place.
I took off my clothes, climbed into bed alone and cracked
another beer.""",Post Office,1597017581

books,"So I just finished the audiobook of Circe after seeing the hypetrain. And it was alright like a 6 out of ten there was nothing wrong with it but nothing wonderful and great. I mean it the opening bits where great the parts with Prometheus and the being at her father's hall interesting. But a soon as she hit that island boy did this book decide to just go cliff diving. 

And her is my issues Circe is not a good female lead or a feminine icon as I have seen in some reviews(clearly this is my opinion all this is my opinion). So Circe gets her empower on the island great she gets in an friends with benefits relationship with Hermas great. 

Her sister is like hey come her I need your help giving birth to my bull headed son( ha puns) so goes. Cool we learn that her sister banged a bull because she had to stay relevant in this world of gods that she has had to survive and degrade herself in order to maintain her status and have protection from other gods. Wow what a shift this is going to have on Circe to see her sister in this new light as they both have suffered. Nope her sister was mean and while maybe they could have been friends or grown close Circe hates 90% of the female population (I'll get there) so she  rejects her sister and goes home. 

She is back and a minor goddess has shown up at her place like hey my dad sent me here for a bit as punishment for giving my virginity to a moral. How does Circe respond to this seeing another being punish for using her body as she wishes? Does she try and talk to her? Does she feel sympathy for her? Nope this is a bother to her how dare people use Circe as a punishment screw this nobody who was punished what about Circe. Also just kinda doesn't realize how privilege she is being used as a punishment for being to serve her is because she is still seen as a being of importance. Even though she is like woe is me if she wasn't the daughter of one of the most powerful gods she be dead. 

Her niece shows up one day with Jason is like hey forgive us for our sins she does, they talk about how Jason is gonna Jason. And her niece leaves. Then she is reunioned with the brother she helped raised and who  loved her. Now is the same as the myth and is a creepy evil person. Why is he like this idk myths say he is so instead of the book showing how the system can corrupt men slowly over time, having him have more than 2 dimensions, or doing the same thing with  Prometheus where he say what he would be and thus had no choice but to be that thing and in a way is just a slave to another system same as her. Nope he is mean because most gods are mean. 

Now the worse part of the book for me the rape and pig parts. Okay I think I understand what she were trying to go for that no matter who you are no matter how much you prepare and plan the worse thing in the world can happen to you. It's a powerful message that talks about the worse thing in this world. I just don't think it was handle well having it be by a random human was flawed to me because it removes the strength of Circe in an early part of the book Circe has some supernatural powers in terms of physical ability she can walk like a God which is implied to be superfast. But the bigger issue is having it be this random no name person she immediately punishes takes away from the trauma because the sad fact is most women are never able to get that vengeance. I think it needed to be a god I was thinking Hermas because he has made it clear how little the idea bothers him and he was told no, but i think it would make his later actions be more evil and just cruel so I think any random god would do. Now for the pig thing it makes the rape scene feel like it was only there for character development as it is what makes her the witch who turns men into pigs. It doesn't effect her future relationship or sexual encounters. While important as it is if you look at it through a book writing  prospective it was needed to get her to that place to be that person but keep her sympathic. Also while th book I think should have made the connections about how she is now acting more like her sister to show how having that happen to both of them has had such an affect that it would make her sister more sympathic it doesn't make tha connection and I think that is a shame. 

Okay Odysseus is perfect love how they did his ptsd and handle him. Not a fan of the whole i am get pregnant on purpose without telling him that was really crappy and might have had an impact on the story. But it happened we have to have the myths happen the way they normally do. 

Athena got done dirty just seeming 2 dimensional with save Odysseus and no other traits but whatever. 

Her raising her son was fine it was standard though both the birthing scene were well done. 

Trigon bit was great really interesting character. Circe was great there

Her leaving the island and becoming mortal for a man was bad her basically going daddy your wrong and I am leaving the corrput system was okay i guess. Her choicing to become mortal instead of making him a god is dumb but it feels kinda like the titanic door thing were its not the point. 


Last little rant: I don't see how Circe is empowering because its basically I am not like other girls. Nearly every other women in this book is view as bad from her sister to the nymphs, to Athena. Circe doesn't try to befriend any of them even her sister she is like no we can be alike even though we both had to survive a place that views us a objects, and we later become really similar. Yes Ik it say Circe only piged  those who had a look in their eyes as if they were looking for the man of the house, but i would like to point out that she doesn't know for sure and has no way of confirming and is just going on a perceived idea that they would do something. And I get it but the fact stands. I understand feminism is about owning ones sexuaility but other lart is empowering and unity women which this doesn't do.

Where I feel a little lost though is how the story of Pontius Pilate fits into the narrative. Is there any significance to him besides his pride having him deny Jesus being parallel to the prideful way characters like the poet declare their atheism? Pontius is not the only person in the bible to not follow god so I wonder if there is any significance to choosing him.

books,"I picked up the book after a lot of my fellow readers suggested it. But in most of their recommendations, one thing rose up as common, and that was that the book is an emotional ride. After reading it myself, I'm inclined to agree. But prior to reading it, and even my among my other friends who are wary of picking it up, the common perception of the book doesn't seem to be ""an emotional ride"". Rather it's more along the lines that the book may be overly emotional, ""a tearjerker"". But here, I disagree. I do not think that the book was written with the objective of evoking empathetic tears. Rather, it related events, from an almost neutral standpoint. Almost. But that is besides the point. I have read books that have left me feeling genuinely sad, or disturbed, or full of tears and emotions. I do tend to avoid picking up such books during busy periods of my life. Hence the initial apprehension towards The Book Thief. But after reading it, I found it to be nothing of the sort. I kept waiting and waiting for that immense jerk that would send tears streaming down my face. It never came. Instead, I went through a gentle and beautiful ride of emotions. It was glorious. And at the end it was soft and warm. I loved the book. And every minute I spent reading it was worth it, tears or not. So then, why has the perception of the book become that of a tearjerker? And why does that perception keep certain readers away? 

If nothing else, the book is extremely thought provoking. Especially in this pandemic. Who would be the ones worst affected? The politics in the book is not to be belittled either. It truly describes how ""Heils"" aren't born overnight. 

But more than anything, it describes the beauty, power and meaning of words. Even a self written story of an unknown book thief, a story that met an untimely demise at the hands of death, on top of a garbage pile, even those dead words, had power. And purpose. And meaning. And an afterlife. And that they comforted, if no one else, then death itself. And eventually, their own writer. Although I must say, it left me curious. About the rest of the book thief's life. How did she end up in Sydney? And who did she marry? Well, while I'm curious, I'm also satisfied. Those maybe stories for another day. They weren't part of Himmel Street or of the Book Thief.

books,"Before I get into the reasons, I just need to say DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE COVER. I bought it after reading a review and I don't think I would've picked it up in any normal circumstance because the cover just does not do it justice.

If you liked Six of Crows or any book that involves groups of delinquents attempting to overthrow a hierarchy in a world with magic and blood bonding then this is a book for you. Lets get into the reasons.  


1. **Character development**. The book is written from alternating views between the 5 main characters. Since the very beginning of the book, the author creates very distinctive and lovable characters (even if some are morally grey). They really came to life in my imagination and isn't character development the main aspect anyone wants from a story?
2. **Diversity.** There are 3 POC main characters. There is great bisexual, asexual and gay representation and also a plus size character. The book also portrays anxiety in a very realistic way. (The character who has anxiety was actually the bravest character in my opinion).
3. **Magic.** Some people have abilities to see prophecies, read fortunes and see in to the very near future, remove or give back people's memories. Others can read thoughts and see people's past. There is also blood bonding which allows a person to control a particular element like silver/gold.
4. **Exciting plot.** Even though I did see the plot twist coming, I still found the book thoroughly exciting . The main characters are sentenced to death in the first few pages so the action is present right from the get-go! 
5. **Slow-building romance.** I don't want to spoil anything so I won't go into detail but hell is it super cute!!

The writing style is interesting, especially the battle scenes, and the characters are compelling. However, I can't get it out of my head that the overarching story (so far at least) is identical to *A Song of Ice and Fire*. 

There is a group called the Shanka, a non-human species that attacks and kills any people they come in contact with. They live in the far north and people in the South don't even believe they exist. Their numbers have been growing in recent years. Simultaneously, in the North, the various warring tribes and factions have for the first time been united under one king. This northern king plans on attacking the Union (which is in the South). The Union meanwhile is corrupt and full of scheming lords and can't seem to agree on anything or get anything done. They aren't taking the threat to the North seriously and are instead busy with internal squabbles.

Is this not virtually identical to the Whitewalkers, Wildlings and Mance Raider, 7 Kingdoms, and all that. I know that all authors borrow from others to some degree but this strikes me as a bit too on the nose, especially considering that *The Blade Itself* was published in 2006 (1 year after *A Feast for Crows*).

I started it a few months ago at the beginning of quarantine in my renewed quest to begin reading again. I left it alone in favor of finding other books to read, depending on my mood. Yesterday my husband and I made a quick day trip to Grand Isle. Being from that area of Louisiana, I’ve grown up going to the island every summer, and it felt right to pick the book up again while there. I finally finished it this morning and am left with a sense of both freedom and weight.

It’s the eternal choice between what is wanted and what is expected. The right choice. The easy choice. The hard, but worth it choice. What will they say? How will I cope? Am I enough? We never know the outcomes until after the decision is made. Edna chose neither, instead ending it on her own terms. But does that make her selfish or selfless? Or was the pain too much to bear that it didn’t matter? 

It’s been awhile since a book has had such an impact on me, and it threw me quite off guard this morning with such a slow, but quick build of emotion to the end, which shook me to the core due to the overwhelming sense familiarity I fee with Edna and the novel as a whole. 

The one thing that irks me however is the silly e-reader version I purchased goes straight into her short stories right after the end of the novel. I read an entire short story thinking it was a continuation of the novel before I realized it wasn’t. It really added to the emotional jumble, and what otherwise would have been a wonderful ending for a moment of reflection.

What I don't understand is what Quilty added to the story of Lolita. In many ways, Humbert and Quilty are similar characters, both are articulate pedophiles from Europe, but Quilty seems like an even darker version of Humbert. Humbert tries to portray his relationship with Dolores as romantic where as Quilty just seems like a child pornographer who uses and discards Dolores. I was wondering if this is part of the unreliable narrator aspect. Humbert sees himself as a romantic, but he's far closer to Quilty than he's willing to admit?

Something I've been thinking a lot about lately is the state of novels like these in today's literary and social landscape. Put more simply: Can sprawling, complex novels be published today? In our era of clickbait news headlines, TikTok, social media, etc. - is there even an appetite for dense, immersive literature? Works like IJ and GR and Underworld sought to comment on a specific point (or points) in our history. Is there even a need for this anymore when you can follow the culture minute-by-minute on Twitter?","Are we beyond the days of long, complex novels?",1596994206

\*Forgive me if this is a bit lengthy, I don't usually do reviews unless I really like the read\*

A couple days now since I finished listening to the book and forgotten what I wanted to say how I felt about it, so here's my attempt to share my thoughts.

This is my first in many respects. My first book by Megan Whalen Turner. My first in the Queen's Thief series, and the first audiobook I've listened from start to finish. I enjoyed this and took any opportunity I had to give it a listen. (At work on lunch breaks, doing some shopping, cycling around my local area, laying in bed before going to sleep).

How did I feel about the book?

Personally, I felt the book played out more like a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, ""Here's your quest, find this item and bring it back to me for your reward"" etc. Large parts of the book were spent with the group of characters travelling to their destination while along the way establishing the worlds history, society, geography, the characters own backgrounds, and reason for being there all through stories of their own.

The author did a good job at building a vast open world with multiple countries and to whom they share their borders including the state of affairs between them.

For the audiobook edition I thought that the narrator really brought the story to life. Steve West gave the book that more of an appeal with his voice by adding emotion and intensity to character exchanges, when describing the scenes that lay before the characters very eyes helped with world building and immersion, giving each character a voice of their own instead of reusing the same tone over and over again for every person that was introduced along the way.

I got lost at times needing to go back and listen again to what had been said but thats just me as I'd be doing something else at the same time meaning my attention would shift slightly.

Overall I thought The Thief was an enjoyable read and had me pondering what was going to happen next when I had to stop listening.","[Finished Reading] The Thief, by Megan Whalen Turner (audiobook edition, narrated by Steve West)",1596993682

books,"I am not a very avid reader but made a goal to read more books this year than the previous one (and with the previous years total being 0, it has not be that hard of a feat). Anyways, my power went out the other day for a few hours so I decided to pick up that book that’s been sitting on my nightstand collecting dust for the past 5 years. NYPD RED, a James Patterson book. Being a thriller with most chapters being 1-4 pages long every time I completed a chapter I had this instant urge to continue further and further into the book. Needless to say it only took me around 2 days to read which is really fast under my standards.

With the last 3 books I read being the lord of the rings trilogy, the fast pace of this book felt so refreshing. Not to undermine LOTR in any way as those books are amazing and will always be some of my all time favorites, the more complex dialect and the sophistication of middle earth made it so that each book to me around a month to fully complete. 

I guess my point is that books with small chapters but lots of chapters have reignited my thirst to read within the past week, when I had Previously started but got no where with 3 or 4 different books within the past month. 

Also, I recognize a lot of books are structured this way, such as Moby Dick (on my reading list) but NYPD RED was the first that really stood out to me. Not to mention that the structuring if the chapters really added to the overall storyline of the book. Just picked up NYPD RED 2 this morning and am really looking forward to exploring the rest of the series.

books,"I lost my dad three months ago. He battled an illness for two months and I was at the hospital taking care of him. It was a traumatic experience for everyone in the family because Covid-19 made the hospital short-staffed and the treatment he received was far from ideal. The pain of seeing him pass away in agony is something that haunts me every day. After everything was over, I turned to books and media. I thought, well, last year I was too busy to read books, so I might as well use the free time to catch up with reading. 

A long introduction, I know. 

I've never believed that reading itself is comforting; for me it is the book that does the trick. Reading depressing books only made me feel worse and left me exhausted. Then, I found All Systems Red (Murderbot Book 1) on discount. I read it and absolutely loved it. I wanted to read the rest but I hesitated because of the somewhat expensive price (and I'm talking about e-books). In the end, I began to feel I was going to be a bit overwhelmed by my angst, so I just bought all the four remaining books and read them back to back over a period of two days. It was the best decision I'd made in a long time.

What do I love about the Murderbot Diaries? They're funny--Murderbot is funny. The future it is located in isn't ideal, but at least people can marry whoever they want regardless of gender and identify as non-binary with no one complaining. It does help that the stories are narrated from the point of view of an intelligent construct that doesn't give a crap about human relationships or sexuality. I enjoy his adventures. The villains aren't memorable (perhaps, they aren't meant to be); it doesn't matter because the books have the right amount of action and suspense and camaraderie. Reading them is a stress-free experience that brought me out of a funk and got me reading more and feeling lighter than I have in ages. 

The book has been discussed and referenced here before. I'm fairly new to Reddit and this community, but I noticed it being mentioned in some threads.

books,[removed],Recommendations,1596987277
books," Hello! I’ve lurked around this sub long enough and finally have something of note to post. 

A few months ago while lurking on this sub I came across a post where various science fiction books were recommended, chief among them were the Old Man’s War series, Peter Hamilton’s Judas Unchained, Dune, and Ian M Banks culture series. Needless to say being a massive fan of sci fi I bought all of them. I’ve been on the fence on buying them for a while but reading your descriptions and explanations for the books really made the decision for me. 

So a little background (you can skip this as its not in context of the book but more of who I am):

I am from Malaysia a country which unfortunately doesn’t really have that much of a science fiction community or circle for me to share my thoughts and have discussions with. In fact unfortunately among my closest friends only I read books and if any of the others do their area of interest is definitely not sci fi. As some of you may know, that makes the mind a little lonely because sometimes all you want to do is discuss the various ways humanity can move along the Kardashev scale. Anyway moving on, I’m a child of the sci fi era, grew up watching Star Trek (TNG), Stargate, and Star Wars, not to mention all the other amazing shows such as Battlestar Galactica and etc. More than anything since I was a kid I wanted to be in a starship, I wanted to be a part of a generation that took mankind to the stars. These books recommendations from these sub has been perfect to fill the void left by not having any decent sci fi series on TV/streaming.

Now, onward with the series: Old Man’s War:

Omg this book series is amazing. I am close to finishing the 3rd book in the series “The Last Colony” and I have got so much to talk about that I couldn’t wait till it was done to post this. 

Scalzi is an amazing author. Prior to this series I finished the Last Emperox series to familiarize myself with his writing and am thankful for that. The Last Emperox series is good but Old Man’s War is simply on another level. The world building around the CDF and the war fought by humanity is amazing. God I really hope they make this into a series and I hope they get Aaron Sorkin to write it because he can definitely bring to life Scalzi’s dialog's. 

The Old Man’s War series is so human. \[SPOILERS\] Humanities quest to adapt and survive is really shown off in this book with Brainpal and the modifications the soldiers go through.  

Humanity it seems can never get war out of our genes. No matter where we go we seem to stoke or cultivate conflict. I enjoy reading about skip drives and enhanced special forces strategies and tactics but I wonder, for those of you who have read the book, what do you think? 

The decisions made by Perry, Sagan and the colonists on Roanoke. Do you think the CDF should have joined the conclave which sounds to me like a version of the Federation (which I love). I find myself at odds with the decisions made in the series. I cannot stop wondering why didn’t humans attempt to form a conclave themselves and instead picked war?

I believe in the best of humanity and this book in some ways highlights what happens if the worst of us wins somehow. I would like to believe that if our civilization was actually in the same position as the book we would make better decisions. We would choose to elevate ourselves above the warring factions rather than join them and reach an evolutionary standstill locked in by war. 

Once I finish “The Last Colony” I am going to head out and get the other 3 books in the series to discover what happens to John Perry and the rest of humanity so no spoilers please (if possible).",A discussion: John Scalzi's Old Man's War,1596987257
