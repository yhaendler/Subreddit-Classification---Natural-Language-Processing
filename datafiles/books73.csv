books,"I read ten books in 2020. There wasn’t much else to do, this being the year of the pandemic and lockdowns, so I surpassed my usual meagre average of about three books a year. Here is my review of each. 

The first book, *A World Out of Time* by Larry Niven, was a wonky science fiction tale of a man who travels the Milky Way Galaxy for a million years and returns to Earth to find several evolved species of mankind. He is not welcomed by any of them, and the only other human from his era is a murderous woman who hunts him across the new and unfamiliar continents. While I enjoyed the world-building at the beginning and the morbidly fascinating idea of transferring the consciousness of one human being into the body of another, I lost interest upon the main character’s return to Earth. Things got really weird (bubble cars, torture wands, cat-snakes, bald species of super-intelligent children, etc.) and it was all I could do to finish. 

Next up were two books in Spanish. *El Ruido de Las Cosas al Caer* (*The Sound of Things Falling*) by Juan Gabriel Vasquez was a recommendation by a friend. It took place in Bogota, and even though I’ve never lived there, I’ve traveled there enough times to be able to picture the scenes described in the book, especially on the infamous La Septima (one of the city’s largest avenues). One section of the book that I particularly liked was the flashback to a story about a Peace Corp volunteer who falls in love with a local. Their marriage ends tragically, which parallels the fate of the protagonist’s own marriage. *La Perra* by Pilar Quintana was a short read about country life in the Pacific region of Colombia. *La Perra* literally means “the bitch” and the story of an abused woman who takes out her pain on her poor dog. 

Another short read, *Of Mice and Men* by John Steinbeck, was not what I expected from this acclaimed classic. Taking place on a California farm, it had neither the scale nor the complexity that I imagined it would, but it still delivered on the emotional level when friend must turn on friend in the most cruel of ways. 

After that, I read by far my favorite book of the year and easily a part of my top five all time: *The Kite Runner* by Khaled Houseinni. Although never having traveled to Kabul, the story of Amir and Hassan growing up took me back to my own childhood. Like the characters, my time as a boy was spent mostly outside of the house in the wooded areas near creeks and parks with large stones in a time and place that, like Amir, I can never go back to but that will live on in my memory for the rest of my life. The core of the story is that of Amir’s redemption arc. He runs away from his betrayal of his childhood friend, and for many long years he is almost successful in forgetting and burying his old sins. Nevertheless, “a way to be good again” presents itself, and although not without fear and great sacrifice, Amir grabs hold of courage and finally honors his old friend. Houseinni is a gifted writer, his story-telling profound, and I walked away very moved. 

On the heels of *The Kite Runner*, I read another of Houseinni’s novels: *A Thousand Splendid Suns*. The story follows two women who tragically end up in loveless and terribly abusive marriages to the same man. The events of the Taliban’s bloody rise to power in Afghanistan play out in the backdrop of the womens’ stories, and at many points you’re left wondering which narrative is more horrific. Like the Kite Runner, A Thousand Splendid Suns is deeply sorrowful yet ultimately cathartic.

*Brave New World* by Aldous Huxley is like the sibling of George Orwell’s *1984*. While it’s much cheerier on the surface, its message of government control and restricted information and freedoms is not any less scary. The book explores the idea of human genetic engineering, the most shocking aspect of which is that each batch of humans has a pre-planned social status in order to keep society stable, since we can’t all be artists or CEOs. Unlike in *1984*, the world government in Huxley’s novel uses perpetual happiness in the form of a drug to keep its population away from literature, history, or anything that might trigger critical thinking, not that it would really matter, since all humans are chemically altered with severely reduced higher order thinking capacity. The state of humanity and government world order in the book does not seem so far-fetched when compared to the state of affairs in modern terms. The pursuit of endless pleasure is certainly capable of robbing us of our ability to examine ourselves and our societies critically, especially in America where it appears that it is already happening. 

The next book I attempted was Carl Jung’s *Psychology of the Unconscious*. Admittedly, I didn’t make it all the way in this academic, heady pros. A few things I learned were that Jung disagrees with Freud’s notion that all mental illness are somehow connected to sexual perversions, from one’s childhood, namely incest, although he does agree that most mental illness can be traced back to childhood traumas and deficiencies. He also thinks we suffer from the Judas dilemma. We want to do what we please as the masters of our own lives, but with the assurance that God will not damn us for all eternity. Most of his conclusions come from the analysis of a few case studies. I did not find much hard science in terms of designed experiments with a control group and testable hypotheses. Maybe I should have kept reading. 

*Madonna in a Fur Coat* is a pensive and melancholic tale by renowned Turkish writer Sabahatin Ali. He writes of an introverted man who travels to Germany in the early twentieth century to learn about the soap business. This he does half-heartedly as it’s his father’s wish, not his. But while there, he meets a troubled woman who works as an entertainer at a Berlin nightclub. He falls in love almost immediately, but she friendzones him hard. Nevertheless, she enjoys his company and the two become very close, neglecting all other friends to spend time with each other strolling through parks and passionately discussing human emotions and relationships. It reminded me a bit of the movie Before Sunrise if Celine and Jesse had a whole year to walk around getting to know each other instead of just one day. Of course, it ends tragically, and I have to say that I enjoyed the first half of the book more than the latter. Ali must have been an introvert himself because he describes our mindset and outlook of the world so precisely. 

Most recently I read *We Sang Through Tears*, a collection of stories by Latvian survivors of Soviet prison camps during and after WWII. Needless to say, it was a dark and heavy way to end this year’s reading. The accounts of the atrocities are, sadly, almost all the same: unlawful arrests, fabricated charges, deportation on cattle cars to Siberia, years of hard labor, bitter cold, starvation, disease, and death. The Latvian authors are very matter-of-fact in their recounting of the events. Little emotion comes through. I wonder if this has always been Latvian nature or if all emotion was driven out of the survivors during those years of hopeless hardship. As I read I was amazed at the degree of suffering the human body and mind can endure. Although, at the end of each story, even after making it back to their beloved homeland, each author admitted to never being the same again.",My 2020 Book Review List,1609271203

books,"So before August this year, I have not read a novel in around 15 years. The last book I read was one about Elon Musk around 4 years ago. Also I am not native English speaker, but I prefer to read books in English. I also live in LA. 

So thanks to all this Covid thing, I decided I need another hobby, and decided to try reading. Based on a blog post by Bill Gates, for some reason I decided to give Cloud Atlas a shot. And let me tell you, I was struggling the first few days. Especially due to the old language used in the first chapters. 

However, I powered through, and started to enjoy the book more and more. I loved the different timelines, the complexity, the fact I had to re-read some sentences to even understand what is going on. After finishing the book, I kept thinking about it a lot.

Admitting that Cloud Atlas wasn't the best choice for my first novel after 15 years, I decided to browse through reddit for some recommendations. And there seemed to be consensus that The Martian is a great funny book, recommended by almost everyone. 

I am not around 20 pages before finishing the book. I liked how easy it is to read, and I read it much faster than Cloud Atlas. However, sometimes it feels too easy and too straightforward. Pretty much most of the book is: Mark Watney discovers a problem/issue and within half a page he magically is able to solve it because he is probably a genius. And this keeps going on and going on through out the whole book. It just feels too straightforward. 

So Reddit, can you recommend something similar to Cloud Atlas from a story/complexity point of view, but maybe with more modern English? I love movies which play with time - The Prestige, Inception, etc...

My next books I rented from the library are ""The Andromeda Strain"" and ""Jurassic Park"". I also was thinking about ""World War Z"". All these are based on what I read on different reddit posts.

And I like how I don't have to worry about blowing pages or keeping down stifd pages so they don't turn. (some paperbacks are such bad)


But I am very touchy Feely guy... And I hate how in e readers I have to keep 'hands off'. Cuz there is touch screen feature. I like to touch all over the pages and also I like to read along with my fingers sliding across the text..like kids or new learner.

I wish there was an e reader where u can disable touchscreen and only turn using some buttons. That'd help.",My only gripe with e-readers...,1609256980
books,"So as the title here suggests, I'm reading *Station Eleven* by Emily St. John Mandel right now, about a third through. 

I'm very much enjoying the writing generally -- some surprisingly great moments where the author really dials in on the nuance of small experience, the pacing makes it a quick read, love some of the juxtaposition between the past and present -- but there's one huge sci-fi plot hole that is absolutely KILLING ME. 

The general question here (if you're looking to avoid spoilers below) is this: How do you get past something like what seems to be an egregious oversight by an author?


For those who don't mind spoilers...Spoilers below.

Basically in this post-apocalyptic world we're supposed to believe that alternative forms of energy production are important enough to even mention. 

I can't see how solar or wind don't play a part in the energy issue here. All she talks about is gasoline, offhandedly mentioning once or twice that it's all but run out or gone stale.

I can't help but think that the book will go to places that alternative forms of energy existing might be inconvenient and that is why the author has neglected to include them. So my second and third questions are: Have you read the book? What do/did you think of this?",How to get over huge scifi plot hole (reading Station Eleven),1609256672

books,"I feel like I need to talk to someone about this book.


On the surface I really loved it. REALLY loved it.

The book is like a dark Harry Potter, a school of magic where only 1/4 of the students make it out alive. The main character is a snarky, flawed bitch who is focused solely on survival and graduation. Her banter with herself and other characters is great. 

I love the world. The danger. The characters. 


HOWEVER

There have been A LOT of criticisms of Noviks treatment of BIPOC in the book. 

There is a piece of world building where she talks about a monster... but, well, see for yourself: 

*""Dreadlocks are unfortunately not a great idea thanks to lockleeches, which you can probably imagine, but in case you need help, the adult spindly thing comes quietly down at night and pokes an ovipositor into any big clumps of hair, lays an egg inside, and creeps away. A little while later the leech hatches inside its comfy nest, attaches itself to your scalp almost unnoticeably, and starts very gently sucking up your blood and mana while infiltrating further. If you don’t get it out within a week or two, it usually manages to work its way inside the skull, and you’ve got a window of a few days after that before you stop being able to move. On the bright side, something else usually finishes you off quickly at that point.""*

Oof. 

Novik has apologized, and will remove the offending paragraph from future editions. 

I'm glad she has acknowledged her error, but is it enough? I feel that sincere apology and the efforts to make it better are exactly what she should have done. I think that to not accept apologies and attempts to make right just perpetuates the problem. When someone makes a mistake and owns up to it we need to accept it so we can move forward- right? BUT at the same time I acknowledge that because I am not a BIPOC it is easy for me to say that, and I don't know that I have the right to say it. (Idk if that makes sense?) 

The casual racism goes farther than dreadlocks though. Having read reviews from other readers who picked up on things I missed... 

Novik includes a diverse cast of characters in her book... and 99% of them are completely one dimensional. As in they're ""Arabic speaker"" or ""Mandarin speaker"" with no other qualities... 

There is another section of the book where El begins to learn Arabic. The school always gives her material that it thinks is suitable for her doomsday future (murder, death, destruction) and so when she had her first Arabic lesson she gets a worksheet... with a picture of a man driving a car into pedestrians? 

*“Predictably, an Arabic worksheet appeared on my desk the instant I sat down that morning. There wasn’t a single word of English on it; the school didn’t even give me a dictionary. And judging by the cheery cartoonish illustrations next to the lines—most notably a man in a car about to mow down a couple of hapless pedestrians—I had the strong suspicion that it was modern Arabic, too. I should’ve got a book on Classical Arabic out of the library before going to class.”* 

Big oof. 

I get that she was trying to stay with the doom and gloom theme but... she could have done it in a way that didn't scream TERRORIST. Right?

books,"I am a super avid reader and almost always buy my books secondhand. (I’d only use my kindle but I just love physical books so much; can’t resist when I see a good one!) Recently I picked up Colm Tóibín’s The Blackwater Lightship as I’m currently living in Dublin and had enjoyed Brooklyn immensely. Was not disappointed, by the way— his books are so deliciously melancholy. 

What I found odd was that someone had written their own review of the book on the back cover. It was quite biased and negative. I usually try not to mark up any books I’m planning to resell or donate, but I couldn’t help but write a cheeky counter review calling out the previous reader for their blatant homophobia and adding my own $0.02 that it’s worth a read.

It got me thinking that I have never seen a review written like that in any of the hundreds of used books I’ve picked up over the years. I’m curious if anyone else has encountered this, and what you think of it?

books,"[Alex Trebek](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/alex-trebek-mustache-perm.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all) felt like a part of my life. He was in my house every day after school, navigating Jeopardy! contestants through the board with that debonair mix of class, charm, humor, and (maybe a bit of) smugness. I would get off the bus, make a bowl of cereal, and play along with my dad, sister, and the contestants of the day.

He sort of felt like an uncle that visited in the evenings, stayed for a bit, and then had to run.

So when he announced he had pancreatic cancer last year (and when he eventually died of it in late 2020). Well, I wasn’t crushed, but it hit me harder than any celebrity death I can remember. 

So, late this year, I picked up *The Answer Is...Reflections on My Life*, to hang out with Trebek one last time.

The book is split into a whole bunch of ‘mini-chapters’ or short segments, each one posed like a Jeopardy category or clue (The answer is...cars. The answer is...love”...that sort of thing). It is is rough chronological order, but has a meandering vibe. In fact, it feels like someone who knows he is about to die is wandering through the memories of his life one last time--not looking for any special meaning in them, but just visiting old friends. 

So why read it?

**It is so very 70s.**

At least parts of it are. Trebek was hustling the broadcast circuit (and making a name for himself) throughout much of the 70s, and [some of my favorite parts of the book were the moments when 70s culture oozed off the page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZnKJkgmvhI). 

In one memorable scene, Trebek is driving in LA in a [1956 Bentley Mulliner Park Ward Convertible](https://images.classic.com/vehicles/a6346eb7310de7fcb523b4cf2239a26c19eef7da.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;ar=16%3A9) (he was a bit of a car hound), and he pulls up next to Wilt Chamberlain, who has a beautiful blonde in the passenger seat of his Rolls-Royce. Wilt leans out the window and says, “Fine looking car.” To which Trebek responds, “Fine looking companion,” and drives off.

Isn’t that the most 70s LA story you’ve ever heard?

**It Humanizes Trebek.**

This is both good and bad. In some ways, Trebek was like that professor you had in college, where you were hungry for any hint of his personal life. But, with the spotlight always on the contestants, we were often wondering about the man behind the mustache.

Well, this book gives as much of a look at Trebek’s personal life as you’re ever going to get. Even here, though, he is reluctant. He insists a couple times that he didn’t want to write a memoir at all (I’m a second-tier celebrity at best), and there is a reservation in all of the stories he relates. This is not a tell-all. Just like that college professor, there is a lot of reading between the lines.

**It could have been something entirely different.**

In fact, between all of the light anecdotes and Jeopardy fun, there is a darker story. He talks about being born in Ontario, the son of Eastern European immigrants. He talks about a dad who drinks too much, two parents who are poorly suited for one another, growing up in a poor and insatiable household. At one point he falls through the ice and has such painful rheumatism that for 12 years he wakes up in the middle of the night screaming. 

Trebek’s take on all of this? “I have no ghosts. It’s all good.”

**It’s full of shameless (and endearing) Dad Jokes.**

His memoir is a shameless dad-joke extravaganza, largely at his own expense. He is eager to talk about his hairpiece (“a damn good one”). He shares silly photos of himself in all-denim outfits (“wearing the Canadian tuxedo is my birthright”) and posing in the “Got Milk?” campaigns of the 1990s (“I really do love the stuff”). He recalls the early years of “Jeopardy!” with relish, when the prizes for runners-up included “Lee Nails, ‘delicious low-calorie meat’ from Mr. Turkey and Tinactin Antifungal Cream — use only as directed!” 

**It is a tour of Jeopardy!**

This was my favorite part. Trebek talks about the writers, the creators, the producers, and his long-time companion Johnny Gilbert. It is best, though, when he remembers his favorite contestants throughout the year. There is the girl who practices her accordion in the woods behind her house, the man who broke the game, and, of course, Ken Jennings, who--when his 76-game steak ended without ceremony--Trebek describes tearing up as he was closing out the show.

**So should you read it?** 

Probably! At least, if you like this sort of thing.

Ultimately, the book feels like an extended “Getting to know you time”. That segment on Jeopardy after the first commercial break, where each contestant gets 30 seconds to drop fun facts about themselves. Some of it feels pointless, some of it cheesy, and some of it a bit groan-inducing, but it ultimately provides the chance to hang out with Trebek one last time.

**And finally, the lyrics to the Final Jeopardy Theme song (you didn’t know it had lyrics, did you?)**

&gt;*We're in trouble — trouble deep!*  
&gt;  
&gt;*We're imperiled and endangered.*

books,"When the poet Ampleforth was supposed to rewrite a poem for the Party and kept the word ""God"" at the end of a line, which poem was it? In my head I thought it was Gerard Manley Hopkins's ""God's Grandeur,"" but it's apparently a Kipling poem? In the book it says:

""These things happen,"" he began vaguely. ""I have been able to recall one instance -- a possible instance. It was an idiscretion, undoubtedly. We were producing a definitive edition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed the word ""God"" to remain at the end of a line. I could not help it!"" he added almost indignantly, raising his face to look at Winston. ""It was impossible to change the line. The rhyme was ""rod"".

Reading has four levels: (1) elementary, (2) inspectional, (3) analytical, and (4) syntopical. All reading should be active reading, which involves (1) what is the book about as a whole, (2) what is being said in detail, and how, (3) is the book true, in whole or in part, and (4) what of it? Inspectional reading has six stages (1) read the title page and preface, (2) study the table of contents, (3) check the index, (4) read the publisher’s blurb, (5) look at the chapters that are pivotal to the argument, and (6) skim the whole book. Analytical reading has three stages, each with separate parts. The first stage is finding out what the book is about, which involves (1) classifying the book according to subject matter and kind, (2) state what the whole book is about in the utmost brevity, (3) outline the major parts of the book, and (4) define the problems the author has tried to solve. The second stage is interpreting a book’s contents, which involves (1) coming to terms with the author by interpreting key words, (2) grasp the author’s leading propositions by identifying the most important sentences, (3) know the author’s arguments by finding them in sentences, and (4) determine which problems the author has solved, and which he has not, and determine if the author acknowledges his failure to solve. The third stage of analytical reading deals with rules of criticizing a book as a communication of knowledge, which can be divided into two parts (1) general maxims of intellectual etiquette, and (2) special criteria for points of criticism. The maxims of etiquette include (1) do not begin to criticize the book until you have finished your outline and interpretation of the book, (2) do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously, and (3) demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make. The special points of criticism include (1) state wherein the author is uninformed, (2) state wherein the author is misinformed, (3) state wherein the author is illogical, and (4) state wherein the author’s analysis or account is incomplete. In the chapter on history, we should ask (1) what does the author want to prove (what is his thesis), (2) whom does he want to convince, (3) what special knowledge does he assume, (4) what special language does he use, and (5) does he really know what he is talking about? The last level of reading is syntopical reading. It has five steps (1) finding the relevant passages, (2) bringing the authors to terms, (3) getting the questions clear, (4) defining the issues, and (5) analyzing the discussion. Dialectical objectivity is very important. Syntopical reading can be seen in two stages, the first is preparatory and the second is syntopical reading proper. The steps are (1) create a tentative bibliography, (2) inspect all of the books on the bibliography to determine which are relevant, (3) inspect the books identified in step 2 to find the most relevant passages, (4) bring the authors to terms using neutral terminology, (5) establish a set of neutral propositions for all of the authors by framing a set of questions to which all or most of the authors can be seen as giving answers, (6) define the issues by ranging the opposing answers of authors to the various questions on one side of an issue or the other, and (7) analyze the discussion by ordering the questions and issues in such a way as to throw maximum light on the subject (more general issues should precede less general ones).",How to Read a Book (Synopsis) by Mortimer Adler,1609251775

Once arriving but a stone's throw away from the retired philosopher, they then, to a greater degree, hear his truly infinite incantation. Upon registering his words, they fall flat under the shackles of his lechery-inducing brain fruits. After rendering the power-balance between him and his kos topsy-turvy, he lays one hand slightly coiled above his lap (in order to hint that he's not allowed on airplanes as a derivative of the descriptive fact that his manhood has incredible girth), with a slight frown written upon his American countenance accompanied by one of his eyes being left slightly ajar with water quilting the aforementioned orb. Not long after Steinbeck analytically passes on the realization of his opponent’s (or rather victim's) state of impotence, he rassles up the two rather easy wenches, ditching his cane as he leers toward the bathroom. There, he jiggles robustly with his rotund buttocks in front of other men while saying ""live a little"" with a slightly aquaphilic tinge to his speech.
