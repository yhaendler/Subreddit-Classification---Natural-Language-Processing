This year I will finish my degree in Biology and now I am preparing to do an MSc. After having done a couple of projects and internships related to data science during the degree (with R) I have decided that this is the field I want to go in. 

I have been looking at several MCs and basically find 3 different types:

1) Programs like Biostatistics or Bioinformatics (very related to what I studied during the degree, and therefore, I don't know if they could give me job options outside academy( this programs usually teach  R and Python basics)

2)Statistics programs (pure mathematics but with opportunities in many fields  (Advance R programming))

3)mixed programs such as computational biology  where statistical concepts, ML, AI, databases and biology concepts are covered. 

One factor to consider is that I wouldn't mind working outside my field (natural science) although I think it will be easier to find something on it because of my background.

I’m hoping someone can help me wrap my head around this. I’m interested in the more experimental/CI side of DS so I’ve been reading up on AB testing and learning about the problems that can go with it if carried out improperly. I don’t understand peeking. 


I know that an AB test is an RCT and that under the frequentist fixed horizon approach you choose an n and then wait until that is reached to evaluate the results. So, I understand that trying to stop before hand would be wrong but only in the sense that it “goes against the rules”. I don’t understand the mechanics/math of why it’s wrong and how peeling so dramatically inflates the false positive rate. I’ve read the Evan Miller article and about 20 other blogs/papers on it in search of finding an example I can understand bc usually once I read things enough times I can get it. But not with this one and it’s driving me crazy.


I think part of the issue is that I was a social science major and learned about RCT done the traditional way so I don’t even understand what people are doing. People in my company are always talking about ‘continuing a test bc it’s not significant yet’ or ‘stopping a test bc it looks bad’ but that makes no sense to me! How can you decide sample size as you go along? Isn’t waiting for significance just ensuring mistakes because you’re essentially waiting to be shown a difference even if there is none? But, at the same time if you reach at large enough n and decide to stop ahead of time why does that so badly mess everything up?


At this point, I’m so confused I no longer even know what I’m confused about so im sorry if this makes no sense.

datascience,"Dear Redditors,

I am a computer science engineer. For the last few months I have been learning ML. My intention is to build a easy to use free GUI web tool for ML which can be used by business/domain experts who understand the data but may not fully understand how ML works. The web tool will also have enough options for data scientists to tinker around as well. I have looked around and haven't yet found an easy to use free web tool. I have found some which needs to be installed on the computer. But in this age of cloud computing, I was put off by that idea.

The main limitation I found in existing tools, is when it comes to publishing and using the model. The services generated over the model expects the input to be normalized/feature engineered. This leads to additional work of manipulating the data before using the service. The predicted result is also normalized/feature engineered. Hence the result needs to be reversed into its original form. This again leads to more work.

I would like to build the the web tool where the above works out of the box.

My approach is to build it as a wizard so that the users can simply follow the steps in order.

Upload Data -&gt; Select Normalization/Feature Engineering Options-&gt;Select data split range ( Training vs Testing)-&gt; Select ML Model-&gt;Train ML Model-&gt; Publish Model

Publishing the model will generate - 

1. Webservice (REST service) - Which takes the original data as input and the predicted result is also in the original form and not in normalized/feature engineered form.
2. GUI (web URL) - Which allow users to input the values or upload a file to get the predicted outputs.

I am half way done with the implementation. I would like this community's opinion. What limitations do you see in the existing GUI tools ? What sort of features do you want to see in such tools ? Would you use such a web tool?

datascience," Hi everyone,

I understand that there are a multitude of posts regarding how to break into Data Science (DS) without a CS degree or PhD; however, I haven't seen one discussing what non-CS, non-PhD Data Scientist do once they're one in terms of career prospects. I hope this post will allow those type of people to share their experiences.

I’m a new age Product/Analytics Data Scientist (mix of Business Intelligence using SQL/Python/Tableau and using ML for impact analysis, but limited data engineering and no production-level ML). Having worked for several months, I have become keenly aware of several things about myself:

1. I lack the CS background required for high-level data engineering (setting up data lakes from scratch; ETL automation; deploying a ML model to production);
2. I do not enjoy the high-level mathematics that will be required to become a ML Engineer (building and optimising cutting-edge algorithms);
3. I lack the economics/finance background to become an DS Economist (focusing on econometrics).

In short, due to my background, I feel like I’m a half-baked DS who can only remain as a Product/Analyst DS, unless I put a ludicrous amount of time and effort to overcome my (MSc in structural engineering) background and specialise. Similarly, it’ll be very difficult for me to become a non-specialised “full-stack” DS which is highly sought in small-midscale startups. I’ve also been told that DS Managers who lack technical/specialised expertise are unable to climb far in the management career ladder (say Head of Data), which means just remaining in my current position will likely be a bad move in the long term.

For those that are a similar situation, what did you end up doing and how did it work out? Did you grit your teeth and specialise, or did you end up switching careers? Please share your experiences!","As a non-CS, non-PhD Product/Analytics Data Scientist with limited prospects in becoming a Data Engineer or Machine Learning Engineer, I'm concerned about my long-term job satisfaction and career path.

datascience,"Hi all,

This is my first post in this group, so let me introduce my self. I am 29F working in London in big corp within data. I have a degree in business studies and no masters. (Not considering going back to uni again.) I spent last 5 years in the same company progressing from support data analyst to data analyst and then to lead data analyst/team lead. I feel like it is time for me to grow further, but inside my current company progression is most likely will be delayed by another year. In addition I also feel like my current company is not the best place to learn cutting age technology and have lots of exciting analytical projects. So I am thinking of going somewhere else, but not sure what skills I need to improve before applying for junior data scientist. 


In my current job I spent 20% managing team, 30% managing clients and delivering additional ad hoc analytics , 30% dealing with client requests when something doesn’t work as planned (api’s don’t return expected data, errors in company data, DSAR requests...), 10% ad hoc analytics for small projects (mainly matching clients portfolios with data in companies data base and appending data to it according to client specifications), 10% setting up new projects for technical customer support for new company products (setting up projects + dashboards in Jira and Service Now, and writing documentation in Confluence (translating code to English)).

In my current jobs I mainly use PL/SQL, Excel, bat files (not exciting stuff). In my spare time I also learned Python, Tableau, and a bit of R. I am not that advanced with statistics. I have Udacity nano degree in data analytics, completed python courses Udemy and now doing data science path with Corsera. I also started Python blog and doing my own data analytics projects in Python to up-skill myself. 

The problem is time. It is not enough of it, so I need to prioritize development of some skills over other ones. Please help me prioritize. What do you think is more important for the switch in to the data science?

I will also welcome other job propositions within data field that pay 45-50k and lead to more highly paid opportunities after a year or two.

datascience,"I'm researching practical steps that data science teams can take to ensure model fairness. If you practice data science in a regulated environment or where your work has the potential to significantly impact the wellbeing of people, I'd love to hear how you go about identifying bias in your data and models, and ensure model fairness. 

There's been plenty recent research into model fairness and bias, but not yet much discussion around processes and practices that data science teams can adopt to systematically address these areas. (The [FairDM model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00176v2) is an interesting start, though.)

Some thoughts on how one might go about building fairness into standard practices:

# Exploratory data analysis includes evaluation for systemic biases
- Analysis of data includes removal or marking of features that are either directly related to protected sub-groups / classes (or similar) or are highly correlated with same.
- Data augmentation with public or proprietary datasets in order to achieve the above (e.g. augment zip codes with race distributions from census data in order to identify other features correlated with race).
- Analyze the risk that the training data itself is biased and likely to perpetuate systemic biases.

# Model training evaluation
- Evaluate metrics by subgroup (for e.g. false positive rate by gender)
- Understand feature importance, model interpretation using SHAP/ LIME etc. Potentially slicing by subgroups.

# Post-hoc analysis of production inference results
- Alongside regular model monitoring, evaluate metrics by subgroup/class.

What other practices are used by your teams?

What tools and frameworks do you use to do the above? Aside from general-purpose data analysis tools available to R/Python/etc users, that is.",Model fairness: Practical steps to avoid bias?,1578884643

datascience,"Hey there, I'm trying to change careers and I have no idea how to go about it. Data Science piqued my interest because of pay at first. But for the last few months, I've seen how powerful the ability to make sense out of raw numbers and actually make meaningful decisions in the private and public sector is. So I want to give it a go.

But some background first. You can keep that paragraph if you want. It's just there to help you get an idea of what I've been dealing with

I graduated almost 2 years ago with a BS in math and after failing to get into grad school, I have been working for the past 2 years as a teacher for people suffering from dyslexia. I always thought about going back into some math related field, but I was too cowardly to get out there and take on debt. Especially when I see the shit my cousins with outstanding debt are going through. I live with my parents and they are honestly the sweetest people in the world. I wanted to be able to help support them so I thought of maybe rising up where I am currently working.  However, as I see new people coming into my workplace get promoted because they're certified or at least academically trained in education while I'm just getting the same work with the same pay, I think my time is up.

I think that going to school for a master's program is inevitable at this point and since nothing is free, I guess I gotta take on the debt. I have a few school programs in mind. I didn't take the GRE yet nor do I have the cash ready for it, but I'm planning on taking it then apply to a few schools. But in the meantime, what skills/languages/whatever can I try to learn so that I don't walk into the program looking like a deer in the headlights?

To give you an idea of our direction so far, we’re building:

* True-Serverless: manage only your models, we do the rest. No more fighting with Kubernetes or Lambda as a Data Scientist
* Automatic versioning to track configuration and hyper-parameter changes
* Continuous testing and validation of your models against real production data
* Monitor and plot key metrics: such as class distribution, requests per second, and latency curves in real-time
* Configure triggers and alerts for detection of concept drift
* Shadow mode: profile and compare your models before they’re customer facing with real data
* Integration with mobile, modern and legacy systems
* Developer-First APIs to integrate ML models into your product codebase
* Support for interoperability between languages. Regardless of what language your model is written in, it can be automatically deployed into production
* Deployment in one function call
