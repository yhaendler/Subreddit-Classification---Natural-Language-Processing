datascience,"Sorry for the long post and background info, but I was hoping to get some advice from people in the field about making a career switch into Data Science but I feel my situation is a bit unique in that I really don't have any formal technical background.   


I graduated undergrad in '07 with a degree in Economics. After that I became an attorney and practiced a big law firm for about 5 years before becoming burnt out and moving in-house to a real estate tech start-up where I headed up the operations side of things for the past 3 years before it eventually folded. While there I got to work closely with the data science team and found myself really interested in what they do.   


I have no desire to go back into pure law and would really like to see if it makes sense at this stage in my career to make a change and if so, get some opinions on the best way to do it. Just to make it clear I have no mathematics background beyond Calc II in college nor do I have any formal CS classes besides an intro class in college, though I have done some basic programming on my own in Python and C++ and generally find it interesting/intuitive.   


Most of the people on the data science team in my former job did not have ""Data Science"" degrees but were either PhDs or Masters students in a hard science that applied their skills to become data scientists. One of those PhDs took a data science bootcamp before joining. But when talking to them, they advised taking a bootcamp without any formal math or CS education wasn't a great use of time or money and that they often rejected applicants who took this route because they really didn't have a comprehensive handle on the skills needed.   


I've seen some Masters degrees specifically for data science (some from well known schools), but does anyone know if these are geared for people without a tech background or would those types of people find themselves left behind? Does anyone have recommendations for other Masters programs that may not be data science specific but that would make myself more marketable if this is the case (e.g. get a masters in CS or some type of engineering) or if just taking some discrete courses at a community college might get me up to speed before applying to a Masters in Data science? I would love to be able to do this as quickly and with as little cost as possible, but am also in the position to spend some time doing this if that would be what makes me most competitive.

datascience,"Hi there,

I would like to get some career advice in reddit. Now I am statistics student and follow some people's suggestion from previous posts.

In this reddit, I know some of people do not recommend pursuing degrees in Data Science or Business Analytics. They suggest people should go for CS or STAT depending on personal interst.

**Background**

* An international student who wants to find an internship or a job in the U.S.
* Master statistics student without any experience in data science or software engineering
* Career Goal: I want to find a data science intern, but I think at this point the chance to get one is not high.

**Qestion**

Originally, I think statistics students could get a job easily, but at this point it is really tough. In my school, professors have a high-standard on us, so many statistics courses are really tough and I could not spare more time on Leetcode problems. Sometimes I feel frustrated. I thought I tried really hard and might get A. But, finally, I just got B. At the same time, I could not find an internship. It made me feel really down. And, a lot of people around me say PhD students could do data scientist jobs in big tech companies and those companies are more willing to accept PhD students.

What's more, in school, I took Objected-oriented programming and am taking Data Structures and Algorithms to complement my CS skills. The reason I took some CS courses is that I originally plan to apply for OMSCS degree after graduation, but if I could not find a job after graduation. I think I do not need to apply for this kind of program.

All in all, it leads me to wonder whether I should change my major or double major. In my school, there is a degree(Computational Science and Engineering) which is somewhat similar as a CS degree, but there is still a little difference. 

***Option1: Double Major***

Pros:

1. Expand my skillset. I will take more courses like NLP, CV or Text mining, etc.
2. Get my statistics degree. In the beginning, I like statistics, but grad-level courses are not so easy.
3. Maybe I could apply for SWE or SDE if I could crack some medium or hard leetcode problems
4. Solid training from both CSE and STAT

Cons:

1. Spend more money and time (BTW, I am 26 now.)
2. Job Uncertainty
3. Not my original plan

***Option 2: Change Major***

Pros:

1. Less time compared with option 1
2. Not limited to DS. Instead, I could do SWE or SDE jobs.

Cons:

1. Sunk Cost. (I'm not really bad at coding, but I should work really hard to keep up with CS guys.)

***Option 3: Stay the same***

Pros:

1. Continue studying statistics
2. Less time and money (I might graduate this December)

Cons:

1. Not so many career opportunities

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, next semester, I would take a deep learning course and information visualization course, but if I double major or change major, I could take more Artificial Intelligence courses, like NLP and Computer Vision. Just like Andrew Ng said, someone who wants to stay in Artificial Intelligence should develop T-shaped knowledge base.

Vote with btc, eth, dai, or any other shit coin you might have!

Dump your shitty airdrops and help develop open voting data and methods!

Uses address values to signal global support for a candidate and the global importance of the overall United States Presidential Elections. Address values before, during, and after Tuesday November 3, 2020 should correlate with various stages of support, a winner/loser, and the global reach of the election and this poll. Might provide more insight if paired with data from other sources, because this is the first election cycle and test of vote.via.eth there will be no past polls to compare it to. Please Provide feedback if nothing else. Global participation welcomed.

[vote.via.eth | vote2020.via.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/vote.via.eth)

International voters should use ether of the addresses above to signal that the election is important without making a candidate selection.

[NoConfidence2020.via.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/NoConfidence2020.via.eth)

Voters should use this address to signal distrust in the United States Government and its voting process.

=== Cost of Participation ===

You forfeit whatever value you choose to send (btc, eth, dai, or any other shit coin), make sure its an amount you are comfortable forfeiting/donating/losing. Obviously this poll/vote will not be used to pick the next President of the United States.

=== Benefits of Participation ===

1. A public and verifiable vote, proof that it effected the outcome of this poll.
2. Reasonable belief that the participates in this poll made an honest choice in their selection with full knowledge of its costs. One rich guy can skew the polls but forfeiture of the underlying value is what keeps the poll as honest as possible. Are you really willing to forfeit X amount to show support for Y candidate? Both lying and telling the truth have the same outcome, you forfeit the value and your vote is recorded. Its in everyone best interest to tell the truth.
3. A free (beer&amp;speech) pseudo-anonymous data set, hosted on the blockchain, with the following associated keywords {internet, voting, ethereum, bitcoin, value}
4. A test case in blockchain voting/polling.

=== Questions ===

Q. Why [Honest/Costly Signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory)

A. Because a vote has value.

Q. How can I vote using BTC?

A. Each address has an associated Multi:Coin BTC address viewable using [https://ens.domains](https://ens.domains/) or [https://myetherwallet.com](https://myetherwallet.com/)

Q. What will happen to the value I voted with?

A. If you have to ask, vote with a smaller value or a shittier coin.

Q. Voting with money is a terrible idea

A. Voting with money is a terrible idea agreed, some of us have it some don't. voting with some random token (shitcoin) or any value amount you're indifferent about isn't.

Q. It should be 1 vote per person which is in no one way controlled or verifiable here.

A. Sending 1shitcoin is the same as sending .5shitcoin twice but less expensive.

Q. There's no enforcement of any modern voting mechanisms like rank choice voting.

A. It measure support by using Honest/Costly Signalling. Both lying and telling the truth have the same outcome, you lose your value and your vote is recorded. Its in everyone best interest to tell the truth.

Q. Definitely seems like you are just trying to get people to send you crypto.

A. I'm trying to get people to vote in a open, reliable, and verifiable way (It uses ens to make it easy to vote, anyone with a mobile wallet can). It states upfront vote with \[Eth, Btc, or any other Shitcoin\] and upon voting you forfeit the value. I won't get into the mechanisms used but i can guarantee that after voting you will not have that value so vote honestly and only send an amount you wont notice or the most shit shitcoin you can. You can even make a random token (MyShitCoin) and send it. The value \~$0 is used to record your vote.

Q. No one can trust the owner of those wallets.

A. This is a big fact that is true for any project and wallet. Good thing the trust isn't in the wallets its in the blockchain, even with the via.eth keys I can't change your vote. Forfeit \~$0 of value &gt; Get your vote recorded with the benefits listed above.","(Vote.Via.Eth) Open Voting/Polling Data Using Honest/Costly Signals.

datascience,"I have one year left in university and I'm debating if I should get a masters degree or not. For context, I'm majoring in math &amp; cs with a minor in stats. Some of the relevant courses I've taken are calc (1-4), linear algebra (3 courses), data science theory, and a CS machine learning course. In my final year of uni I plan on taking \~6 more stats courses as well. By the time I graduate I will have had two data science internships (4 months each) and various projects related to data science under my belt.

From the research I've done, an accelerated 1 year masters in data science would cost roughly $50,000-$70,000 for tuition and living expenses depending on the university. I would also not be able to start working for a year so that would add to the opportunity cost as well. This means the total opportunity cost of getting a masters degree would be $100,000+ depending on my starting salary out of uni.

&amp;#x200B;

Basics first. I live in Italy, I turned 24 in January and I am in my final year in a engineering master's degree. Here almost any STEM path follows the 3+2 pattern, so I should have graduated at 23. My ""official"" course is Aeronautical Engineering, and why ""official"" will be clear in a minute. 

Context: some pretty standard stuff at the beginning... I loved motorsport since I was a child and my dream was to work for Ferrari in F1 (yes, Italians and their stereotypes lol). Always loved maths and physics, and I was very good at school, so I chose engineering being 100% sure it would have been the right choice for pursuing my dreams, and I chose aeronautical because I was particularly interested in aerodynamics. Plus, the ""plan B"" it carried along was much more appealing to me that what I would have found in mechanical engineering, for example. All good throughout the Bachelor years, I graduated with top marks and perfectly in time, and I was also part of the FSAE team for 2 years. I wrote my thesis on FSAE rear wing CFD analysis, then moved to a bigger university for my master's. This was late 2017/early 2018, and it's when it all changed.

My interests were radically evolving, although too slowly. Had it happened a year before, I would have known what to do right away. Anyhow, I got accepted into a 6 months workshop organized by companies in the italian Motor Valley, specifically for forming Race Engineers. I got a taste of what I loved so much... Exept I hated it. I met the best engineers at Pirelli, Dallara, Brembo and so on, all leading companies in the motorsport world, and I was shown what the job actually looked like. It was none of what I expected. I won't enter in details, but I was so disappointed both in the professional and personal aspect of that career. 

I talked about evolving interests before. As I said, it's been a very slow process, approximately from when I left highschool till last year, driven mainly by personal life event which led me to always meet/hang around/grow with people very far from ""my field"". Again, I won't enter in details, but I got involved in politics, which led me to get interested in history, economics, sociology, marketing, psychology, communication, electoral campaing management and so on, you name it. It basically opened a world to me, who had always and only read about physics, math, science in general, cars... Now I like to say that I was shifting my attention from ""things"" to ""people"", I know it may sound really bad and ""lefty"" and conceited, but I don't know how to phrase it better, so I'll try to explain. I started to think about whether it was possible to use what I learnt and was learning to approach this ""social science"" experiences I was having. Like... Is it possible to use math for predicting election results like I can predict if a wing will stall or not? Is it possible to use math for learning something about social behavior as I can learn something about beam stresses? Can I use math, as a ""language"", to approach ""people things"" as well as ""objects things""?

Of course, that's when I met statistics for the first time. I mean, not the first first time, I took STAT101 during the bachelor, but the first time I saw it applied (to quality control and reliability). From there, it's been a straightforward path: I learned about data science, applied statistics, statistical and machine learning, game theory, AI etc... I was HAPPY: yes, it was indeed possible to use ""math"" for ""people things"", and actually all around me (I felt so stupid actually). I modified my study plan, within the small allowed limits, and I took a statistical learning class. I met the most compelling professor I had ever met, who took us trough a six month group project competition (we got to choose out preferred field, and I was able to work on survey analysis for the Italian 2018 elections... Imagine my face like \*\_\_\* lol). He wasted 3 hours one afternoon listening to my situation and giving me some advice, after which I decided to prolong my degree by 8 months in order to take additional classes before starting my thesis. In the meantime, around March last year, I got the opportunity to help a to-be candidate to the European Elections on strategy, data analysis and social network/campaign planning. It's been an awesome experience and we had great results considering how little time we had, falling short of just a few hundred preferences from getting a spot. The thing actually kept going after the elections, and I'm still in the team. 

Which brings me to now. As I said before, I changed my study plan as suggested by my professor to include some related classes. You can actually add as many classes as you want from every field you want and take the exams, they will appear on your degree certificate but they won't count for earning graduation credits nor does the grades count for the final mark. So I still have to do my mandatory exams (right now I have 2 and a half left) plus this others (that's the reason for the delay). They include: 

* Web Information Retrieval (already taken, and I worked on a project regarding fake news)
* Deep Learning and Neural Networks (it was last semester, due to the aforementioned family issues I couldn't study for it, I'm hoping to have the time for it this summer, it focuses also on image recognition and the use of Keras)
* Machine Learning (classes begin now \[fun fact: coronavirus is forcing to have classes on Microsoft Teams, and I'm almost quarantined in my home\])
* Data Intelligence Applications (economics, pricing algorithms, web adverstising, bandit algorithms, matching problems)
* Data Mining and Text Mining (NLP) 

What I have in my background:

* Multivariate applied statistics, from descriptive all the way to regression, classification/clustering, PCA, functional data analysis and geostatistics. The courses have been VERY focused on theory, pure Italian university style if you happen to know it.
* Good knowledge of R, can improve of course
* Basic knowledge of C++
* Learning Python
* Good knowledge of Matlab
* Numerical modeling, again very hard on theory, FEM/CFD software (anyway, I haven't touched these in more than a year).
* Bayesian estimation, Kalman filtering (applied to aeronautics)
* Linear and Nonlinear Programming, optimization theory in general, graphs and networks etc... (applied to aeronautics)

What I'm working on outside university: 

I'm starting to use R and Python for creating something useful for the elections team, Right now I learned how to use Facebook, Instagram and Twitter APIs to extract the data using Python, and I'm using R for initial analysis. The plan is to deliver ""features"" over time, starting with this social network analysis, then I'd like to add some text processing, some demographics analysis, maybe something related to content. I would love to be able to create an UI or dashboards, and maybe in the future have the knowledge to produce something useful for managing the campaigns. Or I'd like to work on something more related to policy analysis/evaluation.

What I'm struggling on:

I don't know what to do with my life. I don't know which thesis to work on, I don't know if I can work on something not related to aeronautics, I don't know how bad it is to have a STEM degree but wanting to work in a different field wrt what you studied. There are so many things I'd love to do, so many things I'd hate to do. I'm worried that I am a ""Jack of all trades, master of nothing"", that I won't be considered a good option in the jobs world because I'm half an engineer and half another one. I don't understand what I lack, what I need to focus on (for example, I don't know anything about databases, computer architecture, software development). I don't know what my job could look like, what I could end up doing and if it's satisfying or not, I don't know what to aim to nor what I can aim to. I'm quite lost, basically.

If there's anyone who has read till here, I sincerely thank you. I'd love to hear your opinion. I understand that it's a lot, and one may not want to write a lot. Feel free to PM me if you have some suggestion and you prefer a more direct conversation.
