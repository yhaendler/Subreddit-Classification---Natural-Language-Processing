 I'm working with financial reconciliation data and the ask is to train the algorithm to match transactions (that are otherwise manually matched if the existing application didn't because not all the rules were met).

Link to what the data looks like -  https://imgur.com/va5LcX9 

The **Currency, Account, Client** *have* to be the same, the **Settle &amp; Trade dates** of each item can be the same or vary, the **Net Settlement** should ideally be 0 (when the sign for one item is flipped) or as close to 0. The rest of the columns aren't as helpful because they can be blank or vary for the same match.

So if for 2 rows of data the currency, account &amp; client are the same, one of the dates varies by 1 day &amp; the settlement difference is 0.50 - they're reconciled (or at least tagged as an 80% match or a partial/possible match). *In the attached picture - for the 2nd set, 3 items are reconciled - the difference is -48 and the dates vary a bit.*

There are also instances where it's 5+ (upto thousands) items of data all being part of the same transaction (this makes my head hurt and the math aspect of it makes this seem easy but it doesn't always become 0 and looking at the ""training"" data makes no sense :( ) I was wondering if this is feasible, what would be the best method(s) - algorithm, language, libraries etc., For a start, just being able to classify only 2 (not more) exact (same amount) matches would be great. I do have access to plenty of training data. I have only worked with R &amp; Python for analysis/simple predictions and this was over 1 year ago.

datascience,"**Backstory:**

I am going through a career change where I was initially going to become a network engineer. I have worked in various telecom roles as a network analyst or hardware technician and obtained some certifications in CCNA, etc. However, while working towards that goal, I realized I enjoyed the nuances of finding out what interests customers in the product/service they are using and utilizing data to uncover potential correlations. This leads me back to college and to pursue my bachelor's degree in CIS. I have learned concepts in basic stats, intro data mining, intro python/pandas, R, data warehousing, SQL, C++. I still work a full time unrelated job and full time studies. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue at Hand:**

I'm in my final year where an overwhelming imposter syndrome has taken over. Throughout my early career I felt comfort in learning on the job while also learning at home. What can I do to reach my goal? I know I plan to in the future go for a MS to get a deeper knowledge to work towards a data science role. But I feel lost about my capabilities. School projects are interesting, but never feels like it dives in enough from beginning to end. I also just feel so behind because I am much older than my classmates. They seemingly have a stronger programming repertoire given they learned it for many more years than I have. I also think about how can I strengthen my product critical thinking when I have not taken anything related to HCI, or the likes of it.

datascience,"I am interested to get into data science and have been taking math/CS classes at a local CC. I enjoy what I’ve learned so far and am doing well. Since I already have a degree (irrelevant field) I am left with only a few degree options near where I live, and data science is one of them. (I wanted to get either an Applied Math/Statistics degree and learn programming on my own but most of these programs don’t admit students who already have a degree.) 

From what I know, the DS program is a few years old, is under the university’s statistics department, and requires about 50% CS and 50% statistics courses to graduate. The school is a public school and is research-oriented. If possible, I  want to attend grad school later in life to specialize in either statistics or applied math.

So my questions are: Am I wasting my time? Is a degree in DS usually frowned upon? I’ve read some other posts here on reddit saying that a degree in DS is a “buzzword” degree, and it is not worth it. But my thinking is, every department/program was new once, not to mention, most of the courses are the same courses that CS and Statistics majors take. And to be fair, I don’t have a lot of options. I’m not sure if I’m just trying to talk myself into applying to this program because I’m desperate to get into data science, and I am also not sure if it’s a good idea to get a degree in something that seems so specialized even though the curriculum seems ok (or not?) to me.

His phrase was ""Slow to hire, but quick to fire"", which instantly sounded like a red flag to me. Other than that, he seemed pretty cool, the teams sound hip and fun, and the work they do is pretty interesting. I'm relatively new and trying to break in to data science. Did a lot of statistical/math modeling before and more recently some machine learning projects on my own time but that's it. 

People who've been the field, is this a big red flag? I have another offer that's more stable but the work is less interesting and not my ideal location. Any advice/input would be appreciated.

datascience,"In the past months/years I have noticed that the mood in the data science community is changing. It seems as if every project is doomed to failure. One could also get the impression that almost no ML engineer or data scientist is working with real machine learning. I want to point out that it is not as bad as it seems in this subreddit.

I have been working in this field since before the hype started, and it is true that there have been exaggerations. Especially in the media, an incredible number of things were promised that could not be kept. Suddenly, machine learning was to be used anywhere where a little thinking was the solution.

However, very exciting AI systems have been built, which also provide great value. There are successful start-ups that have achieved really big things with ML. Yes, and there are the Data Scientists/ML Engineers, who have created value in the company with neural networks and also really do a lot of machine leaning, aside form simple regression/XGB.

It is not like at university, where new algorithms are invented and research is done. Much of it is craftsmanship and plumbing, but still machine learning is often the core of such systems. I personally was involved with several ML system, a lot of them still in production and generating value.

I think another reason for the shift is that there was an inflation of data science job titles from people entering the field with 6 months bootcamps. I don't want to gate keep, but you can not expect to play on the same level as people with several years exp (phds, masters, self-taught whatever). Don't take job titles to serious.

I also don't want to make false promises, there is more supply than demand for AI jobs. A lot of people entered the field for the money, however if you are passionate about AI and ML and did your studies (not a 3 months bootcamp, sorry) people will notice. There might be a lot of supply, but not a lot of good supply.

One last advice: Don't be too much focused on FANG. I have some friends at FANG and a lot of them are unhappy with their work, optimizing KPIs, very few exiting ml stuff, but the money has them. They can't go anywhere else with a massive financial drawback. Focus an smaller companies with good ideas and tech related mindset.

I'm very new to DS and am not even sure how to ask this question. 

I would like to predict categorical variable, binary or ideally even more from time series data. 

To make this more concretely: 

Say that I have two events: Event A and Event B
For each event, I have time series data of the probability of each Event happening. So at some point t I would have a 54% probability of Event A happening and at some point (t+1) I would have, say, a 58% probability of Event A happening. Then, at some point (t+n) I know the outcome of the experiment ie does Event A happen or does Event B happen. 

I would like to know how can I predict which event will happen based on the fluctuation of the predicted probability.

To that end, I've done pretty damn well for myself (I'm now in FAANG), but lately have been wondering where I go from here. I'm not in the least bit interested in becoming a senior DE - the idea of being too concerned about the ""E"" part doesn't sit well with me.

I've started seriously thinking about transitioning to a DS role since a recent secondment in my current company to support an area of the business with no DE or DS support. I therefore had to pick up responsibilities from both disciplines - building out data pipelines and core tables, and interrogating said core tables for insights that will direct the teams goals and the right metrics to understand customer behaviour and measure our success.  When we finally got DS support in the team, my reaction should have been ""Yes! Now I can go back to doing DE stuff full time!"", but it was the complete opposite - I actually felt a little sad that I'd no longer be doing DS stuff!
