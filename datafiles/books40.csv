books,"Hey Reddit friends!

I am currently reading the Martin Beck detective series by Maj Sjöwell and Per Wahlöö. I am really enjoying it so far, but I have noticed that the authors constantly refer to characters by their first and last name. Even the main character. Constantly. 

I’ve read a lot of books, and I recall mainly only Russian literature that does this.

Do you guys know if this is more common in certain books from certain countries? I’d love to find out more.","The current book I am reading constantly refers to characters by their full names, rather than their first names (even after being introduced)",1594769219

books,"Hey friends! This was my day today- at a mere 250 pages/6 and a half hour audiobook, it didn't take too long for me to finish this! I know some folks were curious so I wanted to share my thoughts!

How do you nurture a sociopath?

If you were not aware, this book is written by Donald Trump's niece Mary. It is a VERY short book, but it is very good and entertaining 100% of the way through.

So let's break down a little bit about what this book is exactly. You aren't going to find any state secrets here. For anyone asking ""Why Didn't Mary speak out earlier"", this is addresses, but this is isn't a political expose. At it's heart, Too Much and Never Enough is a story about an extremely twisted family, that is much about the other Trumps as it is Donald.

Nothing in this book would sway a true believer. Nothing here is going to rock the world of an undecided voter- because this is a book about who the Trumps are as people. We have already seen Trump mock women, non white folks, disabled people. We have seen him do so many evil things. If you don't know who Trump is by now, I don't really know what to say about you. Too Much and Never Enough is this woman's catharsis- its a way for her to release her trauma. Her book chronicles essentially, how she was became disenchanted with her family before 45 ever decided to run for office, how she was disinherited, and where Fred Trump comes into play as a lynchpin at the center of it all.

Mary's father, Fred Trump junior, was an outlier. Not necessary a good man, but a complicated one who had made a number of visible mistakes before she was even born. She describes his dark relationship with his brother, and her father's slow physical and mental decline as he falls out of favor with Fred Senior. Much of this book is really told through her father's eyes, and through the stories he told her before his passing.

Mary's grandfather Fred is also hi lighted as an abuser that gaslit and traumatized his children, saw the evil in his own younger son, and then raised him as an ideal son to take on the family name. Fred Senior's cruelty towards everyone around him, and shady business practices help shaped the monster we now know today as 45.

As for Donald Trump- Mary uses a number of personal and family stories to paint a picture of Trump's youth. Trump's behavior doesn't come out of thin air, and Mary is really able to paint a picture of 45 at his darkest, which started at a much earlier age than some may expect. These personal stories are chilling and callous- often reflecting his relationships with the American people during his four years as president.

You get some interesting little tidbits about ""modern"" behavior from the family as well, from small squabbles to election night anecdotes. Imagine the literary families of Long days Journey Into the Night or Haunting of Hill House. The Trump family in Mary's book is almost laughably literary ""broken wealthy"". The story of the rise and fall of the Trumps plays out like a screenplay. Later on in the book, Mary talks a lot more about contending with Donald and the family personally as she is disinherited. 

I highly recommend Too Much and Never Enough, even if you don't find yourself often drawn towards non fiction- if only because this is a simple and easy to follow biography that helps us understand how we got where we are now. How Donald Trump, against all odds, rose in the ranks of his own family from a younger ""second son"", and ended up making all of us pay for his neurosis.

I think most folks would go into this worried that Mary is providing excuses or sympathy for her family, and I can assure you that is not the case. Mary is an exceptional author and intelligent woman who makes no excuses for her family, and manages to tell a hard and painful story with striking objectivity and honesty.",I read Too Much and Never Enough (Mary Trump's book) and finished it today!

books,"I work at an independent bookshop, and worked for 5 or so years in graphic design. I love seeing design trends appear on new books we get in, but I also am very disappointed when I see lazy looking designs that are clearly stock images thrown together.

It really bothers me to flip to the back and see ""Shutterstock"" credited for the artwork. In the case of *The Ten Thousand Doors of January*, a book I am currently reading, Shutterstock is credited along with a graphic designer. This means they paid a graphic designer, who lazily chose to search something like ""door, flowers, rustic"" and throw together cheap illustrations. I call it ""lazy"" because I used to do the same exact thing for clients who were rude or who's projects I could tell they definitely weren't passionate about.

Alix E. Harrow said she spent 3 years writing this book! And the graphic designer just took the easy route with their yearly Shutterstock subscription. The images also don't correlate with the text (4 different fonts, flowers?), which makes me even more disappointed because Harrow gives incredible imagery within the first few chapters. [I even put together an example of an alternate book cover myself](https://imgur.com/gallery/torBOkY), just so I could envision a different set of colors and imagery that I thought fit the story.

I think being self-conscious of one's appearance or at least assessing one's physical looks/attractiveness is a very human thing to do, even at least once in your life.  I also feel that physical appearance is something that people really consider, whether unconsciously or not, and therefore judge people on; sadly, if someone is below average intelligence or mentally lacking as Charlie was, people would view them more favourably if they found them attractive or good-looking. 

Charlie never describes these thoughts. Though he might not have considered it pre-operation, I feel that in post-operation, he would have at least pondered it. Since post-operation Charlie really considered a lot of aspects about himself, I'm just wondering what he might have thought of his own appearance and if it played any part in how others treated/viewed him?","Just finished Flowers for Algernon, which I found quite touching.

He has literally made use of the phrase ""the law and order always having its knee on the neck of black people"" on several occasions which makes me wonder how he would have reacted when it was recently demonstrated, literally and was no longer just a metaphor. The book gave me new insights into the life of an inmate and how he felt cheated by the very system that was responsible for protecting him. His affair with a married white woman being considered a bigger crime than stealing from people and his teacher in school telling him to be realistic when he voiced his ambition of becoming a lawyer, were such thought provoking points in the story, that proves the deeply entrenched nature of racism in people's minds.

books,"When people ask who my favorite author is, I always hesitate. Not because I'm ashamed or because I don't want to share, but because when I say, ""Tanith Lee,"" they look at me with the same blank expression a dog gives you when you pretend to throw a ball and they only partly fall for it.

My first exposure to Lee was in middle school. I was a lonely ten-year-old getting into YA fantasy, so anything related to magic or dragons was immediately on my to-read list. I would comb Scholastic magazines for books cheap enough that my mother could be convinced to write me a check. That's how I came across ""Black Unicorn"". It was a complete crap shoot: a little paperback maxing out at 188 pages, with a summary that read like most YA fantasy (sorceress has a daughter, daughter finds unicorn, daughter goes on adventure). I read that book in a day, then immediately wanted to read it again. And again. And again after I discovered the sequel--having not even realized there was such a thing--and again after finding the third installment to round out the trilogy.

Even to this day, the Unicorn series I still consider to be my favorite fantasy books of all time. Lee wrote in a beautifully poetic manner without turning to fluff. Her absurd and stark depiction of humanity was evident even before I was old enough to comprehend the depth in her characters and the social commentary she was making. Her heroine Tanaquil became like a friend to me. Her imagination was witty and vast, and she knew how to give the reader permission to read between her lines. She didn't spoon-feed, she didn't over-complicate, and she knew how to write a good ending.

I won't go into more details about Lee, but her life and her choice of themes is an interesting read (especially since she was illiterate until she was eight-years-old). Her YA works include some fun ones, like Piratica and The Claidi Journals. 

I have also read a large number of Lee's adult fantasy books and short stories--many of which are very dark and highly sexual in nature--so for anyone looking to expand their YA list for themselves or any young adults in their lives, I'd caution you accordingly. For someone less interested in YA, I'd suggest for a first taste ""Biting the Sun"" (a two-book collection of ""Don't Bite the Sun"" and ""Drinking Sapphire Wine"") as it is very provocative and manages to hit home on a lot of current issues despite its being written in the '70s.

Lee's work has been a true inspiration, not only for my own writing, but for my growth as a person, my understanding of human relationships, feminism, homosexuality and sexuality in general, and the power of imagination and world-building to prompt critical thinking about the world and its current state. 

But I will always love Tanaquil and her world of absurdity the most. And I hope this post intrigues someone else to seek out that little yellow paperback with the black horned horse on the cover, if only to enjoy a few hours of escapism and the beautiful simplicity of a well-told adventure.",Appreciation for a Lesser Known Trilogy (The Unicorn series by Tanith Lee),1594757361

books,"At 14 years old I read my last book. It was The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck and was required reading for 9th grade English. This was the last book I was required to read in that class following on from some fantastic books such as To Kill a Mockingbird and also some nightmares such as Great Expectations.

Required reading even for great books seemed to just drain the life out of me. Having to hit specific chapters for reading quizzes and blah blah blah it just sucks. After that I refused to read another book and would just read chapter summaries for the rest of my honors high school education and two college degrees (albeit not in English).

This is after a childhood of absolutely loving to read. I remember loving Harry Potter, Peter and the Starcatchers, the Lord of the Rings, and more. My wife absolutely loves to read and before COVID I would surprise her with random book store shopping sprees every so often. She's always told me she didn't want an e-reader due to liking to flesh out a bookshelf but I decided to buy her a Paperwhite anyways since we're avoiding going out.

Well flash forward to a few weeks ago after seeing the Kindle sit in its box unused I decided I would give it a shot because I'm a tech guy. I picked up the Hobbit and started by making myself read a chapter a night and it's turned in to me reading as much as I can before I get too tired. It's been fantastic. I've got The Lord of The Rings loaded up and ready to go next, and have picked up A Game of Thrones to try to read that next. 

So all that to say I'm super excited about reading again and if you fell out of reading as a kid give it a shot - it's super fun. Oh and if you're a fan of tech try out an e-reader.

Initial 16 novels have a slightly different feel, there is a kind of connectedness among characters, like they are good guys and kind of honor each other,  even though Westlake specifically mentions that the heisters are gonna leave each other behind if it comes to that. But the last 8 novels made me feel what Westlake has actually written about those characters. The disconnectedness among characters, the shrewdness, the fragility of life of characters.

books,"A while ago, I read **The Origin of Evil, by Ellery Queen**, and it was a complete failure of a novel. This was my first Queen but I went in understanding the reputation for the series as mainly puzzlebooks, which focus on the clever crime over any deep characterization. Not a problem. However --- color me cock-eyed when I saw that the book was hinting at an actual *noir atmosphere* --- and --- good gravy! --- psychological depth! Fascinating, troubled, hunching Angelinos with a dark boil festering under each one of them, all in different ways, and (most fascinating of all) a threat of spreading such rank odors into the heart of Ellery himself, our sleuth-protagonist. 
‎
‎‎
I was hooked. Apparently I'd come across something very, very good indeed, and quite surprising. I read on. Until I finished it.

‎‎
I did not feel well. It was all a ruse. The 1950 publication date shows, *hard*, in the novel's devastatingly smug, self-indulgent, boys-showing-you-their-toy-train-set second half. Was that the point? I guess it could've been. But the cardinal sin in any fiction is to make promises you either cannot keep, or cannot subvert with something more interesting.

‎‎
Apparently the two authors of this novel thought, ""look at our neat little cipher"" to be more interesting than exquisitely well-realized glances into the human heart, and probably many of their readers would agree. But not I. If I knew that that's all this book would have to offer from the start, the offense would not be so odious. I enjoy Agatha Christie for god's sake. But whether by accident or intention, a much better book was hinted at in the first hundred pages, then crushed by the weight of its own ego.

‎‎
To wit, Ellery finds himself attracted to a middle-aged married woman. She is an interesting character. Also, haunting and compelling is the pockmarks of bizarre lust that creep out of Ellery's mind whenever Delia, the wife, is about --- despite his aloof self-image. It's riveting. 

‎‎
But then, once he finds out that this woman, who he is tempted to bed on more than one occasion (it's refreshingly explicit) --- once he finds out that she is already sleeping with her husband's valet, *by her abusive husband's designs and consent* (long story) --- Ellery sees her ""for what she really is"" (paraphrasing, but only slightly). He turns away from her, both metaphorically and literally. (There is a real scene where this happens.) Now we know the truth, the book seems to say. She was a whore, all along. That bitch. The book, by direction, quietly concurs, and reduces her dialogue, presence, and feelings to almost nada (even though she's still in the room most of the time, and in fact plays a crucial role in the plot). *Now* we can focus on the good stuff, say the Queen authors rubbing their hands together grinning.

‎‎
What. Could this be a joke. Evidently not. The message seems to be somewhere along the lines of implying that Delia was a mere immoral distraction for our brilliant detective --- as opposed to a victim. Why would Ellery suddenly care that she's sleeping with someone whom her husband *wished* her to sleep with --- Queen already knew her to be ""claimed"" anyway. Is it because the evil husband is paralyzed from the waist down? So if nobody else is f*cking her, her affection must be genuine? Otherwise…

‎‎
Mind you, Ellery and this woman never date. They don’t commit to each other. Ellery and the novel are so offended at the idea that a woman could be expressing attraction toward a man while maintaining a sexual relationship with another one, that she’s thrown off the barge. And it gets worse. The book explicitly states that the husband has found this strapping valet to seduce Delia in order to dominate her in the one way he cannot. Thus the book shows a canny awareness of the fact that this is another aspect of the wife's victimhood. And yet... she is eclipsed as her punishment for these sins. “Sins”.

‎‎
This was not the only problem, just the worst. Other issues abound. Crowe, a fascinating proto-""prepper"" type who lives in a treehouse bracing for the end of the world entrances you with his pessimism, as well as his creepy predation upon Laurel, the plucky 19-year-old daughter of the murder victim who enlists Ellery in the first place (and who, I'll admit, even from the book's promising start never seemed particularly real). But what's with this Crowe guy, the prepper? Is he involved in the murder? What psychosexual madness is bubbling up between him and Laurel? 

‎‎
Just healthy flirting, it turns out. By story’s end Crowe does the good upstanding thing and marries Laurel before climbing down from his treehouse and --- attaboy! --- joining up to fight the Koreans and save the country. (In a jarring and unnecessary kowtow to current events, one chapter suddenly begins by informing you, in a true longuer, that this conflict is now happening and everyone is talking about it.) Crowe grows up and he marries, enlists, conforms. Oh joy. And his predation was just healthy overtures all along.

‎‎
Laurel, in a moment that is not properly justified given her character, dramatically shoots Delia in front of everybody but misses. (Laurel thinks she’s the killer.) It would've been avoided if Ellery would've just told her what the fuck was going on, but instead he lords the fact that he has The Solution, which he shan't reveal *just yet*, over this girl’s head, while she desperately clings to bringing justice to her dead father. But, he tells her nothing. (And yes, I've thought about it, he absolutely could’ve; especially since she was showing clear signs of doing something dangerous before she went ahead and did it. He just doesn't tell Laurel because... it's more fun? To make her wait?) Even after she shoots Delia he doesn’t tell her a single thing, not until his Big Performance in the country house whodunit style.

The ultimate problem is that *Evil* makes headway in mood and atmosphere while still being a good ripping bit of genre fun, *but then* knocks that all out of the way so every character can slip into what I call **PDMS** --- **P**lot **D**ependent **M**ood **D**isorder. Every player, by the story’s final portion, has no mood or demeanor outside of how the plot is developing, or how the mystery is bearing out. Nothing even a little separate. They have no personalities or emotions beyond that. That's okay if them's the brakes from the start (although it still isn't great), but to devolve into that is a real gut-punch. It blows. And it’s just such a sh*tty, contemptible way to write.

Sorry to go on so long about a book half a century old. I had strong feelings. And if any Queen fan who loves this novel would like to challenge my arguments, I'm eager to hear it. It’d be nice actually to look at the text from a different angle.

books,"I go to a bookstore mystery section and find an entire shelf dedicated to James Patterson. Stephen King basically rules the horror shelves. It's crazy. In fantasy/SciFi books about Middle Earth and Tolkien and series like Star Wars and Game of Thrones engulf a good chunk of the aisle (most of it is just merchandise).

books,"Hello everyone, good morning.

I consider myself a beginner reader. It's only recently that I started to believe in the benefits of reading and begun to read almost everyday..

My question is, is skimming a good reading skill to adopt?
Does it come naturally as you read more and more?
For me personally, I like to read each and every word to take in all the information and immerse myself into the content of the book.. Is it possible to immerse yourself into the book by skimming?

Thank you and have a good day.

P.S. I can't wait to be able to skim without an effort.",Question about skimming while reading.,1594735818
