datascience,"Hello everyone,

I am currently taking an introductory to data science open course ( [https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycs0007-mining-massive-data-sets](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycs0007-mining-massive-data-sets) )which goes over a variety of data science topics. I am really loving it and really want to learn more about the topic. The course is really theoretical so they don't really teach you how to use python or R to apply the concepts. I am currently on my fourth year on a computer science and mathematics degree. Therefore i do have a background on programming and probability plus the concepts that I learned on this course.

I was wondering if there is any course which teaches you how to use different python or R (preferably Python)  frameworks based on the theory that I already have. Or do you guys recommend me to just try to learn those frameworks by myself using documentation and practice?

At work, we ran into a problem back on February 19, 2020 where an aggregate column (series 1) was aggregating incorrectly due to some issues related to coding done by a third-party. Although that third-party is working on the solution, the solution will only apply from the date of implementation and can't make retroactive changes. 

What is the best approach to ""correct"" these numbers if all we have is historical data from prior to February 19 and another series of data that's aggregated by a partner company? Prior to February 19, our numbers were usually 30%-40% of the partner's numbers. 

The following link is a sample of the series 1(went wrong on February 19th) and series 2 (correct the entire time).

* 5+ years experience with SQL (or similar language aimed at querying relational databases)

* 5+ years of experience working with data visualization tools

* Proficiency with Excel (conditional formulas and formatting, charting, etc.)

* Proficiency manipulating large data sets through statistical software or other methods

**PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS**

* Advanced degree in Computer Science, Learning Sciences, Operations Research, Econometrics, Statistics or related technical field

* 2+ years of development experience in Python, R or similar scripting languages

datascience,"Hi, I have a general question about Bayesian inference which may help me solve a problem I have. It is best to illustrate this with an example. Inspired from this great post by AllenDowney:

[https://github.com/AllenDowney/BiteSizeBayes/blob/master/08\_soccer\_soln.ipynb](https://github.com/AllenDowney/BiteSizeBayes/blob/master/08_soccer_soln.ipynb)  


Let's say I want to get an estimate for the number of goals scored by a team in a football match.  
I model this as a Poisson process with parameter lambda.   
On lambda I put a Gamma distribution as the prior, with parameter alpha. Let's say I use a prior value of 1.4 for alpha.

In the blog post, we are computing the posterior **after** a match has been played. So, given a game where 4 goals were scored by a team, we compute the posterior for that team which is now shifted to the right. 

What would we do if we wanted to update the estimate in real-time? So instead of computing the posterior after the game has been played, we do this every 5 minutes until we hit 90 minutes. So I am interested in getting a posterior for 90 minutes given the data after 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, etc..  
I can think of two ways of doing this. Please help me understand what method, if any, makes sense:  


1. We propagate the data we have to the expected number of goals in 90 minutes after x minutes have passed. So, if after 30 minutes a team scored 1 time, we propagate that to (90/30)\*1=3 goals and use this as input to compute the posterior using the same process as in the blog post.  
**Issue:** I feel like this is not correct, because what if a team scores in the first 5 minutes? Doing this would mean we expect the team to score 18 (!) times in a match. The first posterior calculation after 5 minutes would be complete trash. Although this should eventually converge to a realistic value as we do more updates?
2. We don't use a value of 1.4 for alpha because that's based on a 90 minute match. Instead, we use alpha = 1.4 / (90/5) = 0.08 to scale it to a 5-minute prior. So, on average, a team scores 0.08 times every 5 minutes. We now do the posterior calculation every 5 minutes instead of every 90 minutes.  
**Issue:** I don't understand how we now get a prediction for the 90 minute posterior because the posterior we calculate every time will be based on 5 minutes. Also, how do we link the second posterior (for minutes 5-10) to the first (minutes 0-5)?   


Perhaps I am missing something basic here. I really want to understand Bayesian inference better but feel like I am not completely getting it. Thanks!","Real-time Bayesian updating, how to link posteriors?",1587316128

For some reasons that are not relevant to explain I moved from Spain to Houston, Tx back in April 2019. I had the opportunity to take the year off to study Data Analytics/Science since I have set the goal to change careers from marketing. 

I've enrolled on a Professional Certificate by the UT at Austin and I managed to learn quite a lot of Python, R, Data Wrangling and Visualization as well as modeling and algorithms. I then brushed up my skills on excel and learn how to use Tableau and Power BI.

When I finished all of this I started to send resumes and got to the final stages of the hiring process with two companies that logically paused the hiring because of the covid-19. 

I am now feeling that this hard times will be dragging for quite a lot of time and I am looking to keep improving my skills during this time to be stronger when applying for Data Analysts jobs. I quite like Data Science but I believe I should start by getting into Data Analyst's jobs first.

**The question** Suppose we run the SNOWBALL algorithm on the text below to attempt to extract the FOUNDER-OF relation. Which of the patterns below will extract at least one correct example of that relation without extracting any incorrect ones (select all that apply)

* Correct examples: (Microsoft, Bill Gates)(Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg)(Google, Larry Page)(Google, Sergey Brin)

**Source text**: Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates, produces both computer software and personal comput-ers. The founders ofGoogle, Larry Pageand Sergei Brin, developed an advanced search experience. And Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, crafted a new communication platform. And, usage exists between them: indeed, Bill Gates is a user of Google search,and Larry Page of Microsoft products such as Word. Bill Gates of Microsoft, Larry Pageand Sergei Brin of Google, and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook were all pioneers of today’s technology.

* You can assume that all of the patterns are well formed SNOWBALL patterns.
   * (a) ORG, founded by PERSON
   * (b) ORG, PERSON
   * (c) founders of ORG, PERSON
   * (d) PERSON of ORG

**My solution:**

    import nltk
    from nltk.tag import pos_tag
    import re
    
    pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(word_tokenize(src_text)) # POS tagging of the sentence
    ne = nltk.ne_chunk(pos_tags) # Named Entity Recognition 
    # ne.draw() 
    
    def test_patterns(ne, subj, obj, pattern, relsym): 
    for rel in nltk.sem.extract_rels(subj, obj, ne, corpus='ace', pattern=pattern): 
     print(nltk.sem.rtuple(rel)) 
        print(nltk.sem.clause(rel, relsym=relsym)) 
    
    # Pattern A, ""ORG, founded by PERSON"", returns ('microsoft', 'bill_gates'), which is correct test_patterns(ne, ""GPE"", ""PERSON"", re.compile(r'.*,.*founded.+by.+'), ""Pattern 1: "")

**Outputs:** Pattern 1: ('microsoft', 'bill\_gates')

&amp;#x200B;

    # Pattern B, ""ORG, PERSON"", returns ('google', 'larry_page'); ('microsoft', 'larry_page') which is incorrect test_patterns(ne, ""GPE"", ""PERSON"", re.compile(r'[^,]+'), ""Pattern 2: "") test_patterns(ne, ""ORGANIZATION"", ""PERSON"", re.compile(r','), ""Pattern 2: "")

**Outputs:** Pattern 2: ('microsoft', 'bill\_gates') Pattern 2: ('google', 'larry\_page') Pattern 2: ('google', 'mark\_zuckerberg') Pattern 2: ('microsoft', 'larry\_page')

&amp;#x200B;

    # Pattern C, ""founders of ORG, PERSON"", returns ('Google, Larry Page'), which is correct test_patterns(ne, ""GPE"", ""PERSON"", re.compile(r'[^,]+'), ""Pattern 3: "")

**Outputs:** Pattern 3: ('google', 'larry\_page')

&amp;#x200B;

    #Pattern D, ""PERSON of ORG"", returns (""Sergei Brin"", ""Google""); (""Larry Page"", ""Microoft""); (""Bill Gates"", Microsoft"") which is incorrect. test_patterns(ne, ""PERSON"", ""GPE"", re.compile(r'\bof\b'), ""Pattern 4: "") test_patterns(ne, ""PERSON"", ""ORGANIZATION"", re.compile(r'\bof\b'), ""Pattern 4: "")

**Output:** Pattern 4: ('sergei\_brin', 'google') Pattern 4: ('larry\_page', 'microsoft') Pattern 4: ('bill\_gates', 'microsoft')

&amp;#x200B;

**The correct solution:** I happen to know the correct solution, which is how I know my code is wrong.

The answer is (a) and (c).

* (a): correctly extracts (Microsoft, Bill Gates)
* (b): correctly extracts (Google, Larry Page) but also incorrectly extracts (Microsoft, LarryPage)
* (c): correctly extracts (Google, Larry Page)
* (d): correctly extracts (Microsoft, Bill Gates), (Sergei Brin, Google), (Mark Zuckerberg,Facebook), but also incorrectly extracts (Microsoft, Larry Page)

datascience,"I have a discrete probability distribution which I want to update as new evidence comes in. I thought about it in a Bayesian context, but I don't think that will work because I don't have any formulation of the likelihood. Perhaps I'm missing something.. Here's the problem statement:

Suppose I am running an online store, and people can order stuff online and choose a timeslot for it to be delivered.Assume I have three delivery timeslots \[6:00-8:00, 8:00-10:00, 10:00-12:00\]. My goal is to get a real-time estimate for the amount of orders I will receive at the end of the day for each slot.

More formally, let the three slots be denoted \[x1,x2,x3\]. I am interested in knowing the values of orders (y) in each of the slots \[y1,y2,y3\] at the end of the day. So predicting number of orders in each time slot.

I was thinking: if I assume an initial distribution (normalized) of orders \[p1, p2, p3\], I want to update this distribution over time as new orders are coming in. We here assume the total number of orders to remain constant. More practically:

1. I have initial probability distribution \[p1,p2,p3\] = \[0.4, 0.4, 0.2\] (based on domain knowledge, people tend to order less later in the day for some reason)
2. After 10 orders have come in, almost everyone ordered in the first time slot. y\_10 = \[9, 1, 0\]
3. I want to update my prior to reflect this. Perhaps it would be something like \[0.5, 0.4, 0.1\] based on the evidence that came in
4. Repeat throughout the day. Because I assume the total number of orders to be constant, this would give me a direct estimate of the orders \[y1,y2,y3\].

If I knew the likelihood function I could use some kind of discrete bayesian updating with prior distribution being \[p1,p2,p3\] and update as orders come in. The problem is I don't know the likelihood function. How could I achieve this?",Updating discrete probability distribution - Bayesian or something else?,1587213992

datascience,"Hi all, 

I am sure these variety of questions have been done to death, but I figured I would ask as I have a particularly specific situation. I am a biologist whose current work does not include dealing with large biological data sets, however, I am contemplating doing a doctorate in a field with a mix of wet and dry lab. In the meantime I would like to upskill whilst I am employed (and have a lot of time because of quarantine) with an eye towards getting some open bioinformatics projects under my belt. I am currently doing José Portilla's Python Bootcamp and would like some pointers from there. I don't mind paying for a course, albeit Udacity is probably a bit expensive for me, but given a sufficient recommendation I might be inclined to pay for it. My quantitative background from college is unfortunately limited to differential equations (including partial) and linear algebra, with no college level stats such as probability theory.

datascience,"I have an interview with a company in a couple of days for a Data Analytics/Mining/Visualization position. I am told that during the interview they would provide a random dataset and I am to use Python along with libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib on a Jupyter Notebook to provide them insights. I can even train an ML model to predict values if needed.  

Off the top of my head, I see myself providing them with statistics such as mean, median, and mode. Probably even perform k-means clustering and provide them the clusters.

Any suggestions on what else I can do with the dataset if I assume it would be labeled? (eg: provide actionable insights) What if it was unlabeled?
