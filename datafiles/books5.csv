books,"1. I got this collection of Beckett's Trilogy for a while now and tried to get through the first book, Molloy, a few times, but I always failed. This time something just clicked and I loved every page of this novel.         

2. Should I bother to explain the plot? Is there a point when the plot makes no sense? Having a rational plot is overrated. Almost every other foundational aspect of a novel is more interesting to me.  What I like in stories is a strong writing style, interesting characters and themes, and an evocative setting.     

3. Samuel Beckett is known as a minimalist, but at this stage of his career he was only paring down the plot of his story. I've never been a fan of minimalist prose styles, so I'm glad Beckett's language is very exuberant. I think the problem with my first attempts at getting into the book was that I read it too fast. Beckett is meant to be read slowly, with each sentence given great attention.       

4. The two narrators are rambling self-contradictory loonatics who are the two most fascinating narrators I've read in a while. Molloy has already lost his mind, but what remains of his obsessions is hilarious to listen to. Moran is in the process of losing his mind and is also hilarious. Most interpretations say these men are the same person but I dunno. It just sounds too easy.    

5. Later in his career, it seems like Beckett will get rid of his characters and his setting and will write stories based on a lone voice contemplating itself, or something like that. I don't know if I quite look forward to exploring that late stage of his career. I am confident that he can pull it off, but I don't know. Flipping though some at the library, it looks impossible to me. Will the other two novels in this trilogy ease me into it well? I can always work backward and check out Murphy, which people tell me is playfully Joycean in its style.

books,"I'm going to start with a little background about me - I love learning, but I always hated reading growing up. All of the books they made us read in school were of the kind that needed to be excessively picked apart to be understood. You would need to know what the author did on the afternoon of their 38th birthday in order to understand why they chose their main character to wear blue all the time. Similarly, why anyone would want to read something like Ulysses by James Joyce is beyond me. However, there were two books that I LOVED from school - Into the Wild by John Krakauer and The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien. What I loved about them was that they **just** told their story. There was no impossible to decipher prose or extremely niche literary references to Shakespeare - they were just poignant stories told to the point but with enough description to do the job and enough easier to understand references or metaphors/similes to make me laugh. I hope I do not sound like I am asking for ""stupid-proof"" books. I just can't stand when an author takes 5 pages to say something they could have said in a sentence - no matter how ""beautiful"" the description might be. 

Now, in my early twenties, I've had a ""reading"" reawakening because of Stephen King! I just finished The Stand, and have been going quickly through all of his books!

I think there is a part where the parents question why the child wants to name the puppy Dog and the child's reasoning was either because he was a dog or because there was no other dogs named dog. towards the end of the novel i think Dog gets together with many more dog to either have a party or do something, im not sure what that something is keep in mind i was in 4th grade at this time.

books,"Just reading 1984 for the first time (I know, late to The Party) and came across these passages

“Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare.
The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed.”

Further: 

“War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. But this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society. What is concerned here is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work, but the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly.”

It’s been making for a fascinating read in light of being an election year in the U.S. and reflecting on the past 4 years (Border walls, Betsy DeVos, Tensions in Iran, “Fake news”, bigotry and popularized nationalism, etc).

Chapter 16: The Myth of Sisyphus

January 20, 2020

The punishment of Sisyphus has long been an allegory to represent humanity's futile search for meaning and truth in a seemingly meaningless and indifferent universe. However, the vivid image of someone damned to endlessly repeat a monotonous task resonates as an allegory about the old-skool human condition. For the humans of old are condemned to live out lives repeating the same task again and again. For Sisyphus' punishment for his wicked life was to push a huge boulder up a hill, and when it reaches the top, it falls back down and he is required to push it up the hill again for all of eternity.

Throughout my work I have proved this conclusion wrong. However, the story does bear great significance in understanding the trap in life and learning how to overcome it. And the answer to the solution is to document your life spreading virtue. Because when you keep an account of your past, that past builds into something that no man can destroy and your toils to produce this work grows. I work really hard to provide you this content. And then that content stands as a virtual copy of me covering a particular aspect of our human condition. I only am required to say things once, however, I do often repeat myself for the benefit of my audience. But that work is frozen in time and it is viewable by every single Internet enabled person on this planet. As my work grows, so does my audience and the amount of views they receive. I can never lose views, even after my death. For the work of God is eternal: my death will not stop my work from continuing.

The nine to five life offers nothing but the mundane. To free yourself from the fate of Sisyphus one must free themselves from the monotony of the nine to fiverr. The only exception to this is if you find your dream job. But the truth is almost all jobs are slavery. It would be really difficult if not impossible to find a job in which you are doing exactly what you want to be doing in life. It is best to create your own investments and not help other people expand theirs. We live in a world driven by money. Use your money wisely and invest in the most virtuous causes. Create and grow your assets, for if you published them correctly then they can never be removed. Building your life is building your profile. Become prolific and you will never have to worry about rolling the boulder up that mountain again. Dig a hole at the top of the mountain so that when you push it up the mountain for the last time, it stays there. But don't celebrate yet, for we have many boulders to affix to the peaks. There are many issues that are worthwhile causes to invest yourself in. In fact, there are many boulders out there that need to be placed on the tops of summits. I can't be expected to place all of these boulders in my lifetime. I need your help to save the world. But you can be of no help to me until you are enlightened. It is the purpose of all of my work to guide you to enlightenment.

We live in a world with many types of economies and if you need to hire someone for a very affordable price, you can. Become an entrepreneur and hire people to assist in your own projects. If at all possible, avoid working for other people because humans on this earth do dirty business. There are ethical problems riddled all throughout our employment systems. Employees are generally treated as commodities and most professions receive little to no respect. Businesses will pay the minimum amount possible for the maximum work possible. They are not concerned about you and your well being. Why would you dedicate your life to a business that is exploiting you? Businesses succeed off exploiting people: it is in its code. I recommend not giving your life to an employer. Instead, give your life to God. Besides the monetary gain, all of the benefits of working for God are much better than working for the man. Even if you are homeless, the benefits of working for God far outweighs the benefits of slaving for the nine to five. You can only find out the benefits of working for God after giving your life to God and enduring hardship for it. The rewards for the virtuous life far outweighs the rewards of working a typical job your whole life.

Choose your television wisely because it will condition your mind. Be very careful about Hollywood and what they produce. What goes into you is what comes out of you. So make what goes into you the virtue in which you wish to reflect as in life. Television is best served for educational reasons. It is a much better idea to become a fan of a single content producer like me instead of forfeiting your psychology over to big businesses. There are a handful of television shows that I watch but they are only used to receive the type of education I want or to learn from the style of comedy I like. Everything in which you do in life should be viewed as an opportunity to learn. If you are not learning from the content in which you invest yourself in then you will become stale and this will directly result in depression. The reason why we enjoy entertainment in which the characters develop as people is because it is inbuilt in us to evolve as people. It takes a lot of training in front of the television to no longer care about your personal human evolution and instead rely on the evolution of fictional characters to satisfy that need. You need to develop as a person on a daily basis. If you do not do this then there is no potential in this life for you to be happy. I am always happy. I am never sad. Because I am enlightened. The only time one needs to be sad is if a loved one dies and that is only for a short period of mourning. Please take my words to heart and you too will become enlightened. I am trying to share this information to bring joy and happiness in your life. I am not writing this merely for the sake of writing this. My intentions are to help you see the world for how it truly is because everyone around me has been brainwashed by their televisions. Time to wake up.

What does it mean to give your life to God? I see people all the time, ""giving their life to God"" yet I don't see its results. How can you give your life to God and a nine to five job at the same time? In most cases, you can't. The mark of the beast is money and it will be placed in your right hand, seeing as most people on this world are right handed. Only few hold out their left hand to receive their income. Giving your life to God truly entails handing over your entire life. It is obvious to identify who has been and who has not been saved. For their worldly toils will tell you exactly who they have given their life to. And if those results do not reflect God, then this person has not given their life to God. This consists of most people who go to a church, temple, or mosque.

Apple has refused to publish, ""This Book Is a Game"" because of its content. This means that they will also refuse to publish this book. It is a surprise that they allowed me to publish my first three books but the messages on there were pretty cryptic. It is only recently that I have been so upfront about my intentions. When will other publishers find out about my content and then  take my books down? This world isn't fair. My digital game development is going extremely well but I am afraid that will be censored too. Because the game is basically a book delivery system. And I will not change its contents for any man. And this means that many people will object to its content. I don't think Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft will allow me to put my game on their system. But I will build it and see where I want to take it from there. I really want my game to be on all major platforms. The amount of times I get censored for my work makes me doubt that any console producer will accept my highly controversial game. All I can do is pray. Remember, Satan runs this world. Although you may get the opportunity to write books, make television, and make games, there is no guarantee that you will be allowed to showcase your work to the world. This is my version of Sisyphus. Not all outlets will accept your work. In fact, most will not. It is in cases as these where the boulder rolls back down the mountain. There is also no guarantee that a content publisher will keep your content because once they find out what it is they will be required to make an ethical decision. And that decision determines whether or not they enter the kingdom of heaven. So even if the boulder rolls back down the hill, those responsible will burn for eternity in Hell. For they are destroying the works of God. And God shall destroy all of those who destroy the works of God. God will destroy all those who prevent His works from seeing the light of day.

It is ironic how Apple refused to sell my book. Because Apple is the forbidden fruit. And I am literally going after the forbidden fruit. Businesses are really stupid for using symbolism that they understand not. They launch with a vision but many hands in the pot screws their original intentions. Employees in which do not share your vision and enthusiasm will actually hurt your business. To create a morally successful business one must have everybody on board with the direction of the company. One evil individual hired can speak on behalf of the entire company and ruin their future plans. One person who clicks deny represents that entire company hitting deny. When will businesses learn from their actions? Businesses that screw me over end up having that information reflected in my work. There are consequences for all of our actions. Apple refused to publish my book and that gets highlighted in this chapter. I am very worried about my game and who will publish it. I highly doubt that Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft will publish my game because of its content. That means I am most likely limited to PC only, which, if true, is really irritating because I really want this game on a portable device like a Nintendo Switch. But I will try all of them. And you will know what platforms allowed me on them by what platforms my game ends up on. I want my game on all platforms. If my game ends up only for PC, that means that no other publishers accepted it.

It says a lot about a publishing company that refuses to publish my work because of its content. My work is amazing and it reveals countless secrets of the world throughout. If a company refuses to publish these secrets, then they are willingly choosing to keep these secrets in the dark. It is really sad when a company loves publishing crap but refuses to publish real work when it appears. Most of the work on this planet is meaningless rubbish. Why are we so eager to publish useless information but very hesitant to publish real information?

Great amounts of my work is merely me discussing how my work is being censored. My life would have been so easy if my work was not constantly censored. Life for me is oftentimes like the fate of Sisyphus when companies all around me refuse to publish my work. I can't imagine my life without censorship. Most of my life is based upon censorship because I keep being censored everywhere I go. My work would not make sense without the censorship because the work is oftentimes censored. My work is here to show you how extreme our world's censorship is merely for writing articles about virtue. Virtue in this life is illegal and even the police will do everything that they can to prevent you from obtaining it. They will try their best to destroy your plans. Don't let them. They might take away our work through censorship but they can never take away our souls. But we can take theirs! The playing ground for angels and demons are even. They might have the brainwashed populace but we have their souls!

Just use your brain. Examine all of the pieces of media out there that prioritise virtue within its message. They almost do not exist. Virtue is not a priority whatsoever within modern society. And when pieces of information that promote virtue do arise, they are covered up. Virtue is censored in our modern day world. Because virtue is opposite to wickedness and we live in a wicked society. And to the wicked, virtue appears as wickedness. I publish my films, books, and games with every major publisher so if there is a publisher that does not have my content, that is because they refused it.

Everything should be allowed to be said. Nothing should remain unstated. This doesn't mean that everything should be allowed. Merely that everything should be allowed to be stated. What is justice? What would a world look like that was filled with justice? The problem is that we are not allowed to say whatever we want. I have proved this by being incarcerated many times merely for speaking the truth. If I am not allowed to say something, then why? It is because there is a mountain load of evidence to prove that what you believe isn't true. Our businesses are literally censoring the truth. They are literally censoring enlightenment. Why would they do that? Because they have an agenda in which they are not making public. Let me speak anything but only constrict what I do. Laws are important, but only when those laws have been created from virtue. How are we to create laws from virtue instead of human selfishness? We are to allow everyone to speak. And we are to constrict actions and not words. Because if we constrict the human heart then we will truly end up in the world of 1984. We live in a world full of idiots. And if you object to this point then you too are truly one of those idiots.

I recently got a Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas and I am absolutely loving it (I wasn't sure at first how I would take to reading electronic copies of books as I have always read physical copies).

I have read quite  a number of books so far, all of which I have purchased from the Amazon Kindle Store. However, I would like to be able to easily back up the files on my computer as I am aware when you buy ebooks from Amazon you do not technically 'own' the book and Amazon can hypothetically take your books off you any time they want.

Jack´s price is Millie and he doesn´t care about his wife and will get rid of her when he gets his price. So why did this calculating man take all that risk locking his wife up when he knew that he eventually, about a year out, would receive his price and then get rid of Grace.

In addition to this, while writing my essay ive noticed my terminology is horrible! i spoke to my english teacher and she told me to just read more books and yes, i do want to read novels since i miss the feeling of being attached to a book and wanting to expand my knowledge more but i don’t know where to begin.

"" Americans, we are told, are insensible to the wonders of inanimate nature, and they may be said not to perceive the mighty forests which surround them until they fall beneath the hatchet. Their eyes are fixed upon another sight: the American people views its own march across these wilds—drying swamps, turning the course of rivers, peopling solitudes, and subduing nature. This magnificent image of themselves does not meet the gaze of the Americans … only; it may be said to haunt every one of them in his least as well as in his most important actions, and to be always flitting

before his mind. Nothing conceivable is so petty, so insipid, so crowded with paltry interests, in one word so anti-poetic, as the life of a man in the United States.

**The question**

I'm interested in understanding king Charles IX's motives for ordering a hit on admiral Coligny.

***

**The king orders a hit on Coligny**

Firstly it is important for me to establish the fact that king Charles IX orders a hit on Coligny, since during a former attempt to discuss this matter two individuals who claimed to have read the book denied this fact.

In chapter 3 the following conversation between the king and Coligny takes place (the king is the first to speak):

&gt; ""I wish to put you at the head of everything. So listen: I must now go and reply to a new madrigal my dear and illustrious poet has sent me. I cannot, therefore, give you the documents necessary to make you acquainted with the question now debating between Philip II. and myself. There is, besides, a plan of the campaign drawn up by my ministers. I will find it all for you, and give it to you to-morrow.""  
&gt; ""At what time, sire?""  
&gt; ""At ten o'clock; and if by chance I am busy making verses, or in my cabinet writing, well—you will come in just the same, and take all the papers which you will find on the table in this red portfolio. The color is remarkable, and you cannot mistake it.""

Later in the same chapter the following conversation takes place between the king and the assassin Marauvel:

&gt; ""And who is this enemy, sire?"" asked the assassin.  
&gt; ""How should I know,"" replied Charles, withering the wretch with his contemptuous look.  
&gt; ""I must ask M. de Guise, then,"" faltered Maurevel.  
&gt; The King shrugged his shoulders.  
&gt; ""Do not ask,"" said he; ""for M. de Guise will not answer. Do people generally answer such questions? Those that do not wish to be hanged must guess them.""  
&gt; ""But how shall I know him?""  
&gt; ""I tell you he passes the Canon's house every morning at ten o'clock.""  
&gt; ""But many pass that house. Would your Majesty deign to give me any certain sign?""  
&gt; ""Oh, that is easy enough; to-morrow, for example, he will carry a red morocco portfolio under his arm.""  
&gt; ""That is sufficient, sire.""

***

**Two reasons why the hit doesn't make sense**

I find it difficult to wrap my mind around the king's decision to order a hit on Coligny for two reasons.

[1] The king is close to Coligny and values his opinion highly, as pointed out in chapter 1:

&gt; the King now swore by him, called him his father, and declared openly that he should in future confide the conduct of the war to him alone.

[2] The king is contemplating an imminent war, as pointed out by Henry of Navarre (aka ""the Béarnais"") in chapter 3:

&gt; ""Sire,"" returned the Béarnais, ""a war with Flanders is spoken of, and I am collecting round me all those gentlemen of my country and its neighborhood whom I think can be useful to your Majesty.""
