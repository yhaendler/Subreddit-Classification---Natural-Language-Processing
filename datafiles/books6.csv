Lovecraft never outright establishes a relationship between the great oldones and the outer gods. He mentions in Dunwich horror that Cthulu is the ""cousin"" to invisible entities called the ""old ones"" that are using Yog-Sothoth to break through, but thats a relationship between species rather than a family tree...you know how people say the cousin of the house cat is the lion or tiger....do you draw a family tree around cats and lions then??!

1. You cheapen the mystery and the great old ones qualities such as family.
2. Authors like Derleth and Carter watered down the mythos by doing this. Stripping it down of all the horror and rendering this into a B rated scifi...this is another reason why I never read anything outside the source. It takes away from Lovecrafts vision.

books," Evocation and nostalgia are the bases over which Mr Bradbury builds his monument to an inextricable trinity of time, place and people; evocation for the setting, sounds and scents of summer is effortlessly accomplished in light of Bradbury's masterful command of the sensual. His descriptions are luscious and vibrant, with a sense not just for lyricism in the prose and care for the aesthetic that lends sublimity and gentle beauty but also embedded in his writing is always an appeal to the emotional that, while sentimental in nature, is never trite or overbearing and instead showing more of an innate sensibility to the affairs around us instead of just being thoughtless romanticism.

There's also the nostalgia: for sights we won't see anymore, places we'll never return to, laughter that we won't hear again; but those glimpses of sadness Bradbury hides in his work point towards the ultimate creator of sadness in man itself, the inevitability of change or better said man's inability to cope with the reality of change. Dandelion Wine apart from being a breath taking portrait of summer distilled is also to an extent a musing on what it's like to grow up and lift the veil of reality for the first time only to encounter the ceaseless barrage of time and the randomness of circumstance as they crash against all we hold dear. It is to Bradbury's merit that this is never done in an apathetic or pessimistic tone but instead Dandelion Wine's speaks to us in a tranquil way, in an attitude of reconciliation between the inexorable change of things and our lives, suggesting awareness and satisfaction in the present, savoring the luxuries and little details of life hidden in every moment.

Bradbury doesn't shy away from depicting the darker aspects of the experience of getting to know life as it truly is: the uncertainty, the anxieties, the melancholy or the fear. And when he decides to take us to dark places to witness the ugliness outside but also inside ourselves we can only be too thankful he doesn't choose to linger there with us for long, for he is an effective writer and is just as capable of gifting us with paradise like images of childhood bliss or with the suffocating blackness of true despair.

The characters are likeable and if not always profound quite often very amiable and pleasant, people that cares for each other and in turn makes you care for them. A high point is Bradbury's perfect execution of similes and allegories, crafting sentences that become even more vivid and beautiful thanks to the comparison and quite often surprising you with the potency of their meaning which seems to come out of nowhere as Bradbury pens striking turns of phrase when one least expects it.

As said before the tone of this book is not a dark one, it's joyful, funny, witty, and almost all that brings to mind images of bright colors, nature and happiness.",Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury - Review,1579905478

books,"Alright, everyone. Before you downvote me into oblivion because I'm not posting about your UwU 1984 or Sanderson, let me say something here.

I love reading. I always have, and it was impossible not to - my house was almost a library. And I love cats. I have had over a dozen cats in my lifetime. So, naturally, when I saw Warrior Cats by Erin Hunter in the library, I picked it up. I remember vividly the moment I saw it, the moment I started reading, and when I finally finished. It had been an experience. I was enthralled by the life of these cats - living in a community, caring for each other, battling for their lives. It hit 5th grade me quite hard.

These books shaped what I am today. Without warrior cats, I wouldn't speak English; not in the level I speak today, anyway. Without warrior cats, I wouldn't draw. Without warrior cats, I wouldn't have friends to talk to thru lunch, be it on discord, or tumblr, or even at school.

These books are somewhat the best thing that happened to me, in the long run. But they fucking suck.

The plots are overused. The ""forbidden romance"" is way too common. The spark and originality the series once had was lost long ago, between the 6th and the 80th book.

Oh, I'm sorry. I should have mentioned. This series has over 80 books.

Ginger protagonist after ginger protagonist, the series kept dragging on and on. With an audience of either old readers, that started from the 1st book 17 years ago, or new ones, there have always been fans to keep the books and merch coming. Fan creators on YouTube, risen from the ms paint and window movie makers amv, now getting professional animation and art jobs because of their passion for a book series about cats.

But as much as the series inspires people to develop their artistic skills... it also hinders them. It hinders their creativity. It hinders their ability to create, or their freedom to do it. What went wrong?

In the beggining, the series had 4 arcs, and a few Super Editions, that were longer than the usual books, to tell stories that didn't fit. Many agree that already in the fourth series, it started to go wrong. The Erins were not in control of the story anymore - it was the editors. It was a fan, crazy for traditionalism, that shut down creativity and logic and replaced it with her own opinion only. It was the moment the series spiraled out of control from the author's hand. Warrior cats has, unfortunate, fallen victim to the grasps of capitalism.

There is hope with this new arc. The antagonist seems extremely threatening and the POVs from different protagonists really emphasize how little we know about the villain, and how manipulative he can be. But after the fiasco with the last arc, maybe we shouldn't stay hopeful after all.

books,"I was shocked to find out how religious Dostoevsky was. The way I see the world, and the way I interpret my actions and the actions of others, comes alive as I read his writing. It's as if they're a translation of my own thoughts that I am unable to put into words. They make me feel understood and like I am part of a mutual connectivity that spans decades and miles. The issue I have is that I am an Atheist. Before you jump down my throat, I'm not saying people who fall on any point of the religious spectrum shouldn't be able to enjoy Dostoevsky, but his writing highlights a very secular view of the world.

That brings me to my next point: I don't want to offend anyone, but I view religion as one of humanities biggest threats. I am interested in and confused by people who lean on religion to answer all of life's problems, instead of admiring the beauty and chaos of life for what it really is. For me, reading Dostoevsky makes me feel like I'm not alone in struggling with the duality of human nature and the absurdity of existence, and the helpless feeling that can come with it, without needing the pacifier that is religion. With that being said, I assumed he was just really good at getting into the mind of the ""other side"". He is a master at depicting individuals on opposite ends of the spectrum (thinking Ivan vs. Alyosha).

Obviously, my interpretation of his words is subjective, but he is ambiguous time and again- for example, the quote ""Without God, all things are permitted"". That is a very left phrase in my opinion, but it obviously can swing the other way. Idk, the way he saw the world and interpreted what he saw are not ramblings of someone who uses religion to cope with or understand human suffering and triumph. He simply thought too much to accept that cop out, because a cop out is truly what it feels like. 

Again, sorry if I offended anyone, but it doesn't add up to me. Also sorry if it's widely understood that he wasn't actually religious and I just came late to the party. I guess what I'm wondering is: Could his religious leaning be a product of the time he lived in? Was it uncommon (or dangerous) for Russians to identify as non-religious at the time? He didn't seem to be too afraid of authority or standing up for what he believed in.",Dostoevsky and religion,1579901379

books,"Recently, I read a post of someone writing about the importance of the book *A Man's Search for Meaning *. I figured I'd check it out of the library, but they didn't have a hard copy in the library network, only an audiobook. I had never listened to an audiobook; this format has just never been on my radar. I'm also one of those people who joined the e-reader game really late because ""nothing beats a paper book"". Don't get me wrong, I still feel that spark of joy with a paper book, but not **EVERY** read has to be on paper. I read way more now that I've started using an e-reader. So, I figured I'd give audiobooks a shot. Maybe I'd have a similar experience as with my e-reader.

Sure enough, I'm a fan. But it's not just that audiobooks are another point of access to literature or a format that may make it easier to ingest more text; it's because of the voice of the narrator. It's a whole new type of media for me, like a hybrid of a book and a podcast.

*A Man's Search for Meaning* is an important read but it is not a light one. Frankl recounts many sad stories from his experience at concentration camps, and reading pages on these experiences would normally cause me to put down the book, staring off in pensiveness. This causes me to read a book relatively slowly, and not in a ""I'm savoring it"" kind of way. 

So my argument in favor of audiobooks is: much like a conversation, you are forced to stay alert and engaged with the content. And much like a conversation, the narrator can offer some reprieve by changing tone going into the next paragraph, using a brief pause for weight and then an up-lifting intonation to help to carry on.

For one other argument based on my experience, the auditory format also helps in digesting complex information held in long sentences. When I read technically-dense information, I often have to read a sentence 2-3 times, maybe more if it's one of those forsaken sentences that take up nearly the entire paragraph. If speaking this same sentence, a good narrator can put emphasis and breaths in the right places. Yes, I know this is what commas can do, but hearing is sometimes better.

I guess I think about how humans were first a species who perfected passing information down through spoken word. I love text. It's efficient or sometimes just plain-preferred. But there is something about audiobooks that plays to an instinct on which reading does not.

Of course, I understand this is all contingent on the quality of the narrator.

What are other's experience with audiobooks? Was there a specific book you listened to that put you on an audiobook craze? Or will you just never be an audiobook person?

This post isn't bashing that at all, quite the opposite actually. I'd been putting off visiting my local one for a while but had always been envious of everyone here who describe all the facilities and benefits of modern libraries. 

I'm 23 and last year I started my journey to want to get back into reading. I only managed to read 4, but that was 4 more than the previous year so I took it as progress. But 2020 was gonna be a new year and I seriously wanted to at least hit a book a month, so today I set off to my local library. I hadn't been there in years but associated it with a lot of fun memories, like trips there as a kid with my siblings and later studying there as a secondary school student with all my friends. I was ready to go back and register a new library card (and potentially pay off whatever debt that'd remained) and determined to leave with a physical book in hand. 

Things were immediately off to not a great start as I approached the entrance to the library to already see it'd at least been reduced to half its size. That was upsetting of course, but you know at least it was still there, and its smaller interior showed off that the library was full. 

I went straight up to the front desk to register a library card but man, the dude could not have been any less inviting. Of course I definitely wasn't expecting any sort of congratulations or small talk or anything, but I also wasn't expecting to be made to feel like I was a nuisance. I'm English and this is London so I wasn't even expecting a greeting, but to be made to feel like I was an inconvenience somehow for wanting to register a card, and having to put up with huffing and just overall a generally unpleasant and cold interaction was a little surprising. But again I was there to further my progress and leave with a book. 

I referenced great threads ([like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/auacut/goodreads_lists_for_reddits_top_books_threads/)) that I found on this sub to help with selection, built a goodsreads account to keep track of my finds and then finally booted up my libraries catalogue to check for availability.  Now I know I've already mentioned a couple reasons above - but this was the real reason why I made this post. Not a single book I searched for was available. Not even ""its currently checked out right now"", but straight up it just wasn't available. It felt like such a rude awakening to remember thinking as a kid that the local libraries shelves almost went on forever, only to now be frustrated at its pretty woeful selection.

I own a kindle so my reading journey isn't hopeless, but I have been struggling with my retention for what I read, and was curious to see if holding a physical book would help at all. I also just wanna add here that none of the books I were looking for were obscure or too recent to have in stock. Literally just general stuff like 'The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy' or 'Meditations' weren't available. 

But yeah it hasn't been the outing I was hoping for. I do feel a bit demoralised at what my local library has become, but going through those threads did give me a lot to think about, and plenty of suggestions to get through. I do enjoy my kindle so it will probably stay my primary method of reading, and I might beginning taking notes while I read for the things I really don't want to forget. 

But I will also keep searching through my local catalogue or simply browsing the shelves for something I do want to read so this new pretty library card can be put to some use.

A practical questions so this whole post isn't completely just me complaining: 

- For people who do keep notes while reading, what kind of system do you use? Do you simply jot down favourite quotes or do you summarise how certain passages make you feel? I'm curious and would be grateful to know of any and all methods

- Also in general, for anyone who also finds it hard to retain what you read (both during a read and after you've read), what are some good tips to combat this?

books,"*Warning, this is a long and meandering post so if subjective monologue's bore you, scroll to the bottom for some questions I'm curious about :) 

 I was not an avid reader growing up. In fact, I had a middle school teacher who was always on me about my lack of reading. This was in the early 2000s and AR (Accelerated Reader) was the required testing mechanism for reading comprehension. Nothing about reading appealed to me at that point in my life. I didn't have the attention span for it and only wanted to be outside running around. It was not until college, I became more interested in books. I think Vonnegut's 'Cat Cradle' singlehandedly got me on the right path. Though throughout my college years I was still only reading a couple books a year, not including academic works I was required to read for my major. As I progressed more in my anthropology degree I began to become more interested in story telling and ethnography. I loved Zora Neale Hurston's 'Mules and Men' Richard Wright's 'Black Boy'. I started to understand the power of storytelling through real life experiences. Later in college I took a creative writing class and was introduced to Stuart Dybek who's short stories I still cherish to this day. But it was still hard for me to find the time or mental energy to sit down and read a book. On a road trip just after finishing college, I found a book on tape of 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' by Robert Pirsig and was honestly blown away not so much by the book but from discovering the form of audiobook. Since then, my main mode of biblio consumption is through listening. There are some books I still prefer reading: Maya Angelou, Patti Smith, Faulkner. But for a majority, I prefer audiobook. First because I can listen to them while I work and second, I still have trouble focusing when physically reading so it helps to avoid that. 
Okay that^ was all to explain how I finally became into reading. Now to my post's query ""why do you read?"" I've been thinking about this recently because due to a new job in the past half year I have been listening to A LOT of audiobooks. Like 50 in 6 months. It's getting to the point where I've started to forget some of the books I listened to just last month. I can recall plots and basics but I fear I miss out on eloquent quotes, small details that might hold meaning, etc. It's started to make me wonder why do I read at all, well at least in the magnitude I'm doing it now. I do enjoy the stories, it's a good way to pass time at work while still consuming some form of art, and I've told myself ""you probably wouldn't have read these anyway so at least you're getting something out of it"". Maybe it's about hearing the story and taking it in at the moment and assuming parts of the story, characters, plot, etc. will stick or become part of your ethos in some small way? I do believe reading and consuming other's stories and perspectives make you a better person so I'm hoping more is happening to me than meets the eye.

I also love the way he builds his characters as well, especially the two main characters. Like he never describes the two main characters directly. All the impressions about these two characters that the readers get are the impressions of multiple characters surrounding them, which creates a mysterious air of the novel.

The book club members all have English as a second language but they're at a high level. Currently I'm choosing the next novel for us to read together, and I wondered if anybody had any suggestions of books they think will be suitable? 

My goal is to find a novel that is interesting for a variety of ages (the club has a mixture of ages), the language isn't too difficult or obscure (their English is at a high level but often slang and specific cultural references cause them difficulty) and is popular or semi popular (so the club can easily get hold of copies). 

Previously we've studied a variety of stuff, they particularly enjoyed Jane Austen (although the older language was a slight barrier), Orwell, Ishiguro, Salinger and Harper Lee.

books,"I want my cake and eat it too? I have recently purchased a used book in rather good condition and like having it so. My question is do I mark up, dog ear, underline etc? My life's ambition is learning and so never read much fiction. I like to mark what I consider important sentences or points to be able to locate them later if need be. Now the truth of the matter is, I rarely actually do go back looking for a point I read  or have forgotten, but when I do and didn't mark the section it is extremely frustrating to me. So basically, is a book a tool for learning or an objet d'art to be kept in its as found new or used condition without further harm? I'm also an antique collector and would never consider modifying a piece in any way lest I make it worse. The distinction being that I don't have to do anything to an antique chair to sit on it, but a book quotation or important passage may be lost to me if I don't mark its location? Also I'm not speaking of first editions here, I do own some and of course do not mark them in any way, but they seem less readable to me?

I read Lolita about a year ago and it is one of my favorite novels so far. When I found out that Nabokov wrote a short Lolita-like story years before he wrote Lolita, I had to read it. And it disturbs me. 
Anyone who experienced reading Lolita probably felt a bit divided between disgust and compassion for Humbert Humbert. Well, I do. 
Now with the enchanter I feel so different. I didn't feel any compassion for Arthur, the protagonist, at any time. Reading this novel left me in pure disgust and I am so disturbed about the ending. Still I wouldn't want to miss it. Nabokovs writing style is one of a kind, I didn't find any other author whose writing can be compared to his yet. Every page is a masterpiece and I simply love what I read from him so far.
