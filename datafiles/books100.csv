Sure, my creativity, writing skills, etc seems to be quite above my peers in AP English, but I want to be a lawyer, not a fulll-time author.

anyways so through reading books i discovered that literature analysis was a thing (this brought back memories of learning it in hs but i was a horrible student and never payed attention in school) from watching youtube videos ab what ive read, and it just fascinated me how you could truly appreciate an author's work from analyzing it and so i tried doing so myself and came to a realization that i was very bad at it.

books,"Whenever I see advice on how to get more reading done, one of the main tips is ""read books you actually enjoy and don't force yourself to read books you don't like."" While I agree that this is sensible advice if you want to love reading, I also think that there is something to be said for going out of your comfort zone in reading. It bothers me when popular media demonizes this idea, like you're doing something wrong by working hard to read a difficult classic or a new genre that you don't particularly enjoy. Don't get me wrong, I think that leisure reading should be enjoyable, but I also think it's very limiting to only read books that fascinate you from the start.

books,"Hi idek where to start. I know some people (though they won't say nothing) will get annoyed by this post but tbh I felt like it needed to be shared. 

Growing up, I've noticed I've (a black woman) never really had any role models in the entertainment industry (idk if books are included in that but I'm assuming they are). There weren't any black...anything in what I saw. There were a few shows and movies I've seen with black characters but they were all on BET and TV One (channels for black entertainment basically) Outside of those, nothing. These past two years I've been more...inclined? curious? I don't what the right word for it would be. Basically, I had these urges to read more books about people who looked like me. I've recently came across a few pieces that I thought more people (specifically poc but anyone can read them) would like to read. I'll add a short description without spoiling anything (or I'll try not to)

Everything, Everything (Romance, YA)

This is more of a romance novel. It has nothing to do with race but the protagonist is a black girl. It's about a rare girl with this autoimmune disease that literally makes her homebound. Everything she receives is sanitized and brand new. She never really had a huge problem with it before (I mean ofc she wanted to leave every now and then but it wasn't like a huge urge) until she turned 17 and a cute boy moved in next door. I'm not gon say nothing else on it bc I'll def spoil it lmao but it's perfect for those hopeless romantics out there.

The Hate U Give (Realistic Fiction, YA)

First things first, the title. The title is based on Tupac's ""THUG LIFE"". The word is an acronym meaning ""The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody"". Race is a heavy topic in the book. It's about a girl from the ""hood"" going to a prestigious (and predominantly white) school realizing the racial injustices and microaggression around her when her childhood best friend is wrongfully killed by a police officer. For the people who want to understand how it is for us, this book might help a bit. Of course not all of our best friends are killed by cops but I mean you get what I mean.

Dear Martin (Realistic Fiction, YA)

(It's set in like the mid-late 2010's I wanna say) After a wrongful arrest, Justyce finds himself dealing with a shit ton of racial issues. He takes refuge in sending letters to the departed MLK. Justyce is also a ""hood"" kid going to a prestigious, predominantly white school. 

Dear Justyce (Dear Martin sequel)

Quan was a childhood friend of Justyce's before going on two completely different paths. After Quan is arrested for a crime he didn't commit, he enlists Justyce's help in getting out. Quan is briefly mentioned in Dear Justyce. 

Things Fall Apart (Historical fiction)

This is an African lit book that follows the story of a man before colonization hit his tribe and while it was happening. Colonizers tried to justify what they were doing by making the Africans seem like complete savages, so Chinua Achebe (the author) decided he wanted their (the Africans) side of the story heard as well. 

Tribal Scars (non-fiction?)

Tribal Scars is (or was) an African tradition. This story is about it's origins and why it was so important. 

The Darkness Rising trilogy (Fantasy, YA)

(copy and pasted summary) 

""Sixteen-year-old Maya is just an ordinary teen in an ordinary town. Sure, she doesn‚Äôt know much about her background ‚Äì the only thing she really has to cling to is an odd paw-print birthmark on her hip ‚Äì but she never really put much thought into who her parents were or how she ended up with her adopted parents in this tiny medical-research community on Vancouver Island.  
*Until now.*  
Strange things have been happening in this claustrophobic town ‚Äì from the mountain lions that have been approaching Maya to her best friend‚Äôs hidden talent for ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù out people and situations, to the sexy new bad boy who makes Maya feel‚Ä¶.different. Combine that with a few unexplained deaths and a mystery involving Maya‚Äôs biological parents and it‚Äôs easy to suspect that this town might have more than its share of skeletons in its closet.""

It isn't race related (it is a bit) But the main character is Native American

books,"I‚Äôm pretty sure the sensible answer to this is ‚Äúwell, grab another one!‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt anyone else ever feel that tugging guilt when you see the book you‚Äôve abandoned peeking at you? And it gets worse when you‚Äôre reminded that oh, ‚ÄúI was actually halfway through already?‚Äù

Personally, I‚Äôm reading The Vanishing Half which is honestly good as a book as far as writing style, character development and plot progression are concerned, but the story itself predisposes it to a rather poignant style that I find isn‚Äôt so uplifting/enjoyable when one is in a down mood herself.

books,"Hey everyone! Gotten mixed answers to this question from my friends so I thought I'd ask here. So, I found a poster on Amazon that shows 100 ""Classic"" books and you scratch off the ones you've read and I thought I'd put myself up to the challenge to complete them all. A handful I've already read but the majority I haven't. 

The question is about some of the books on the poster. There are a lot of straight-forward ones (read Ulysses, scratch off Ulysses), but a couple are throwing me off. For example, on the poster one of the scratch off squares says ""Game of Thrones"" another says ""Lord of the Rings"". The question is, should I have to read the WHOLE series of something before crossing it off? 

I don't necessarily have a problem with doing that, it's just if I end up disliking a book, I can always tough out a few hundred more pages and finish it. However, I'm really not into the idea of finding out I dislike Game of Thrones on book one and having to read five or six more. There is also a time issue, I would like to finish this poster in maybe a year or year and a half? But if I add a lot of extra books it'll make it so much longer. 

On the other hand, scratching it off after having only read one 100% feels like cheating. I also worry I'll tell someone I did this (show them the poster) and the assumption will be that I've read ALL of Game of Thrones/Lord of the Rings.

Oh, and there's a scene near the end where he asks her if she likes him, but she responds with something along the lines of 'you're my person'.

books,"I'm not confident that this is what Robert Louis Stevenson intended, but I do think it's weird how little anyone wonders about it. My theory is that Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde are two entirely separate people. They aren't split personalities, nor two souls sharing the same body, just two separate entities. First of all, the transformation between Jekyll and Hyde is never actually seen, only described. Utterson, whom the story is told from the perspective of, never sees it happening. The only time the transformation is mentioned is in Dr. Jekyll's and Dr. Lanyon's confessions. When Utterson finds that Edward  Hyde it's the only name on Dr. Jekyll's will, the initial suspicion is that Hyde was a horrible manipulator, and maybe he's just that. Maybe the whole narrative of split personalities is nothing but an elaborate plot to save his hyde (pun intended) that he pulled Dr. Jekyll and Dr. Lanyon into.

While this book did come out in 2014, I did start it, but I just finished it within a few days' worth of reading over the last few weeks. 

Some Pros: Getting Nico's point of view was awesome since everything that's happened to him since book 3. Maybe him and Will had some chemistry? Jason's development was cool to see, especially the ""bromance"" he had with Percy. The buildup I thought was really good, ending with the battle of the giants when the demigods were fighting the giants with their Gods. It was action-packed, fun to read; gave me goosebumps when they were all working together. Heck, even the Fates were there! That was cool. Probably the best part of the book IMO. 

Some Cons: No Percy!! Ugh. I know this isn't all about him (HEROES of Olympus), but at least one chapter of him would have been better. Whenever we did get his dialogue, it was fun, ""I'm a Leo..."" Gaea's battle = anticlimactic. Just several pages of that fight? The main villain the entire series has been building up to, and that's it? I was disappointed. Leo. I feel like him riding off into the sunset with Calypso and Festus was a little corny, but whatever. Part of me is glad he lived, but the other part of me would have been fine if he had died. When Jason and Piper were reminiscing about him, that would have been a cool ending/memory of him. 

Overall, it was a fun read, went through plenty of emotions, but I wanted more with Gaea. And Percy. Anyway, thanks for reading! What did you think?","Heroes of Olympus, Book 5",1621015278
books,"I heard about this book from peoples, movies and read articles that made a passing reference to this book. These repetitious references perked me up and I had to pick up this book to find out the hype behind this book. 

The only thing I knew before I picked up it up is that it involved children.  At first I was not really impressed because the characters were still exploring the world and I lacked the imagination to visualise it to really appreciate the work done. I had in mind many approaches the story could possibly take but none foresaw what actually happened which even after a part of the ending was spoiled for me when I tried to access the map of the island through the web and it turned out to be annotated with crucial plot points, it still doesn't compromised the surge of emotions that I felt as I read through and through and had me zoned out. Also, I find myself quite invested in characters throughout the book because they were so different and had very different priorities. More often than not I find myself a bit frustrated at the behaviour of certain characters that is however not atypical of their age group. It was quite thought-provoking too and can shift your perspective on what children are capable of. It nicely depicted the struggle of good over evil in a quite realistic manner.

I had a bunch of questions after the ending of the book, and even more after doing some Googling,

1. The book read as if it was written about an autistic character; however, the author came out and explicitly said that Eleanor is not autistic. This was curious to me and there didn't seem to be too much explanation otherwise why she didn't always pick up social rules.
2. I thought her and Raymond were heading towards a romantic relationship at the end (holding hands, kiss on the cheek, etc.) but a lot of analyses presented them as a platonic friendship. Is this meant to be unclear maybe?
3. That twist at the end was super jarring! I would have loved it to end with her learning to set that healthy boundary with Mummy and moving on with her life. I almost felt like it needed more explanation than being thrown in at the end, it seemed to change things a lot.

books,"I just finished listening to the dark matter audiobook and want to rant about its problems. 


SPOILERS


I preface this by saying that I am a sci-fi fan which probably explains a lot about what I felt.

I will start with what was good.. It was a good romance story (to me who doesn't read any romance), the story flowed well and interesting events push the plot forward.

Now to start with the rant...

1. Jason took forever to figure out that he was in another world. I have to try hard to justify it by saying he was in shock from the abduction and the changes, but it was just a very very unsatisfying read knowing that he is in another world

2. Jason ran from the only people that seem to know what's going on. All he saw was a gun and he was like, I NEED to get out of here. I can justify this by saying he thought these are the same people that abducted him, but after finding out that he has no brain tumor, the obvious solution is to go back and get information instead of wandering to find Daniela. 

3. This one I can't even justify. He and Amanda head into the world of the snow. She said that she can't stay in the box any longer and they both just TAKE OFF into the snow and almost die?! Even if it didn't feel too cold at first, the number one rule should be to MAKE SURE they always have fast access to the box in case they need to escape. And they just fucking leave it behind.

4. This is the worst WORST one. They arrive in the pandemic world, the moment they hear there's a pandemic, they should just get the fuck out. BUT HE KEEPS DRIVING ALL THE WAY TO THE HOUSE TO SEE HER. WHAT. That is NOT his Daniela, he will either be shot by the military, catch the virus, killing himself, killing Amanda, killing the occupants of whatever world he goes to, and if he makes it back to his own world, killing his Daniela. This makes absolutely zero sense, he is SUPPOSED TO BE LOGICAL, he even say so himself but he has no sense of reason throughout this entire ordeal. If he loves Daniela so much he should be leaving to find her instead of putting himself and her in danger.

Both of these felt like the author creating stakes where there isn't by making the character do something stupid, and I'm sure there are better ways to do this without having him make these stupid decisions which is why this is so frustrating. (I think this is meant to show how much he loves his wife and he's going through a pandemic just to see her, but to me it just feels.. wrong)

The above are my rants about Jason. The rest is about how things work (or don't work) in the universe. I understand that suspension of disbelief is a thing, but they've built the rules of the universe already and these don't fit within the rules.

5. Considering Jason2 built the box, there must have been an infinite number of Jasons that also built the box and want to find Daniela. Why did only one of them show up?

6. Where did the box come from in all the other worlds that Jason visited? Or where did it come from in Jason1's world? I assume that to visit a world, it must have a box (u can only visit worlds in your ""neighbouring"" realities). So where did they come from? And it can't just be any random box, it has to be specially constructed. It's not like the box moves between worlds either. (It stays in the original)

If you look past all the illogical actions, the story itself is quite nice. But it drives me insane finding the protagonist making all these decisions that just does not make sense.",Rant on Dark matter by Blake Crouch,1621006689
books,"I‚Äôve been wondering about this recently. When I read, it‚Äôs sort of like a movie playing in my head. I remember being a kid reading something and noticing that I wasn‚Äôt really aware of the words on the page as much as the picture in my mind. I‚Äôve heard, however, that this isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs experience, and it makes sense that if you don‚Äôt read in this way (with an automatic mental image) that you probably wouldn‚Äôt enjoy reading.

Then I was thinking about how I listen to a story in a conversation. The same thing happens; I just sort of automatically have a mental image of the story the person is telling me. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has a disconnect between how they read and how they listen. Part of this is because I‚Äôm curious about how audiobooks compare to people‚Äôs experiences reading. For instance, if reading is just words for you, but listening gives you an automatic mental image, then maybe audiobooks could be a way to get stories that are only available as books.

I feel like this might be the case, because I find that a lot of people that don‚Äôt enjoy reading do enjoy audiobooks and I‚Äôm wondering if maybe this is the reason.",How do you read vs how do you listen?,1621006497

books,"I completed the unfinished Dead Souls by Russian author, Nikolai Gogol

In fact, the work is public domain now since it was published in the 1800's: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1081/1081-h/1081-h.htm

For those of you who don't know Gogol, he was a prominent writer in his lifetime. He's featured on various banknotes in Ukraine and Russia and there's a statue of him in Moscow. Since reading The Witcher, I've been looking for other Slavic fantasy books. Gogol wrote dozens of books during his lifetime.

Dead Souls was supposed to be a planned trilogy of books by Gogol however, he ended up finishing the 2nd book and destroying the novels before his death. The stories say that he burned the manuscripts. But from what he did write, it was amazing. Slavic mythology is underrated and not known very well in the West. Most people only know Baba Yaga now cause of John Wick. But there's other interesting characters like the rusalka, black horseman, etc. Overall, an interesting fantasy series. But unfortunately, unfinished.

Anybody else read Dead Souls? If there was a 3rd book, how do think the story would have been concluded? And what are your thoughts on Gogol?
