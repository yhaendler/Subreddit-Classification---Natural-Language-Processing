Scientific computing with python 

Data analysis with python 

Machine learning with python

datascience,"Howdy!

We've just added another few free dataset downloads to our project (Gourdian), this time from the EPA Air Quality System, daily levels of the following pollutants from measuring stations throughout the US, going back to 1980:

* Carbon Monoxide (CO): https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs.co_daily_summary
* Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2): https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs.no2_daily_summary
* Ozone (O3): https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs.ozone_daily_summary
* Sulfur Dioxide (SO2): https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs.so2_daily_summary

This dataset is only updated twice per year.

Why should you care about these things? Well, they're pretty nasty pollutants, which frequently affect human health, especially over long exposure periods. Perhaps concentrations should affect where we build homes more than they do, for example? They're also useful proxies for various types of human activity.

**Carbon monoxide** can be deadly in high concentrations, as it binds to hemoglobin, and makes it so that one's blood can't carry as much oxygen. Created via combustion of fossil fuels.

**Nitrogen dioxide** is one of the results of road traffic and other fossil fuel combustion, is one of the precursors for other harmful pollutants such as ozone and particulates, and plays a role in the formation of acid rain (it becomes nitric acid). It's also generally correlated with exposure to other byproducts of road traffic, many of which have been linked to respiratory illnesses and systemic inflammation, which can lead to a whole host of other health issues.

**Ozone** is a powerful oxidant, which makes it so that it can cause damage to respiratory tissues. It also attacks various polymers like rubber, eventually causing it to crack. It's formed primarily from photochemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (like NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). High concentrations aren't limited to urban areas, however, and it can travel hundreds of miles downwind from the source.

Finally, **sulfur dioxide**. Formed largely by the combustion of fossil fuels with high levels of sulfur, as well as volcanic activity. It's a precursor to acid rain (it becomes sulfuric acid). Sulfur dioxide is known to be at least mildly toxic, and can be hazardous in high concentrations. Long term exposure to low concentrations can also be problematic. The amount of sulfur in fossil fuels vary widely by type - automotive gasoline has much less than bunker fuel commonly used by container ships, for example.

If you'd like to download any part of these, you can filter down to the parts you care part via the lat/long filter (button on the map to select area) or by year, via sliders. As you do this, the download size noted on the download button in the upper right should change. When you've got the part you want, click download, and you should get a CSV.

A bit about our goals and what we're trying to build:

* Filter (optional), click the button, CSV arrives on your hard drive
* Downloads are always a single CSV, no bundles with weird directory structures, no other formats
* CSVs are indexed and filterable by a few column types (lat/long and date/time at the moment), so you can download just the parts you want
* Open licensed datasets are free to download
* No signup required for downloading open datasets
* Search within and across datasets

datascience,"Hi all,

I'm in an advantageous yet difficult situation. I have the opportunity to choose between computational dissertation project (Ph.D. in Pharmacology) and an industry role as a Data Analyst at a logistics company where I will be the first of this role and able to direct the initiatives and grow. If I leave for the industry role, I will receive a terminal M.S. degree in Pharmacology on my way out.

 I want to know what is going to serve me better in 5 years if my goal is to be in a position where I get to input on the right questions for the business, manage a team underneath me, perform hypothesis testing, and be able to explore some modeling to predict business relevant metrics (i.e. I'm thinking more straightforward models like predicting project duration, costs, profit -- not some ensemble or super boosted model). In my mind this role exists with the title of Data Scientist/Senior Data Analyst depending on the company (which does not need to be bio-related). *Please correct me if I'm off*. 

To describe my timeline briefly:

1. I entered grad school with the goal of getting my PhD and becoming a medical science liaison (communicates scientific findings and technical knowledge to other researchers, MDs, etc.)
2. This became less attractive after talking to some MSLs -&gt; existential crisis -&gt; recommendation from a professor that I pick up useful skills -&gt; started learning R programming, exploratory data analysis, shored up on inferential statistics, etc. (and found that I really enjoyed the lot)
3. Research into the DS career and communication with many Bio PhD folks turned DS led me to believe that a Bio PhD is only relevant/useful for obtaining at DS job *if* it is accompanied by a project that involves the application of advanced statistics or actual machine learning techniques to the project. *This is my opinion so far.*
4. I struggled with my Advisor A to come up with a project that allowed me to develop those skills and work toward his lab goals
5. I began applying for jobs (DS and Data Analyst, DA).  Around this time, my plight became known to other professors, and one of them offered to be my new Advisor (Advisor B) and let me work on a heavy computational project in his lab. Additionally, one of those jobs has progressed to a final round interview, and I am fairly confident that I will be offered the position.

My question re-stated is **which of these opportunities will be better for me in the long run?** I have described each opportunity more in-depth below if you would like more information.

Other questions for professional data folks in the field: 

* What is your opinion of the usefulness of a PhD that is not in CS, Statistics, Math, DS when applied to a DS or senior DA role? 
* What is your opinion of colleagues with Bio PhDs whom you work with in the DS role?
* @ Bio PhD people who now work DS, what does the landscape look like? Has your PhD benefitted you in *any* way (i.e. useful domain knowledge, stats, ability to get an interview, the way you are treated by colleagues, increased/decreased opportunities, payment and benefits)?

**My current opinion:** 

I have not taken the webscrape LinkedIn or Indeed for data related to all DS/DA jobs approach. My research into these roles, however, suggests to me that an M.S. degree may be sufficient long-term. Most roles ask for either a Ph.D. or an M.S. + X years of experience. I think I may be better off taking an M.S. and getting years of actual experience in the field. Moreover, if I need to do some self-learning to cover machine learning concepts or whatever, I will have more free time to do this with an industry position compared to my Ph.D. work. I'm leaning toward accepting the offer. However, I welcome any comments, suggestions, or insight you all have with the exception of the first bullet below.

**To note:**

* I'm not interested in arguments that fit the sunk cost fallacy -- no one can get any time already spent back, and the time spent is not worthless because of the experience and insight gained
* I'm 26 if that helps
* All my professors are in the know about these opportunities, and steps have been taken to give me the ability to make either decision
* I do not know how long the dissertation project would take if I accepted that project nor do I know where they Profs want to publish -- they do know that I am interested in leaving ASAP and seem amenable to that
* I think both opportunities are equally interesting, and I'm trying to ignore the fact that the industry position comes with a pay increase and likely a better work-life balance. I'm trying to view it through the lens of which is better long-term.

**More information about both opportunities (*****if you're interested*****):**

The industry position is a Data Analyst role on their continuous improvement team. This company is in a position where they are growing and doing well selling machinery and software to improve logistic methods for other companies that move products (i.e. warehousing). They are accumulating data but do not have the know-how to best utilize it. They are even lacking ETL pipelines that pull data from different departments to a centralized data warehouse and then send that data to dashboards or reporting tools (i.e. what I'd call low-hanging fruit). They also have not entirely determined what KPIs to track or what they want to measure moving forward. They have one person with the title ""Master Data Specialist,"" and I would work with this person, *potentially* giving me someone who could mentor me in this role. **What I see** is a great opportunity to direct how they organize and use their data, to have input on what questions are being asked, and the opportunity to say that I helped build up the Data team within the continuous improvement group.

The dissertation project is a project where I will lead the analysis of data from a large multi-omic study.  *Omics is basically an approach where tissue is taken from a sample, put through a big scary bio machine, and hundreds to thousands of X (where X is proteins, genes, lipids, metabolites) are identified and quantified.* *These quantities are comparable across disease groups.* The advisor and his collaborators have multiple tissue types from hundreds of samples categorized by disease group. They have data for proteins, lipids, metabolites, etc. Their idea broadly is to use a network analysis approach to analyze the covariance between these X and determine clusters of related X \[WGCNA\]([https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/](https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/)). These clusters are then summarized using databases of X IDs and their known functions/significance to determine what biological process that cluster broadly represents. These ""scores"" for these clusters can then be compared across disease groups to produce biological insight. Additionally, clusters drawn from each X can be compared to each other X. This project also involves many use cases of hypothesis testing like linear modeling, ANOVA and t-test (or their non-parametric analogs), hypergeometric tests, etc. **What I see** is the opportunity to do some cool research, have experience with advanced statistical techniques albeit mostly used in biology, and obtain my Ph.D. I worry though that this network analysis approach isn't translatable (or more importantly, won't be viewed as translatable) outside of the biological context. I already have lots of experience doing hypothesis testing, so that is covered.

If you've made it this far, I appreciate you reading my novel and thank you for any suggestions you may have.",Which opportunity will be better for me in 5 years? 1) Pharmacology Ph.D. doing a project using WGCNA/network analysis/differential expression on multiple 'omics data or 2) a Data Analyst role with a lot of opportunity to control the direction of the team and learn full stack skills,1617901987

Hi guys,

Need advice on the analytics use case. I have around **60** odd BI reports (cloud based data reports for employees across globe). I need to identify similar ones so that the reports can be merged and number of data models can be reduced.

Data:

Excel sheet with following columns:

Column 1: Report ID (60 reports)

Column 2: Sub category -( reports have been categorized into 4 sub-parts based on usage )

Column 3: Table names which from which data is being fetched Can be more than 1.

Column 4: Names of users who use the report ( not more than 10)

Column 5: Report Field names - SI, CI etc = final columns that we arrive at, after using function etc on the data

Based on these columns/Data for each report, is there a way I can find similar or merge-able reports to reduce the number of data models.

Somebody suggested clustering, but wasn't sure about it.

So is there a Data Science way/method that i can apply here with good enough accuracy. Any advice would be a huge help.

datascience,"So I'm currently enrolled in [Eastern University's online MS in Data Science](https://www.eastern.edu/academics/graduate-programs/ms-data-science). I haven't finished the degree yet, but I'm far enough into it that I can give an honest assessment for those interested in enrolling.

# First, the good stuff:

* Eastern University puts their students first. The professors, administrators, and admissions staff at EU have it together when it comes to solving problems and interacting with students. They usually respond to my emails within an hour and give helpful feedback.
* EU is *super* military-friendly. I'm using the Post-9/11 GI Bill to fund my studies. If you have 100% GI Bill, then you get a degree for free and pocket *at least* $15k in stipends. Even if you only have 60% GI Bill like I do, you'll still net around $6k. At Eastern, you only need to take *one class* at a time to qualify as a full-time student, so you can collect that $894/month stipend while only enrolled in a single class. They also offer a $30 per credit discount for veterans and active duty personnel. If you're using tuition assistance while serving, the *whole program* will only cost you $500 out of pocket, which is an *insanely* good deal for a graduate degree.
* Everything is self-directed. No weekly modules. If you burn the midnight oil, you can finish an entire seven-week course in just a week or two! That's quite convenient if you're a full-time working professional with an unpredictable schedule.
* The professor's videos give a clear description on how to use programming languages. I enrolled with *zero* programming experience, but they hold your hand through the whole thing and explain in detail how it all works at a theoretical level. I usually have the instructional videos open in one window and my Python editor open in another so I can pause and play around with it. It's an effective way to learn.

# And, there are a few drawbacks:

* Academically, it's not super challenging. For example, all the assignments can be retaken until you get the grade you want. Also, as an online program, it's possible for an unscrupulous student to cheat their way through, although I have no idea why someone would spend all this money on a degree to learn data science and then just ""coast"" through the program. If you want to gain proficiency with Python, R, statistics, etc., you'll have to practice writing code and crunching numbers on your own in addition to the class assignments. They do, however, provide you with all the learning materials you need to gain proficiency.
* The student account website isn't the most user-friendly. Simply signing up for a new class is a drawn-out, cumbersome process that took me a while to figure out. The learning management system they use, Brightspace, isn't the most efficient either.

# The bottom line:

I know this sounds cliche, but **you'll get out of this program what you put into it**. If you only do the bare minimum to pass each course, you can pay all this money just to get a fancy diploma, but lack the data science knowledge to succeed in the real world. If you go the extra mile and take time to master the material on your own, you'll have a strong enough foundation in data science to get into the industry, gain experience, and build a successful career in a lucrative field. EU's program is a convenient and affordable option for working professionals who want to branch out into data science and have the motivation to work for it.

# And now, I'll answer a few Frequently Asked Questions:

**How much time per week would I need to put in as a student?**  
It varies depending on how much time you need to practice and how many classes you take. Each course is seven weeks long. I've been taking one course per term while working full-time as a civil engineer, part-time as a national guard officer, and taking care of my 9-month old daughter and I still have had plenty of time to finish each class with a few weeks to spare. If you plan ahead each week, it's possible to balance this program with a full-time job.  


**Eastern University isn't as prestigious/high-ranking as (for example) UT-Austin or Georgia Tech. How will employers judge a degree from EU?**  
I wouldn't worry too much about university rankings. Once you're in the industry and have experience, no one cares where you got your degree. You'll also find that many data scientists are completely self-taught and have degrees in unrelated subjects. Some of them don't have degrees at all! For example, my brother attended a bottom-tier, open-enrollment university and studied computer science for a few semesters before dropping out. Even though he never finished his degree, he became proficient at writing code and now makes six figures as a software engineer. All you have to do is get good enough at writing the code to pass a technical interview to make yourself marketable.  


**Do I even need a degree for this career field? Isn't it possible to learn data science simply by watching YouTube videos?**  
Yes, it is possible to learn data science on your own, but the structure of a degree program makes it easier to keep a consistent study schedule. It also gives you something palpable to list on a resume when you start applying for jobs. As I've stated earlier, many private sector tech companies are loose on degree requirements, *however* government and military jobs stipulate certain degrees for their applicants. I currently work for DOD as an engineer, and every time I apply for a new position within our department, I have to submit my transcript along with it. An MS in Data Science can help you land a federal job as a data engineer, operations research analyst, statistician, etc.

Basically my issue is not enough skills, education or time to solve the former. My plan was to go to grad school but got a good job offer and took it. I've realized since working that I still absolutely plan on going to grad school but do not want to do it at night/part time.

I don't necessarily want the bare basics, I'm looking to get a more intermediate source if possible. I'll be using this type of regression for company analysis and economics so if you have any comments on whether logarithmic regression is the right type, go ahead. I think it is because in business we always talk about strong growth periods followed by a levelling off. This typically applies to economics as well, since economics is the sum of all businesses. It's just a much longer time frame. 

Any suggestions would be nice! From tools within regression, to any curriculums you suggest I go through, books, anything would be nice.

Thanks guys!",Sources to learn logarithmic regression?,1617848147
datascience,"Metadata management is the proactive use of metadata in an organization to govern data in order to enable well-informed business decisions and efficiency in data handling. Metadata management involves ingesting metadata to learn about the data an organization owns, its value, and the optimization of data storage and its retention.

***Enhanced data quality***

Through automation, data quality is gradually assured with the governing and operationalization of the data pipeline to the benefit of all data stakeholders. All data issues and inconsistencies within an organization’s integrated data sources are captured in real-time, thus improving overall data quality. This also increases the time taken to draw insights from the data.

***Faster project delivery timelines***

By automating [metadata management](https://www.dqlabs.ai/free-trial/data-catalog/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=referral), greater accuracy levels of up to 70% ensure the acceleration of project delivery for data movement and deployment of projects. Automated metadata management gathers metadata from different data sources and maps all data elements from their sources to target and enhances data integration across various platforms.

***Enhanced speed to make insights***

Currently, data scientists spend up to 80% of their time gathering and understanding data and resolving errors instead of analyzing it to draw real value. This time can be reduced greatly by the use of stronger data operations and analytics, leading to drawing insights faster, with access to underlying metadata.

***Improved productivity &amp; reduced costs***

Reliance on automated and repeatable metadata management systems and processes leads to improved productivity and reduced costs.

***Regulatory compliance***

Data regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Health Insurance and Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA), and The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are to be complied with, depending on the area an organization is located and the type of operations they are engaged in. When critical data is not collected, cataloged, classified, and standardized in integration processes, compliance audits may be inaccurate. Metadata management ensures that sensitive data is automatically flagged and tagged, it is then automatically documented, and its flows captured so that it is easily noticed and its use across various workflows easily detected.

***Digital transformation***

Metadata management enables knowledge of what data exists and its potential value, thus promoting digital transformation through;

* Improved digital experiences by enhanced understanding of how an organization interacts with its customers
* Enhanced digital operations by improving the speed of data preparation and analysis

Metadata management brings about business value, thereby improving innovation, collaboration and helps to mitigate imminent risks. [Metadata management solutions](https://www.dqlabs.ai/data-catalog/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=referral) like DQLabs.ai helps organizations to access high-quality and trusted data, in order to ensure that they get accurate insights from their data for optimal business goals.",Benefits of Metadata Management,1617845713

datascience,"Hello, currently a sophomore doing some classical stat analysis at a lab on campus. It’s a driving simulation laboratory so it’s mainly doing analysis on the data  they get between two different scenarios and doing some hypothesis testing. 

Anyways the lab manager told me how my analysis was completely wrong and how I mishandled the data because apparently I joined two datasets which weren’t supposed to and ended up with duplicates. 

I’m kinda bummed that I made this mistake cause I felt pretty confident about and proud of my results.

datascience,"I've been working in my first job 2 years out of my masters degree as a ""financial analyst"" at a large engineering company. I use historical manufacturing/material/project data to quantify risks for contract proposals. 

For example, one proposal I worked on: engineering design project with 500 activities to complete. 

(1) Calculated duration averages &amp; standard deviations of historical similar steps and assumed normal distributions for each.

(2) Ran monte carlo simulation of project with variable durations along their unique distributions to generate PDF of finish dates &amp; compared to deterministic ""most likely"" plan. 

(3) Applied to cost escalation profile to probability function to generate range of potential costs, allowing us to bake in risk-adjusted margin into proposal.

I have an engineering undergrad &amp; finance masters. I find statistics/data very interesting, and would like to move into a data science position in the future.

datascience,"I've got a dataset of consumer transaction with over 1mil+ entries. I have to sort the data into the merchant the transactions are coming from. There's a lot of false positives, especially coming from payment methods (i.e. an entry might say ""Online Payment 1234567890 To CAPITAL ONE AUTO FINANCE 12/15"", I want to identify the merchant ""CAPITAL ONE AUTO FINANCE"", even though ""Online Payment"" is more frequent in the dataset) 

The format of the transactions is not universally the same. To make matters more complicated, the merchant names vary–""CAPITAL ONE AUTO FINANCE"" may become ""CAPIT ONE ATO FINANCE""

I would greatly appreciate any advice about going about this task, be it any tools, tips or tricks. I'm new to processing datasets, and my process is pretty brute force. Also, does anyone have experience contracting out work like this?

datascience,"Hey folks, I am doing my Master's in Data Analytics and I aim to be a Deep Learning Engineer in the next 1-3 years. I am not quite sure how feasible such a target is but well! I still wanna try. Anyways, for the analytics project in our college, we have got some choices to pick from and I want to pick the projects that would turn out to be most relevant for my back up plan(or long-term goals). While none of them are related to CV or NLP directly, I still want to be doing it with dedication so that I could get into business analytics as a back-up plan (since, I understand that I might not be able to be a deep learning Engineer fresh out of college). Anyways, my project choices are as follows and can you throw some thoughts on what seems more promising in terms of the evolving research or importance with respect to the current industry demands or which choices would be most helpful for me if I were to look for jobs showing off that project, ikr, jk! :p

1. Predicting Penalty shots based on player positions (using discreet choice models)
2. Predicting car driver choices like accelerating, brake, left-/right-turn etc ( using discreet choice models)
3. Analyzing and predicting mode of transport choice behavior in London (using Multinomial Logistic Regression)
4. Predicting electric vehicle purchase choices (by increasing charging stations) in London (using Multinomial Logistic Regression)
5. Predicting park-and-ride choice in London (using Multinomial Logistic Regression)
6. Predicting boarding time in public transportation vehicles, the alternatives are car, park-and-ride, and public transport (using Multinomial Logistic Regression)
7. a model that is capable of predictions of total boarding times of a coach given the number of egressing and accessing passengers at given doors of a tram/train.

My thoughts respectively:

1. I believe if it were actual video analytics of sports, then I could call it computer vision but this one is more like analyze the player and predict the choice of where would he kick the ball.
2. Sounds pretty close to self-driving cars i.e. CV but not quite sure if this would help me to start off my career really. 
3. this project is about analyzing if a person would take a car or a bike, etc based on influencing variables like weather, temperature, perceived temperature blah blah

Not quite sure about the rest. While I understand the project statements  I can't figure out why some of these projects are very relevant for industries/firms perhaps. I would like to know which projects among those would actually be applied in a business analytics/ data analytics firms directly or if there is good breakthrough/research in any of these applications, I would like to pursue them because at least I would have a good reference or a baseline to do my project. any thoughts?","Need help to select the minor project topic as I am pretty clueless, any thoughts please?[long post]",1617826025
