books,"I wasn't really into fantasy until I read ASOIAF a few years ago. It really isn't just great fantasy, but really great literature overall. 
Since The Winds of Winter doesn't seem to be coming out anytime soon, I started looking for similar books to fill the void. I started reading the Malazan books, and I'm loving them so far. And I've been told The Wheel of Time is great too, but I also read some opinions that said that it's too similar to The Lord of the Rings.

books,"This is one of the first classics I read and, it is the scariest one, and not scary like Frankenstein or Dracula (which for the record are awsome, but not really scary while reading, in my opinion), part of what makes this book scary is its ambiguity, you really don't get a lot of information about anything until the end, you can't even be sure about if there are actual ghost in that ghost story, or if the protagonist is a scary crazy woman, in my opinion her histeria is contagious, this is due to the language used in the book, which is short of preparing us for something dark all the time. The end is extremely shocking and kind of weird, if you want, please leave your interpretations on the book main interrogants, we might have some nice discussion",Another turn of screw,1592610528

books,"I bought a few books recently and was updating my book log when I saw my copy of Frankenstein, which I've had for a few years now, and it's just been sitting on my shelf. After deciding that it's something that I  need to get around to reading I noticed something strange about my copy.

It's a paperback CollinsClassics 200th Anniversary print of the novel, in relatively good condition (there's a small tear on the back cover, but that's it). That's not the strange thing about it though. Right after turning over the front cover, I am greeted with page 167 (the second page of ch 5 in vol. 3). All pages are there from that point to the end of the novel (pg 202), then there is 12 blank (front and back) pages followed by page 39 (the start of ch 4 in vol. 1). The book then continues normally to the end of the novel (pg 202).

Unfortunately for me, I can't return the book due to having bought it at least 2 years ago from ValueVillage in a different town and probably tossed my receipt after I got to where I was going. Now I'm really sad and don't know what to do with my copy.

TL;DR:  I'm missing the first 38 pages of the book (oh, the horror!), and have an extra copy of the last 35 pages plus 12 blank pages in between and can't return the book.",Frankenstein's Monster is NOT the scariest monster,1592602815

books,"This book just isn‚Äôt that good. There's a semblance of a great story beneath the bloated text, but you really have to dig. The prison scenes and escape were great but after that it just completely dies down. I think I have to give up on reading it (currently on page 392 of 875). The rhetoric is dated and very difficult to read.

Here‚Äôs a passage to demonstrate what I mean by bloated. To preface, this passage is between two characters planning a meeting together in the future:

'Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?'  
'Certainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeks' time, that is to say, as fast as I can get there!'  
'Nay,' said the count; ""I will give you three months ere I join you; you see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties.'  
'And in three months time,' said Albert, 'you will be at my house?'  
'Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?' enquired the count; 'only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements.'  
'Day for day, hour for hour,' said Albert.; 'that will suit me to a dot.' - 'So be it, then;' replied the count, and extending his hand towards a calendar, suspended near the chimney-piece, he said, 'today is the 21st of February;' and drawing out his watch, added, 'it is exactly half-past ten o'clock. Now promise me to remember this, and expect me the 21st of May at the same hour in the forenoon.'  
'Capital exclaimed Albert; 'your breakfast shall be waiting.'  
'Where do you live?' - 'No. 27, Rue de Helder.'  
'Have you bachelor's apartments there? I hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience.' - 'I reside in my father's house; but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard, entire separated from the main building.'  
'Quite sufficient,' replied the count, as, taking out his tablets, he wrote down 'No. 27 Rue de Helder, 21st May, half-past ten in the morning'.  

Do we really need to know the exact time and address of the future meeting? And do we really need the count to confirm the appointment word for word?

books,"Hi Redditors! Tl:Dr at the bottom.

With all of the BLM movement happening right now, I wanted to share my first experience with Racism.

As a white, straight, American, Christian male (just to narrow things down), I basically got handed life on a silver plate. I had nothing to fear, nothing to worry about, nothing. I was set for life. 

I knew of racism and implicit biases, but I have never seen them in action until I read Snuff. 

God, that book was so good! I loved every page of it, and I have re-read it many times (which is unusual to me). 

But, Snuff taught me how Racism and stereotypes worked. I was flabbergasted the second time I read it and was picking up on the racist bits. I had no idea someone could treat someone else so badly because of their culture and beliefs. I was so, ignorant then.

Looking at the goblins was what taught me to see past my first impression and focus on the person. I've seen so many stereotyped Goblins in books and even games that I've wondered how long the goblins have suffered from this systemic racism too. 

Snuff taught me to be open to different people. It taught me what racism looked like. 

Did it teach me how to fight it? No, I don't think so. But it gave me the ability to identify it.

Now, I'm still white, straight and Christian, so who knows what else I don't know. But Snuff, Snuff gave me insight to this form of systemic racism. And I don't think I would have ever seen it unless I read Snuff. 

It's probably not the best thing to read right now, but if you are in the mood for something a bit more light-hearted, I think Snuff is a good read. There is a chance to learn, to laugh, and to cry. 

Samuel Vimes is a great man. Our officers should learn a thing or two from him.

Tl:Dr, Snuff is a book about systemic racism, and it is also an enjoyable read too. I highly recommend it if you want something a bit more light-hearted right now.","Snuff, by Terry Pratchett",1592596194

It gives a feel for what it's like to exist in the world for women in general and LBGTQ women in particular. The struggle to be accept and to find a place. The emotions which are unique, but also familiar to everyone. 

Her second book, In The Dream House, while being a true story (if a bit abstract in places) nails the feel of Her Body and roots it in reality.

So I just finished Infinite Jest for the first time, and probably like most people who finish it for the first time I have a lot of thoughts and feelings and questions. I've also spent the last hour devouring summaries and interpretations regarding the end and what happens after the last page/before the first page of the book. So I feel a little more clear about all of that, and a little more appreciative of the book as a whole. I'm sure there's not much I could say that hasn't already been said, but no one I know in real life has read this book so I would love to have a discussion here about some overall impressions and remaining questions I still have!!

\-So is JOI a stand-in for DFW and JOI's movies are stand-ins for Infinite Jest (the book)?  That's pretty much what I got from JOI's wraith discussion with Don Gately. One of the things that bothered me the most about reading the novel was the in depth life stories of so many minor characters... but that's kind of explained when JOI talks about figurants and his films?

\-Was Avril really having sex with Orin like Joelle implied? And is there a widely regarded consensus about what caused Hal's disability?

\-The whole JOI as a ghost thing really was a twist... I feel like it's out of character with the stark realism rest of the book. That's one aspect of it I still can't really digest. It just doesn't jive.

\-I know DFW is DFW, and he wants to challenge the reader, but some of the writing... come on. Is it really okay to frustrate the reader for the sake of frustrating the reader?  I'm talking about all the weird repetitions of obscure vocab (we get it, they're EPHEBES), the run on sentences, the whole page blocks of text, the constant vague misuse of medical terminology (that really drove me nuts... if you're gonna get that weird and specific, at least get it right). Is there a point to these frustrating writing quirks? Or that's just how DFW is? I feel like those aspects of the novel are challenging in a way that's not worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall: I'm glad I stuck with it. It made me think a lot, and I'm going to keep thinking about it for awhile. I really truly loved Hal and Mario's characters- my heart goes out to them. I felt lukewarm about Don Gately throughout. I also now understand how people could stomach re-reading it. I feel like this is a book that will keep giving with each re-read. That being said... I will probably not be re-reading it for a while, lol.

books,"So I am near the end of Well of Ascension book . I didnt like Vin and how stupid she was in falling for Zane. I didn‚Äôt like how she fell in love with Elend in the first book because they had spent so little time together, but thought, OK as long as we have the romance out of the way. It seemed useless unless Zane becomes relevant again in the future. U could have had the same arc without him, but the fact that he looked like Elend cheapens their romance even more. ‚ÄúI am SO HARD TO TRUST but I trust the people I am not supposed to so easily, and they just happen to be the only boys that I would be able to have get it with.‚Äù 

Also, in terms of the seige. I guess this is my own thing and can‚Äôt fault them but if the gates werent meant to be seiged and you know that it cant take a a hammering, why not try sealing off the gates with brick BEHIND the gate. Or at least reinforce the gates! You had months, this should have happened, especially since it wasnt like the city were using the gates anyway! 

Finally, and this is what bothers me the most, they treat Kelsier like he was arrogant and ruthless when. There really was nothing that he did to make any person he knew feel as though they were less and yes he was charismatic and confident and a LEADER. So yes people will gravitate to a leader. Moreso, you KNOW why he tried to become famous- he had a goal and he accomplished that goal. But what is the worst thing is how they say he was ruthless. To sympathize with the enemy of your people who had raped and enslaved your population for a thousand years is not mercy it would have been foolish. And ok if you are saying he was ruthless to the Skaa that helped the nobility- well what was he supposed to do? Try and ask them to join him AS he was destroying the Noble‚Äôs keep?! He didn‚Äôt go to kill a Noble because he thought it was fun; he did it because he was rebelling. Not ONCE did I think he was ruthless in the first book. Yet everyone says he is ruthless-especially Vin - in the second book OVER AND OVER! Vin killed hundreds of men based off of what? The intel given to you by your enemy? The only other person who could have a chance to kill you one on one! Also they dismiss Elend killing Jastes. And he wasn‚Äôt even shaken by killing his best friend! And I am not saying he was wrong to not kill Jastes but he acted as judge, jury, and executioner dor a city he wasn‚Äôt king of. Not to mention if you formed an alliance with him you could have used his power he had in other places. And what of Vin in the first book, she went along with all of it; not because she believed in freeing the Skaa for the majority of the book. She continued because she liked the crew and liked going to the balls. 

I am sure the book ends well- it seems that is probably Sanderson‚Äôs strength.

books,"I recently started using Audible, thinking it would be a good way to make my commute more productive and enjoyable (back when commutes were a thing).  The first book I listened to was *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari, and I think it worked pretty well - sometimes I would get distracted by something in the real world and would be a bit lost for a while when I ""tuned back in"", but broadly speaking it worked.

Then I decided to try *Norwegian Wood* by Haruki Murakami.  I really like Murakami but I figured it might be hard to focus on some of his more surrealist stuff while I'm on the move, so I chose *Norwegian Wood* as I knew it was more ""normal"" (for want of a better term) than many of his other works.  The problem is, I found myself really disliking the narration of the dialogue in the book.  A lot of the dialogue is between a man and a woman and listening to a man narrate both sides just, I dunno, broke immersion for me or something.

So now I'm thinking that books that require a lot of thought probably aren't great for listening to while on the go, and neither are books with a lot of dialogue between diverse characters (which could be difficult for a single narrator to portray realistically).  It's making it difficult to figure out what books I should listen to and what what books I should save for when I next visit a bookshop.

Anyway, I started reading The Stand about 2 weeks ago (I'm 550 pages in) and I think I chose the perfect time to read the book. I mean the first part happens in June and has a global pandemic in it. I think it made the experience of reading the first part a lot more realistic and scary. So if anyone is interested in reading The Stand I think now is the best time to do so. Also, I don't really understand the fear of big books some people have, I only read 3 books before starting The Stand (all under 500 pages) and I didn't think of starting The Stand as a challenge or something, it's just that I know I could have finished 2 or 3 books by the time I finish The Stand, but I have no reason to rush and finish as many books as I can. Anyway, I'm really liking The Stand so far, the characters are great. And I hope that some of ya'll who are scared of big books give them a try, just think of it as reading one chapter at a time. 
Just wanted to share that, stay safe.",I chose the perfect time to read The Stand.,1592585539

I really enjoyed the first part of the book but the second half was bad. The first half was good and believable but the second part didnt feel believable and a bit rushed. For example in the first half they had this story between Armpit and his crush titiana going on but in the second half they just rushed over it by her cancelling on going with armpit to the concert and then just forgetting about it which piseed me off has I enjoyed there story",My review on Small Steps by louis sachar,1592581556

books,"Hello everyone.

This is my first post here and to be frank - I don't read a lot of books, at least no more. When I was a kid, I used to devour them, as I grew, they grew out of me. Now with my 20 years I have to read literary works for University. And so it came that I finished my third book this year: Great Expectations by Charles Dickens.

I am writing these lines mere moments after finishing this book because I am inconsolable. The book had started slow, I grew to like the ""back and forth"" between Pip and Estella, that is so typical for 19th century books (at least in my knowledge and in the comparison to Pride and Prejudice).

The middle to end had many plot twists - Spoiler warning on this part. That the benefactor of Pip was not Havisham, but the old man. That Estella was the daughter of said man. That the former partner of Magvich was the brother of Havisham. So many jaw-dropping moments. I didn't think I'd like a book from the 19th century as much as I liked this book - but here I am.

Or - here I *was*. This all brings us... to the end. Magvich dead. Pip poor. It couldn't get worse, right? But Joe came, Pip could return back to his old life, marry Biddy - but alas... Joe has married Biddy. On the day that Pip came back. My jaw dropped. Not for happy surprise. But because of the sheer devastation. I fully believed at this moment that Pip would try to kill himself in the moors, after leaving the forge. It was pure devastation. I am even struggling to put my thoughts into words and I think this revelation hit me harder than it hit Pip. It was his last straw - and it slipped away.

""Everything turned to the better"", of course. He went with Herbert. He lived. He survived. But I don't think he quite *lived* anymore. We do not get any information about this time - but I think he was broken. A broken man with a broken heart. 

Then he returned and to top it all off, met Estella, which got divorced and also lost all her belongings. She wasn't as beautiful but apparently learned lessons in life, about being gentle and caring. This part I don't actually understand and if any of you could enlighten me - did they marry in the end? Did they leave together as Pip saw ""no shadow of parting from her""? I don't even know how to read this - is there no ""shadow of parting"" is there no shadow of ""parting from her""?

I don't even know if this could be considered a happy end for him. Does he deserve Estella? Does Estella deserve him? Do they deserve each other? Do they need each other? I don't think this will repair any of the broken hearts. I don't think anything will be ""good"" ever again.

At last, I have a weird question - does anybody know if anybody ever wrote an ""alternative happy ending"" for Great Expectations? I know, that it probably very pathetic but I cannot live with this ending. It leaves my heart aching and sorrowful.

Thanks for reading such far. Hope I adhered to all rules of this subreddit. Cheers. Have a good day. And have a good life - at least one better than Pip had.","I have just finished ""Great Expectations"" and I am devastated.",1592580542

It was a little to mediocre and run of the mill, in my opinion, to be aclaimed as this game changer, phenomenal publication.
