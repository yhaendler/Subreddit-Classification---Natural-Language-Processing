books,"Hopefully this doesn’t get taken down for being promotional spam. I’m honestly just astounded by this listening experience and really wanted to share.

To reiterate, there is a free-to-listen theatrical audiobook of The Hobbit on YouTube by Bluefax. There’s music, sound effects, background voices, and the narrator is an absolute delight to listen to.

Growing up as a kid I had a hard time with Tolkien’s writing and I still struggle with reading his works to this day. In fact, I prefer the movies to the books because I struggled so much with them (yes, even The Hobbit. I know. It’s a controversial preference).

But I can hands down say that this audiobook has changed my mind. This is *the way* to experience this story (or re-experience it for many of you I hope). I’ve just finished listening to half of Chapter 14 where Smaug is slain and I’m literally out of breath and my heart is racing.

I was shocked by how little views these videos had. So I just wanted to let y’all know that this audiobook exists.

The only downside is that normal audiobooks may be ruined for you forever though.",I’m nearly done listening to the Bluefax theatrical audiobook (free on YouTube) of The Hobbit. If you’re a fan of Tolkien you should really experience this version.,1593473985
books,"Sorry to be bragging in such an outright way, but I'm really happy about this. Reading used to be an absolute breeze through middle school and high school, but just everything about college kind of took my motivation to read and flushed it down the toilet. During the entire last school year, I barely got through a single book, and felt really bad about it.  I thought I couldn't ever get back into reading like this again. Seems like something good came out of quarantine after all :)

books,"How Emotions are Made by Lisa Feldmen Barrett was really disappointing. I generally enjoy books on cognition and psychology, but this one was pretty bogus.  It started off with an interesting premise but utterly failed to provide a coherent theory and contradicted itself a lot. 

The main theory of the book is that emotions are learned behavior and not ingrained, which I think there is a bit of truth to this, but not at all in the way the author presents. She ends up positing that emotions are a combination of thoughts and feelings... And goes on to explain that you can't have an emotion until you learn it from someone. 

One example she gives is schadenfreude which she says is an emotion... But it's not, it's the emotion of feeling happy, with the reason for the happiness being someone else's misfortune. One can certainly experience schadenfreude without knowing the definition of that term. 

I enjoyed the discussion where she was examine the biological basis for feelings, but the only actual criticism she had for that study is that there's no biological difference (that we can find) between the emotions of anger and fear. Which makes a lot of sense as they are nearly identical reactions to stress and are analogous to fight or flight.   When fight or flight is triggered  you assess the situation and determine whether to fight (anger) or flee (fear), but that doesn't mean the base response is biologically different based on the chosen response. 

At the end of the book she said dogs couldn't have emotions because they don't have the vocabulary. There's something to be discussed about how an animal may  experience and express emotions differently than humans (or even human to human) but to claim animals don't have emotions is ridiculous. 

She further said that we should get rid of juries and replace them with just the single judge... But how moving that kind of decision from a group of people which would statistically be more objective to a single person which would cause a greater influence of one individuals emotions was reached is unfathomable. Just bonkers.

books,"The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu is a really novel book. 

Cixin Liu is a Chinese author and the book takes place in China. Starts with some episodes during the cultural revolution at a radar base in China and proceeds through modern era. 

The book is based on currently unsolved mathematical and physical problems. Although it's hard to explain what it's about without just giving it all away. 

It begins with unexplained physical phenomenon happening in the world and follows Wang as he is picked up by the government to help investigate the problem. 

The translation is excellent. The characters all have a subtly different perspective on life and how they fit in the world than is generally found in western literature, but not extremely so. It was enjoyable to get some of that differing perspective. It's difficult to explain the actual difference. It probably has more to do with how they frame their decisions than the actual actions they take.

I still struggle with maintaining concentration while reading though, and want to ask how other people manage to get round this. 

Do you have tactics for maintaining focus even in dense or dull texts? 

I find that active reading helps. If I am reading a text to find a certain bit of information or argument, I am much more focussed. 

Also if I am familiar with the topic, that helps. I can draw more connections to existing knowledge and being able to contextualise new information as I am reading it seems to stop my attention from drifting off. But comprehending a text that has been written on a topic I am not familiar with sometimes is impossible. 

Do any of you have good questions to ask in general whilst reading any text? Good active reading questions to keep in mind to maintain focus?

books,"It baffles me that a novel can be damaged by an author trying TOO hard, but it can really be a serious immersion problem. I'm nearly 400 pages into a novel that I've been truly loving so far: *Night Film* by Marisha Pessl. I'm sure many of you have either heard of it or read it. It's a thriller/mystery where the lead investigator meets a ton of different characters throughout his journey to uncover the truth. My problem is that basically every character speaks pretty much exactly how the author otherwise writes every other character or bit of description in the novel. It's honestly ridiculous and beginning to become a huge issue for me. Takes this little snippet of dialogue that's spoken by some random washed up actress that we otherwise know nothing about:

""I've held onto that day, like some faded postcard. Something you put in a scrapbook to remind yourself of perfect happiness-that it does exist, for one moment, like a sudden streak of lightning through the sky.""

*Come on*. Who the hell talks like this? Nobody speaks in sweeping, beautiful similes and descriptive passionate prose during a routine, everyday conversation with a stranger. I'm struggling to get through the dialogue at this point which is a real shame because the writer is obviously skilled, but for some reason they feel the need to overwrite their dialogue instead of focusing on natural, immersive speech and I find this to be a glaring flaw.
