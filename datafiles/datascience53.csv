As somebody currently looking to recruit in the uk, I thought I’d share what I’m looking for (if you’re interested, feel free to make contact, particularly if you’ve read the below and have some content!)

I’ve been working in what we’ve called statistics, then analysis, then analytics and now data science for about 20 years [1]. What sets any data scientist apart is domain knowledge. The data science bit is fiercely competitive and (arguably) the most straightforward bit - get taught, download the software and algorithms and know your stuff. The domain knowledge is what will set you apart. 

I work in (real-world) infrastructure. Anyone who has bothered to understand the challenges in productivity and resilience in physical infrastructure will grab my attention at CV and interview. So be that person. 

If you’re looking to break into an industry, don’t learn the data science [2], learn the industry. What keeps the CEO up at night? Who is going to care about what your AI/ML algorithm is telling them? What decisions are you going to change?

And good luck - these are horrible times in which to be trying to kick start your career. The great thing is if you are a decent data scientist, you will find roles in today’s climate.

I am currently finishing up a  master's degree in Industrial Engineering with a focus on statistics. I have taken and am currently taking courses on simulation, predictive modeling (focus on ML), ethics in AI, data analytics using R, and time series analysis along with more traditional Operations Research classes. I'm now applying for jobs and I am finding that I might be overqualified for data analytics jobs that some of my peers have (that are excel based) but under qualified for data science roles at the same companies. I didn't expect to be in this situation, where jobs I am quite interested and I believe I have a good background for would prefer CS students instead. I think I have to change the roles I am looking for, and I would appreciate any advice. I have done several internships including with an advanced analytics team, but it seems that many of these non-traditional ML type roles favor having more experience.

datascience,"I'm one year into my career in Data Analytics and I'm trying to map out what path I want to follow. I've put some thought into my motivations and two of the bigger motivators are financial security and work-life balance. On the former, I'm currently 30 and at the start of my career so am a bit behind in saving to buy a house, pay the mortgage and a pension. Another motivator is specialism. I'm not so interested in staying in one industry and building domain knowledge, but more interested in being able to derive keen insights in whatever industry I'm in. Therefore requiring foundational skills, such as problem definition, analytical thinking, business acumen, and in time stuff like stakeholder management, actually using my degree(BSc Maths with Stats) and applying the correct, more advanced, statistical techniques at the appropriate time. I'll continue to work on this but assuming that goes to plan and nothing else changes I'd be working up the ranks.

This brings us to the next decision; data analytics or data science. It also seems an appropriate time to mention I live in London, I've also thought about working internationally (in Europe most likely). Backtracking to my motivators; I don't want to have money worries but I'm not sure if I'd want to trade-off work-life balance long term for a ""life of luxury"". I have heard the work-life balance is not as good in data science. However, there is a curiosity about data science, where I might get bored of data analytics once I feel I've ""mastered"" it. Given all this, is data science worth getting into over data analytics?

As a further question, if anyone is still reading; if data science, then how do I get into it? Transition to the role through work and self-learning or Masters? I'm under the impression a Masters is generally required, but I'm not so sure if it is possible to get into without postgrad. If masters I think I have a good chance of getting into among the best universities in the world. And I'm not really interested in some certification or MOOC.",Mapping out a career path,1600518686

I would run it Sunday night and then provide the 7-day predictions (or have it auto-refresh daily if possible). I have access to just about any data one would hope to have so assume we have whatever we need.

A couple things to take into account:

- Staffing will affect originations and at this time we do not have the ability incorporate those variables (e.g. future work schedules).
- We are a startup and only have a few years of data which has been fairly volatile - especially as of late with the pandemic...

My first model seemed to be reasonably accurate and was built by combining historic conversion rates with outstanding unconverted loan volume + predicted volume over the next week. 

However, I'm worried it is a bit too one-dimensional (but who knows, that might be a good thing) and wanted to get feedback from individuals who had done something similar as to how they approached it.

Using Excel w/ Real Stats add-in.


I'm playing a marketing game for a class I'm taking and it's not really a part of the class, but I'm trying to do a bit of analytics.  I've been doing fine with other analytics I've been doing such as determining components within various brand of bikes (made up) create a higher judgement/reception of their brand.


However, advertisements for the brands are also judged and I can't seem to get it right.  The original data is in the ""Ad Content"" and is based on the various subjects used in the ads (chosen in the game).  In the game you can choose as little as 1 up to 9 of the options seen in the Ad Contents, and then set their priority 1-9 with 1 being the highest priority 9 being the least priority.  In my dataset I used for the regression I reversed that as I'm using 0 for a baseline for un-used options, so 9 is highest priority and 1 is the least.  The professor mentioned if you put too many you may see a drop in ad judgement due to a 'too busy' ad, so that's in there as well in the last column (a count of non-zeros).


Not looking for anyone to 'do it for me' but any help / advice would be appreciated.  But if anyone could provide me any non-excel examples of the analysis I'd appreciate that too even as just something to compare to.

**Data science**\- a word that has been creating buzz for quite sometime now. In recent years, the amount of data that has been produced by several industries is beyond calculation. Therefore, the concept of **data science** is what helps these companies handle this massive data. This is where the **importance of data science** lies. **Data science** can be thought of as a collection of disciplines and areas of expertise in order to get thorough, detailed and meaningful insights from raw data. **Data science** professionals must be skilled in everything starting from mathematics to statistics to computer programming to advanced visualisation to be able to distinguish the muddled masses from the important information and extract only the vital bits to make innovations happen. There has been a consistent growth in the demand for data scientists in India as various organisations are adopting new technologies and learning the meaningful insights of data through these technologies has become a necessity. **Data science technology** has turned out to be a very attractive career option for both freshers and experienced working professionals as the demand for **data science jobs** in sectors such as information technology, telecom, manufacturing, financial services, retail, automobiles, etc. is indeed very high. Therefore, it is very clear how **data science** as a career is very fruitful and if that is what you are looking for then down below is a detailed analysis of that.

# Benefits of a data science career

A study conducted by a website recently revealed that there has been a notable increase in the **data science and analytics** domain with respect to job sectors in India in the recent years. This has led to the increase in the average salaries of these **data science jobs** and an increase in proportion of **data science** professionals, especially the experienced ones. When it comes to salary trends across various cities, Mumbai leads the chart of highest salaries with a whopping 15lakhs closely followed by Bangalore with a median salary of 14lakhs. The study also hinted that there has been a growth of about 14% in the salary range as compared to the previous year. So, it should be crystal clear by now that the **data science** career is of extreme value and pursuing **data science technology** as a career would really be beneficial. As companies across different sectors are using various data analysing tools to extract meaningful insights from raw data, it is most likely for the demand of **data science jobs** and professionals to increase in the near future. **Data science technology** is a new field and there is a lot of scope for this field to grow as the **importance of data science** will only increase rather than diminishing.

# Sectors in India having an impact of data science

There is one area of **data science** which has been evolving rapidly and has left its impact in various areas. The subject or field is of **Big data analytics**. There are mainly two big avenues (largely) in India where **big data analytics** can have its reach because these are the two areas that have faced a major growth in big data: Commercial and Government. While the commercial part of India is largely focusing on the volume of big data or the aspect that is often related to when it comes to **big data analytics,** the government part of India on the other hand is focusing on the mining of unstructured data, the main constituent of big data which is for refining, for the fulfillment of data gaps. The real purpose of **big data analytics** is combining the structured and unstructured data and making the inference between them in real time. The firms that are currently present in India are yet to merge them in the most appropriate fashion. However, the efforts are going on in full length in order to make this happen. For a country like India, where the good and timely data are not much available in abundance in a panel structure, **big data analytics** have really proven and will continue to prove to be helpful. **Big data analytics**, for example, can be used for developing infrastructure, generation of employment, in tracking public service projects and other such stuff real quick.

Now, not just in the commercial sectors but there are also some other areas where **data science** is making revolutions silently and that is in the government areas. One of the major issues that is associated with the government is tracking of the projects in regular intervals for public health along with the monitoring of direct transfer of money as and when required to the poor people. This is where the **importance of data science** is as the government is putting in efforts to deal with these burning issues. **Big data analytics** can be used for checking the progress in the projects designed for the welfare of the society by analysing the satellite picture obtained to find out the truth. Also, tracking of the mobile phones and mapping the usage of them across the different districts will make it easier for figuring out the details of the benefit of the transfer. This mobile phone usage tracking is useful because this data is unstructured and therefore of major use for the government projects. Now, we shed some light on the commercial part of India. The **data science** applications are mainly found in banking sectors, finance departments and also **data science in e-commerce** has also shown a major progress. These sectors have realised the **importance of data science** as it is the only way to handle the humongous amount of data. The big companies such as Flipkart, Amazon have acknowledged the importance of **data science in e-commerce** and have utilised this technology. In this way, **data science technology** is emerging as the most sought after technology.

# Making revolutions in Bangalore

Slowly and steadily, Bangalore has shown its growth when it comes to technologies and the latest trends related to it and **data science** is no exception. This city has managed to become the IT centre first and then **data science** hub of India eventually. From the various startups to the already established **data science** companies opening their shops or having their outlets in Bangalore, the city has proved to be the home of various companies of IT industries. Given the fact that this whole thing of **data science** is relatively new and **data science and analytics** is at a very formative stage, startups are doing pretty great. Most of these startups are based on services so keeping that in mind, they are really doing a good job. However, if the companies are to be considered, they are a bit advanced and the lack of talent or expertise in this field is quite notable. There is definitely a lack of qualified people with appropriate skills in **data science** as the field covers a lot of areas. This is where the importance of a **data science course** comes in as to **learn data science,** you definitely need to do a **data science course**. There are many **data science programs** available in India and just enrolling yourself in one of them would be the first step towards the path to **learn data science**. Now, coming back, as IT firms were already present in Bangalore, this has definitely contributed to the influence of **data science** in the city. Also, the presence of different institutions that have worked as **learning sources**, has been responsible for this change because the fresh talent is what might have had an influence. One such institution is **Great Learning.** The **data science courses** in **Great Learning** have really gained popularity over time as the students who have been there have praised these **data science courses** a lot.

Additionally, after I learnt Python, I made a few small projects but nothing huge. Now I'm trying to apply Power BI to make a few reports (for learning experience, since I'm already good with Excel I thought - fuck it - it's basically the same thing - so far so good).

How should I approach making a portfolio, so I can get hired for a more technical job in the future?

Besides Excel, I know SQL and learning basic BI tools like Power BI and Tableau, I'm also quite good with Python. But I'm just a beginner with ML and I have a business background, so I think I can't get hired for an ML job (full on data science) - I assume I'll have to go through a SQL data analyst job. But then, I don't know if I'll get hired for such with just Excel experience - doesn't matter that I'm pretty damn good in Excel/VBA - I don't think my hundreds of lines of code in VBA will impress anyone.

Should I just forget about showing off my Excel projects and instead focus on making something cool in Python?

My long term goal is eventually getting a job with ML, I also like data visualization a lot. I'm not very interested in pure software engineering (nor data engineering), I enjoy finding insights in data, making decisions, having to make my own tools to solve problems, so I think Data Science or Business Intelligence are good final destinations (maybe later move to management).","How would you approach making a portfolio for a data analyst job (= SQL, Excel, PowerBI ...)?",1600359844

the question seems a bit moot, but I'm actually looking for 3 specific characteristics:

1. Needs to interface with AWS Athena
2. I need to be able to run customized queries using (presto) SQL and make visualizations based on those.
3. Dashboards should have permissions so I can decide which users can or cannot see them.

Regarding point #2, I'll go a bit more in detail: I'm currently performing little data transformation in my ETL process, as I handle the T part at a later stage, during data retrieval.

Therefore, a simple drag and drop interface is not enough for me, I need to be able to run custom queries in order to filter out specific data that I don't want or need, or transform it in a way that is readable.

E.G: since I'm using AWS Athena, and my data is stored in parquet format, some columns contain semi-structured data, such as maps or arrays of variable length. Therefore, I need to be able to use Presto SQL to parse such data and transform it so that I can visualize it.

I'm currently using Redash, but sadly it doesn't support user permission on dashboard, which means that any user that has access to a specific data source can see all dashboards that connect to that data source.

Advice?","Looking for BI platform to share customized, private dashboards to different clients. What do you suggest?",1600354228

In the past few years, we have witnessed a constant and major growth in the production of data. Therefore, it would not be wrong to say that data rules our world today. The amount of data that is being produced on a daily basis is beyond anyone’s imagination all because of the growth of social media, smartphones, and the internet of things or IoT. Now, the question that arises is how are we going to handle such data? Or, what are we going to make of it? The answer is data science. To put it simply, data science technology is the amalgamation of mathematics, statistics, data analysis and machine learning which uses advanced algorithms and scientific methods in order to get meaningful information and insights from a large dataset both in the form of structured and unstructured data. With the invention of concepts like big data and machine learning, data science technology has now become an integral part of various industries like business, healthcare, finance, education, and so on. Since, data science has made its way everywhere in the world, it is only natural that data science jobs will also be in high demand. Big data engineers, data scientists and machine learning engineers are often regarded as the most sought after data science jobs or jobs, in general, in today’s world. Data science jobs are experiencing a massive surge all across the globe and India is no exception. The scope for data science technology and the need for the IT professionals to upgrade their skills is also increasing. So, without further ado, let us see how data science is having an impact and how data science technology is making a revolution in the job sectors of India.

# Scope Of Data Science in Future

Saying that data science has brought about the fourth industrial revolution in the world would not be wrong. There have been major revolutions that have transformed the face of the industries around the world. Top tech companies and many startups in India have been hiring well-trained data science experts. Data scientist responsibilities are that of taking solution based decisions and for business initiatives. So, it is very clear that the future of data science in India is indeed very positive. Data science technology has caused rapid growth in industries and minimised the losses previously suffered. This has led to the increase in the demand for data scientist jobs and thus, have a good data science career.

Major companies have shifted their base from the same old traditional development to the new and advanced data science technology. In order to handle data scientist responsibilities, you must be efficient in certain fields like mathematics, statistics and computer science to name a few. Now, to learn data science is not an easy job and because data science training is relatively new and difficult, the number of data scientists are less in number which leads to thousands of job vacancies in India. Although India is only second, right behind the United States of America, when it comes to offering data science jobs, the data science technology field is a relatively new one and there are only a few people with the right expertise in this subject. The future of data science looks very promising because the applications of data science are way too many. Starting from the organisations in banking to healthcare to biotechnology to pharmaceuticals to automobile industry to data science in e-commerce, the revolutions are happening everywhere. When it comes to the cities making data science technology their ground for the growth of the IT industry, Bengaluru is recorded to have the highest number of data science and analytics jobs which is almost 27% of the total jobs closely followed by Delhi and Mumbai. The lack of supply in data scientist jobs or candidates with appropriate skills has led to rise in need of these data science jobs. So, the companies that want to maximize their profits, analyse the customer needs and make their companies better are desperately looking for data scientists or data science experts in general. The data science training programs are efficient but difficult as expertise in not just few but many areas is required which becomes a difficult task for many.

# Payscale for Data Scientists

As stated earlier, there is a notable amount of gap between the demand and supply of data scientists in India which is contributed by the lack of data scientists or qualities and increase in data scientist jobs in the industries in India. Moreover, this has resulted in a steep increase in the salary of data scientists. Data scientist jobs, reportedly, offer more salary as compared to its contemporary IT jobs. A data scientist in India, on an average, earns about ₹650,000 per annum which is much higher than the average software engineers who earn approximately ₹450,000 per annum. This is an average estimate but with experience in the industry, the payscale also increases. For example, a professional with an experience of 5 years might earn upto 15lakhs per annum and a person with 10 years of experience might earn upto 20lakhs per annum. Therefore, the data science career is very lucrative and the future of data science is definitely a bright one when it comes to salaries.

# Replacing Traditional Ways

Conventional IT jobs such as software development, testing, IT administrators, database managers, engineers have been dominating over the technology industry for decades now. However with the introduction of data science programs, the focus of this industry has shifted towards discovering new areas of applications of data science such as artificial intelligence and advancement in automation and thus reducing the human efforts and relying more on the machines. The data science jobs tend to replace the existing traditional IT jobs or at least their way of working. This has led to the working professionals upgrading their own skills and learning data science in order to keep pace with the growth of the industry. In order to keep themselves updated and meet the needs and demands of the technology industry, the employees are required to be well aware of data science technology and be well versed with all the latest data science programs that are happening across the globe. Not just the data scientists but there are other areas related to data science for job roles such as data architects, big data engineers and managers, data science and analytics that also promise to facilitate a fruitful data science career. If there is this much of demand just for data scientist jobs then the demand for all the above mentioned jobs combined is beyond imagination. So, making yourself acquainted with the data science programs in this era has become very important even if you are just a job aspirant as the demand for data science jobs is more than ever. In this situation, [**data science courses**](https://www.greatlearning.in/pg-program-dsba) are what help the most as those are the only way to learn data science and keep yourself updated with the latest trends. There is an online institution that offers the best data science courses that there is in India and that is Great Learning. Great Learning online courses are very efficient. Therefore, in India, the data science career can be thought of as a new milestone or a new direction in the technology industry for people to have long term benefits. It is very clear that the future of data science is very promising.

# Taking advantage of the Scope of Data Science

According to several surveys conducted by different organisations, there have been many revelations related to data science technology. One area in which there has been enough said and many points have been made is the area that focuses on adapting yourself to these changes and learning the tips or ways in which you can prepare yourself for a data science career. Some of those points are listed below.

**1. Doing internships is the right path:**

While pursuing your graduation or any other equivalent degree course, make yourself known about the internships that the IT companies offer or the entry level data science jobs. The more you involve yourself with these internships, the more experience you gain and there is really no better way to learn data science and the fields associated with it than by gaining experience while working for data science jobs. These internships also serve as platforms for networking and also for you to find mentors who will guide you for the jobs in this field.

**2. Efficiency in any programming language:**

As we have seen earlier, data science involves everything starting from mathematics to statistics to computer programming. So, it is natural that programming languages will also be an integral part of data science programs. Programming languages such as Python, R, SQL, etc. are what form the base of the technology. So, having an in-depth knowledge of at least one or more of these programming languages will be definitely advised as this will help in your data science jobs. Several data science courses facilitate the teaching of these programming languages. There are data science training programs in Great Learning which specialises in teaching Python and SQL languages through the Great Learning online courses. So, even if you are from a non programming background, signing up for these data science courses would be helpful.

**3. Need for the working professionals to up their games:**

This surge in demand for data science jobs has led to a rise in the number of both the working professionals as well as students opting for a data science career. The students or job aspirants as well as the individuals already associated with other fields are all going for data science courses be it from institutions or online sources in order to upgrade their skills. More than half of the people prefer online institutions in order to learn data science. Great Learning is an online institution which is a great platform for doing a data science course. The Great Learning online courses are really productive.

Hence, we are now well aware of the scope of data science technology and applications of data science in various fields that automatically have an impact on the future of the world as well as our careers. But we have also seen the ways in which we can make this technology a part of our lives and adapt ourselves to this change.
