books,"So I read the first 4 or 5 books when I was a teenager and I loved the overall story and plot! It had a lot of potential and I loved where it was heading, however I hated the writing style. There was way too much focus on man vs woman perspective and the supposedly strong female characters spent the majority of the time wringing their hands and pulling their braids in anger instead of actually doing anything. This actually annoyed me to the point of not continuing the series.
I also noted Brandon Sanderson joins the series later and he is one of my favourite authors.
I guess my question is, does the series get better? Do the plot and the characters develop and does the author stop writing infuriating female characters and perspective?",Should I revisit the Wheel of Time series?,1601854766

I've always been very intimidated by the horror genre but this month I told myself I will read The Shining because I've always wanted to but been too chicken to pick it up.

I also bought alongside it another 4 Stephen King books because I've always considered him as one of the most successful writers; he's one of the few I've always heard and known of, but have never read before.

I've always considered Stephen King top-notch, mainly from all the love I've seen towards his books growing up, especially in the horror/thriller genre but recently there seems to a shift and people are looking for anything other than his work, which I don't really understand. If he is one of the best in the game, what's wrong with recommending his books? 

I obviously understand that not everyone loves his style, and there may also be people who have already read most of his work, but is that it?

I guess my question is, are there other reasons why people may want to avoid King? Hope this makes sense.",Is anything wrong with Stephen King?,1601852502

""Must be a different translation"" I thought, but no, the original is in English so that doesn't make sense.  I investigated some more and found the opening paragraph of the first two Middlemarch ebooks I tried read as such:

""Who that cares a good buy to recognize the records of guy, and the way the mysterious aggregate behaves below the various experiments of Time, has not dwelt, at least in quick, on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with a few gentleness at the concept of the little woman on foot forth one morning hand-in-hand together with her still smaller brother, to move and searching for martyrdom in the u .

Out they toddled from rugged Avila, considerable-eyed and helpless-searching as two fawns, however with human hearts, already beating to a country huge idea; until domestic truth met them inside the form of uncles, and grew to become them returned from their fantastic clear up.""

Compared to (what I assume is) the real text: 

""Who that cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious mixture behaves under the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelt, at least briefly, on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with some gentleness at the thought of the little girl walking forth one morning hand-in-hand with her still smaller brother, to go and seek martyrdom in the country of the Moors? Out they toddled from rugged Avila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns, but with human hearts, already beating to a national idea; until domestic reality met them in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great resolve.""

What's going on here?  Did someone run the original through a ""thesaurus program"" and post the results to fool people?  Do other classics have the same problem?  Are people reading these bad versions thinking they read poorly because they're just old, not realizing they've been sabotaged?

If you look at the other types of books Grady Harp reviews, you can see that low effort knock offs have taken over many categories of books, such as  cooking, fitness, investing, self-help, romance novels, and children's books.

GGisland also says it was [difficult to create Japanese resources](https://imgur.com/PWps4Jq). I am language teacher. It is easy to create learning resources.

Okay, so I **know** we're in Halloween month, but I'm already thinking about Christmas, sue me.

I've been thinking about making myself a book advent calendar this year – with novels, picture books (I'm a kids' bookseller) and non-fiction books, with some goodies thrown in with the mix.

The one possible solution I've figured out would be to make a list of about 50 ISBNs and ask a friend/family member to pick randomly 24 (or 25) of them. I'd then be able to ask my colleague(s) at the bookshop to order them for me without showing me what they are, put them all in a box, close the box, and then ask someone to wrap them for me.

books,"Being raised up in a low economy place, with no direct parental focus on studying and future prospectives, I had no books in the house when growing up, so I thought they were boring and for nerds.

But after I started working at 15 and managed to get to a job 2 hours early, i decided to go to a close by book store and pick up the smallest book possible, introducing ""debt of bones"" by Terry Goodkind.

I sat and read and read, I even arrived late to the job on the same day, it hooked me, even though I barely could read English at the time, it hooked me.

I went on and read every of his books and I loved it, as a result of my encounter with that little book called the ""debt of bones"" I decided to read other works, ""The wheel of time"", ""Lord's of the rings"", The library of R.A Salvatore about the adventures of Drizzt Do'Urden and many more.

Only after reading other works, I did feel a sort of familiarity, especially ""The wheel of time"" series, it felt like I read the ""sword of truth"" series all over again for some reason.

And only recently after the passing of Terry Goodkind I saw the overwhelming negativity this author received during his life and apparently even more after his passing, people were happy he died? 

His work maybe wasn't the best, maybe it wasn't the most original or unique, but it did inspire a young mind to open it wings and traverse the world of story telling.

As a last note, while reading someone's creation called a book, you are basically walking through a museum of the author ideals and morals, but in this particular museum you are allowed to touch what you like and absorb it, in Terry's books I walked through it, I saw interesting ideas, I saw bad ideas, I saw stupid and brilliant ideas, I took whatever was relevant and left what was not, you getting mad at the author for his ideas is ludicrous, acknowledge them and pass them by, they will exist, but they don't have to exist in you.

Would love to hear your opinion on this theme.",A discussion on Terry Goodkind passing and legacy,1601810789

books,"And I'm so proud of him! He's 9, going on 29. This was his first big novel, and he flew through it. It took us a long time to convince him there are more books out there than the Diary Of A Wimpy Kid, as he loves those books, but his lexicon is too advanced for them. He read part one in a week, and then the rest of the book felt like it took two days to finish (probably a week and a half). It made me so happy to hear updates, see his progression, letting him stay up late to read, making him focus on school and not the book. It reminded me how much I depended on books growing up to be my escape. He watched the movie with his other mom, and his commentary was gold. No matter how many times I told him it wouldn't be like the book, he still had something to say every single scene. I love it. We're going to buy the next book when we can as money is tight (first book was donated to us), but if anyone has recommendations for him after the series, I would love to hear. Or even hear about your kid's first big novel!",My son just finished the Hunger Games...,1601808611
