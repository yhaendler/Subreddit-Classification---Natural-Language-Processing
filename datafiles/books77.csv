If anyone else has read this, how’d u like it? I haven’t finished it, so hopefully it won’t get bad, and it if it stays like the way it is for the rest of the book, it could possibly be my favourite Stephen King book (Beating The Stand) 
If anyone’s interested in it, it’s kind of a slow burner to start off, which isn’t really that bad as it takes its time to set up the two main characters, but once the two characters are set up, it really gets into it.","The Tommyknockers ,By Stephen King, is AMAZING!",1611100562

books,"The Witcher is very popular and the main series has been talked about often on here, but I haven’t found anything about the last book to be released which is a prequel to the main series after the short stories. 

Wow, what a train wreck. This book strictly follows Geralt and I was really looking forward to a stand alone white wolf adventure(I have the short stories at home, unread). This novel is so disjointed and the motivations of the characters were weak as were the conclusions to the plot and subplots. For example &gt;!the book starts off with his swords getting stolen, a bunch of shit happens in between and he can’t retrieve them. Yen happens to be at the auction and has someone buy them for her and then she gives them to a girl who happens to be going the same direction as Geralt and coincidently bumps into him at the end of the book. Wtf? Not having them hardly even hindered him when you think about it. Sure, he gets called out for being a Witcher with inferior blades, but then proceeds to kick everyone’s ass anyway!&lt; 

This book is an all around mess and a huge disappointment in my opinion.

books,"I'm writing this in the hope of seeing others who can relate, and who may have found a solution.

When I was a kid, I was speeding through books. I remember reading the entirety of Harry Potter in two weeks, and every time I went on a holiday, I'd have to bring three books with me at least. Then, I had a couple of years where I didn't read much, instead having taken a bigger interest in gaming. At around the age of 16 I returned to reading - initially starting off fine - but then the compulsions began.

I have no idea how or why this started. But for the past couple of years, and now at the age of 20, I just can't stop re-reading every sentence in the book several times before feeling like I can move on - and even then I have to force myself. I've googled it and seen it can be a symptom of OCD, but I have no other symptoms that would suggest the condition.

It's hard to explain exactly how it feels. I'll read a sentence, and even if I understand it intuitively at first, I'll have an intense anxiety of not having *fully* understood it, or a fear of forgetting what I read later on because it may be important. I'll start consciously thinking of what the sentence *means*, and therefore read it again, which just makes it worse by breaking the flow. In fact, the more I read it over again, the *less* I actually understand it, and I get trapped (sort of when you stare at a single word long enough, it looks like gibberish). When I'm at a really exciting part of a book, and I have been reading for an hour or more before then to ""warm up"", I do read faster and skip most of my re-reads - because I am fully immersed and can't wait to see what happens next. But still, as soon as I finish that bit, when I pick it up again I'll feel like rereading that chapter because I didn't do my compulsions initially.

This has seriously affected my reading speed. In two hours of reading, I'll only get through 10-15 pages - and I don't even have time to read every day in the first place. I'm currently reading Stormlight Archive for the first time (and loving it) but I started Way of Kings back in June, and only finished Words of Radiance at the start of this month (now reading through Edgedancer). While the positive side is that I can drag this amazing series out and really think about it and savor it, I get super frustrated at not being able to get through it faster. I wanna know what happens next! Besides, the mental energy I spend re-reading stuff is taxing and gives me a headache. It's even starting to bleed through to stuff I read on the internet and Reddit and anywhere else, at least when it's something I care about understanding.

Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to rant. I hope someone can understand. (Note for anyone who may reply, I'm going to bed soon and probably won't be able to reply until tomorrow)","I can't stop re-reading sentences over and over, and it's starting to really infuriate me",1611098978

books,"So you may know May know about Meg Cabot, who has publish 70+ books, including the princess diaries. The Heather Wells mysteries are one of her adult oriented book series, which starts of with the book ""Size 12 is not fat "". It centres on a woman called Heather who is an ex teen pop sensation, and her job at a residence hall at NYU. I thoroughly enjoyed the plots of the murder mystery side of the books, but the infuriating inner monologue of heather makes it hard to get through at some parts. 

In the first book, the reason she starts investigating, is that there are some girls who die elevator surfing. Apparently girls just don't do that short of thing.

There is constant complaining about her size, and that she isn't as skinny as she used to be, usually as she is chowing down on something sugary and sweet. In the first book,  you can actively feel the disdain she has for her boss, who ""runs 5 miles a day and only eats lettuce leaves"". She constantly makes mean comments about women she deems as skinny, as a ploy to make herself feel better about her size. In a later book in the series, she dates a man who is very attractive.  He also happens to be vegan, but the amount of disrespect she shows him is astonishing. She constantly mixes up vegetarian and vegan, makes fun of the food he brings her and the fact that he is really into physical fitness.

I haven’t picked up a book and finished it in a really long time. I love the idea of reading books all day everyday, but the thought of sitting down and actually reading brought me a lot of dread.

books,"Hey guys. Today I will be talking about Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton. You probably guessed it already, but yeah, this book is the basis for the famous Steven Spielberg film. Here we go.  


Review: This novel is an all around well-crafted book. First of all, I must commend the scientific and technical aspect of the novel. Crichton is extremely well educated in science (he went to Harvard) and clearly, his scientific prowess reflects in his novel. He is able to combine together many complex scientific subjects (genetics, paleontology, and chaos theory). These are so flawlessly melded together, and it actually makes sense. I admire Malcolm's lectures on chaos theory, and I just love how he breaks it down. It made sense to me how it all tied into the park. The pacing is very well done. It starts out a bit slow, but slowly builds up and eventually it becomes complete mayhem when the dinosaurs starts breeding. The description was very vivid, to say the least (let's just say you'll have some idea what it's like getting attacked by a dinosaur) and the action was breathtaking. It was very fast and for me and very page-turning for me. Finally, the themes and morals are also important. I kind of like to think of this as a modernized/dinosaur version of Frankenstein because in both books, humanity creates things without actually pausing and thinking about what they are doing. Thus, there is going to be a lot of mayhem, chaos, yada yada yada, and yeah, you know the drill. I liked it, and I think that this is Crichton's best novel. I am not a fan of his characterization though, but I can understand, as Crichton is a pop novelist (and a good one at that).

So when Barry goes back and prevents his daughter from being killed, we’re told by Vince that the man that sent him back is still in 2018 - “Right now, in 2018, he’s [Vince’s Boss] looking on you and and your family”.

It exists as a dead branch of memory in the neuronal structure of her brain”. 

What I’m confused about here is when the experiment was done on Barry, the Man/Scientist DIDN’T go back in time with him, but when the experiment was done on Reed, Helena (and I assume the others) DID go back in time with him - am I over thinking this, have I missed something or is this something I’ll find out soon?

The most glaring issue in my opinion is the pacing. I think I actually enjoyed the first half more than the second half just because it felt like a well-paced, connected story. I also really enjoyed all of the political discourse, which I’ve seen some people deem boring, so that helped. Towards the end, it seems like Herbert realized how much he still had to pack in and just started throwing things at us. 

My second issue is more of a personal opinion, but I was not a fan of Paul’s character development. He grew incredibly power hungry towards the end, and I suppose I understand this choice as he was the chosen one and he knew he was the only one that could save humanity or whatnot, but it didn’t really come off that way at times.

For those who have never listened to NPR’s podcast “Planet Money,” they usually discuss interesting and rarely thought about parts of the economy. However, this last Friday they spent the podcast reading The Great Gatsby in its entirety (~4 hours).

Since quarantine began I’ve read around 20 books, many classics, but none have emotionally impacted me as much as listening to Gatsby read aloud. Something about being forced to listen to it at a slower pace than I would have read it myself made me appreciate many parts I may have missed. By the time the book was finished, I was devastated. The kind of devastated a book should leave you, when it’s plot comes off the pages and the themes seem to become a new part of your own world view, and feel like a piece of your own personal life experience. 

At the end of the novel, when Henry Gatz shares Jay’s schedule he found, hidden in the back pages of a book, I was overwhelmed by how real his emotions felt. This truly will be a book I go back to again in the future.

I knew what Lolita was before I read it. I knew it was about a sick, evil man ""falling in love"" with a little girl and taking advantage of her after her mother dies. But I think going into the book with this knowledge actually made it MORE difficult to come to terms with. 

I hated Humbert. He's evil, he's deranged, and I wanted to feel happy when he died. But I couldn't. When he killed Clare Quilty and drove recklessly, covered in his blood, so detached from anything, I cried. I hate Humbert, and the book was so wonderfully written that I actually empathized with him, and I was lowkey disgusted with myself for it. I know he's the epitome of an unreliable narrator and that he spends the duration of his confession lying to himself and the reader, but I actually caught myself feeling sorry for him. He's a deranged man, destroyed by an obsession that drove him to destroy the lives of others. 

But then I realized... I was falling for Humbert's trap. That is what Humbert WANTED me to feel. He made me feel his suffering, his fear, his pain so deeply that I nearly forgot about Dolores, the real victim of the story. He destroyed her. He completely destroyed her and I was almost too blinded by Humbert's misery to see it, and yet it's plain as day. When he was killing Clare, I caught myself feeling like Humbert was a man, hopelessly in love, destroyed by that love, and he had that love torn from him and was left with nothing. Humbert wanted the reader to feel that way. 

Humbert didn't love Dolores. He loved the idea of her. He was so obsessed with his sick idea of ""nymphets"" that he completely forgot that they were just kids. He was so obsessed with Dolores, put her on such a high pedestal that he completely forgot that she was a person, a HUMAN BEING who he utterly destroyed. And I was so blinded by the tale of a man losing himself in insanity, to the point where I was crying because I FELT SORRY for this miserable sack of shit, that I too forgot for a moment that Dolores was a person, a child, and she was the one who was actually the victim in all of this. That probably sounds insane to anyone who hasn't read the book and that's because it is. Dolores lost her mother, her friends, her innocence, her WHOLE LIFE and it was old poor Humbert that I caught myself crying for.

The book ""French Armies of the Hundred Years War"" gives visual context about the evolution of the French army during the 100 years war, and how it influenced the final outcome. From the mindset focused on the conservative tactics of the chivalric world of the early period to the modern reorganized army of Charles VII, with regular troops, tried and tested tactics and firearms (handgonnes and cannons). The author explainins the evolution of tactics, arms and armor, organization and recruitment in the book's 48 pages.

The books is illustrated with coloured plates and photographs, including the only known contemporary picture of Jeanne d’Arc - the inspirationg for the illustrator Angus McBride in his color plate on her. The plates go through a logical cronological evolution:

\- Cavalry 1337-1360;  
\- Infantry 1337-1360 (including a crossbowman, a sergeant and a Northern France Militiaman);  
\- Cavalry 1360-1415 (including representations of famous knights like Boucicault, Guichard Dauphin and Bertrand du Guesclin);  
\- Infantry 1360-1415 (including a crossbowman, a militiaman and a light infantryman from Southern France);  
\- Naval Warfare 1337-1415 (Jean de Bethencourt donning his armour; a Basque sailor and a Castillan naval captain);  
\- Cavalry 1415-1453 (Jeanne D'Arc in civilian clothing; a Breton man-at-arms and a French Knight);  
\- Infantry 1415-1453 (a Franc-archer, an insurgent and a Flemish mercenary);  
\- Artillery 1430-1453 (including a gunner with ribaudequin, his assistant and a handgunner).

The French army, after suffering crippling defeats in Crècy, Poitiers and later Agincourt, would reform itself from top to bottom and form a powerful military machine. The reformation of the tax system would augment the royal income tenfold in the 1430s, and the French monarchy was able to oversaw the creation of the first standing army in Europe since the Romans. The French were also quick to adopt and efficiently organize artillery, which was used to help smash English armies at Formigny and Castillon. The English, on the other hand, fought the war on an economic shoestring and their revenues declined as the war dragged on; they often conquered land that was devastated and incapable of producing revenue for some time. Lacking the money to sustain large armies in France, the English were eventually overwhelmed.

The Hundred Years War was a defining moment in European history, where large standing armies became possible and royal authority was forced to construct more complex fiscal structures than had existed under parochial feudalism. This new age brought in the Absolutism and the strenghtening of the nation-state what would usher in the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery.",French Armies of the Hundred Years War (My Review),1611068396

Russia’s War in Afghanistan is mainly outdated but it has its value a a historical document, making for a good journalistic account. The author makes a good job in presenting both sides, especially the many different Afghan guerrilla groups. The most interesting aspect, in my opinion, is the author's prediction (the book was written in 1986) that the war would last some 20 years and that nobody ever won a war of atrittion against Russia (Soviet Union at the time but the author keeps calling it Russia); the author also concedes that the Mujahideen are tough fighters and should not be underestimated.

The book contains information on the Soviet forces, the Army of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA) and the many Mujahideen groups. The life of both sides were mainly miserable and the fighting was ruthless. The Soviets were unforgiving and used indiscriminate firepower in their search for the elusive ""Dushman"" (""Phantoms""), but they not only killed civilians as collateral damage, they completely wiped out villages to show the might of the Soviet Union in an attempt to cower the Afghan population; this ""depopulation policy"" did prevent the guerrillas from getting food and shelter in the affected regions but ultimately backfired as it hardened the anti-Soviet sentiment. The DRA was a poorly trained, poorly equipped and poorly led fighting force. It is no surprise that its morale was low and their performance in battle was mainly ineffective. The Mujahideen are a confused lot of chieftains, ex-military, civilian-turned-guerrilla and CIA-trained militants. As the author says, the Afghans receive a gun when they are considered men but, regardless of their fanfarronic claimings, their marksmanship was poor. The discipline of the Mujahideen was also very poor, as its weapons handling; but he is determined and fanatical. The descentralized command structure of the anti-Soviet forces made it difficult for both good cooperation and for the Soviets to crush the opposition. At the time of writing the Afghans badly needed anti-air weapons to deal with the Soviet airmobile tactics and the Stingers were just entering the battlefield. For a good study on the tactics used by the Soviets and Mujahideen the following books are required reading:

\- ""The Soviet-Afghan War: How a Superpower Fought and Lost"",

\-""The Bear Went Over the Mountain: Soviet Combat Tactics in Afghanistan"",

\-""The Other Side of the Mountain: Mujahideen Tactics in the Soviet-Afghan War"".

The plates in this book are as good as usual. There is a plate showing a Soviet soldier wearing an NBC suit, as the Soviets used chemical weapons against the guerrillas and the civilian population alike. In another plate, a Mujahideen is hiding a tank stolen (or bought) from the DRA. Both sides made extensive use of booby-traps, with the Soviets booby-trapped pens because illiteracy was very high in Afghanistan, making the act of wearing a pen in your pocket a sign of status - meaning you can write and read. The Soviets also booby-trapped toys... The Mujahideens bobby-trapped roads (even beneath the concrete!) and even ordinary coffe machines could be bobby-trapped by them. There is a plate based in a picture of a dead Ukrainian parachute officer, with some commentary on the diary found in his body. The photographs are also good and the author appears in one of them examining an AK rifle with a group of Mujahideen guerrillas.

Overall this book is excellent for the time when it was written. For a book showing a more scholar view of the conflict and written decades after the end of the war (with new Russian material), I recommend Osprey's ""The Soviet-Afghan War 1979-1989"" by Gregory Fremont-Barnes, published in 2012.",Russia’s War in Afghanistan (My Review),1611067908

books,"The earlier post about the Brother's Karamazov made me think of an exchange that I dimly remember. In my mind, it's the Brothers Karamazov, and it's Fyodor Karamazov talking about what a depraved person he is and, one of the insights he offers, is that he does not hate a person for what they've done to him. Rather, what causes him to hate them is what he's done to them -- his mistreatment of the person causes him self-loathing which makes him hate the person triggering that self-loathing.

Trouble is that when I've gone to look for that particular scene, I haven't been able to find it. Granted, I haven't gone back and read the book page-for-page in 10 years or more. But Googling variations on this theme doesn't seem to turn up any Dostoyevsky. Anyone know whether this actually happens in the Brothers Karamazov? Maybe some other Russian literature?

As an add on question, does anyone know why different versions of books exist for hardcover and paperback? This is something I saw for some of the Rick Riordan books (even for the newer books), where the old cover version is only available in hardcover but not paperback. Even for a book released in August 2020 (the tyrant's tomb as an example). I don't understand why they would do that if the book is not that old?
