I was always fascinated with swords, armor, castles, knights when I was child, and this infatuation has persisted into my young adulthood. I was recently in the market for a new fantasy book after finishing Rothfuss' unfinished Kingkiller Trilogy and was absolutely enamored with it.  


I googled just a generic list of 'good fantasy books' and initially was met with reservations at the title ""Assassin's Apprentice"" as it sounds like a generic fantasy novel I would have tried to conjure in middle school, but was won over by its placement on multiple lists of 'good fantasy books' and an appraisal of RR Martin stating it was ""How fantasy should be written""  


I cannot put into words how underwhelming I am by this book. I've read about 230 pages so far (of \~420) and there is absolutely nothing of interest happening, will happen, or has happened. Nothing that is supposed to intrigue stirs anything in me. I don't really care about what the Skill is, who the Fool is, what the Red Raiders are doing to people or how.

books,"I have had a thought about the Mortal Instruments series.

Are Valentine and Sebastian/Jonathan Morgenstern supposed to be some form of reference or incarnation of Lucifer?

What got me thinking about this was that the symbol on the Morgenstern ring are falling stars.  Another name for Lucifer was the Morning Star.  Lucifer fell in an effort to become as powerful as God.  Falling star.

The first person in the series to have the ring was Valentine, he gave it to Jace who gave to Clary.  Jace almost defected to Valentine's side at the end of the first book and became bound to Sebastian/Jonathan later on in the series.

Furthermore, in the most recent (that I'm aware of) covers for the series, the last book has a picture of Sebastian/Jonathan with wings that look very similar to what people perceive angel wings to look like.

Finally, book four - the book where Sebastian/Jonathan comes back to life, Jace becomes bound to him and Lilith is centered around quite heavily - is called City of Fallen Angels.

But, he only accepted Walker because Lomax said he could pass his class (eventually, Stoner grows to hate Lomax). We, see Walker's incompetence when he is questioned in front of the committee. He can't answer any questions, but the questions from Lomax. When Stoner asks him a question Lomax attempts to rephrase the question. So, Walker can answer it. 

**It's almost like I think of Lomax and Walker, as of the world.** It's Lomax that is obviously conspiring with Walker. It's Walker, that attacks Driscoll's paper. It's Lomax that is the reason why Driscoll was fired. But, we see that the intelligence of Driscoll is something that strikes a chord within Stoner.

However, all of a sudden, book #9 is in the first person and it completely threw me off.

Every Wednesday, we'll post a new country or culture for you to recommend literature from, with the caveat that it must have been written by someone from that there (i.e. Shogun by James Clavell is a great book but wouldn't be included in Japanese literature). 
               
December 10 is [Alfred Nobel Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Nobel) in Sweden and to celebrate we're discussing Swedish literature!  Please use this thread to discuss your favorite Swedish literature and authors.

books,"I love Jean Jullien's Why the Face? book. On the back it says: printed in China.

I would love to know who printed this book. I've been trying to print my book (with throw-outs) and apparently there are 2 machines in the EU that can manage to print this (in Switzerland &amp; Holland) but they ask for an unrealistic price.

books,"Hello everyone! I'm planning to get an ereader for Christmas but my budget is very limited. I got into reading 3 years ago (was 14 at that time) and I have always used my phone as a reading device ever since. I could go for hours without stopping. But for the past few months, I've experienced headaches when reading for long hours. So, I looked up some e-ink readers and Kindle seems to be the best choice for most readers but it's way out of my budget. I also searched for used ones but not many people sell it here in my country. Does anyone know any alternative for Kindle? Thanks a lot.",Cheapest Ereader for a Broke Student,1607505257
