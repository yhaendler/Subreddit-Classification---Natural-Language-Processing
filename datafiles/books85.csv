books,"Those of you who have been following my little journey...
I have been reading the Harry Potter books for the first time. I’ve been reading the remainder (about a 1/5) since 1am... it’s 5am now...
And let me say.... 

I am wrecked. 
I was loving the beginning so much... the order coming for Harry, Christmas at the headquarters, seeing Lockhart again... and Snapes memory! I loved that. 

I knew Sirius was going to die because I’d seen the film... but boy howdy, I’m still sad as hell...
I don’t cry at films or books. I just can’t. I never have. I feel like I want to. I’m absolutely dying inside. But the tears just won’t come. 
I’m devastated that Sirius was only in Harry’s life for such a short amount of time...

books,"Robin Diangelo’s “White Fragility” has a powerful message it wants to deliver: the ignorance of racism has to end. We (people of the “Western” world) should all accept the undeniable reality of being born into racism. We have no escape from it and, as such, should stop presenting ourselves as outliers of such reality. Instead, we should work on establishing a solidarity of shared suffering and keep learning throughout our lives about two major phenomena: how the history keeps shaping our lives today and what we can do about it. In words of Seneca: “As long as you live, keep learning how to live.” This book however, was not written as a way to galvanize people into action. Instead, it was shaped into a love letter to identity politics leaving the majority of its claims and criticisms baseless.

Here is a short list of such flaws: 

1. The author manipulates language to present history in a way that suits the book’s agenda thereby leaving the reader misinformed. This, most notably happens when Diangelo writes about the 1920’s amendment that granted women the rights to vote. Time and again, the author maintains “access to [voting rights] was denied to black women.” It is important to note that the right to vote has always been and will always be in a constant tug-of-war of whether it’s a right or a privilege. However, the way Diangelo presents that statement is misleading because it favors the narrative of something being denied on a constitutional level when it was not. 
2. While Diangelo has some fair points on how individualism is ineffective in combating racism, she seems to have merely chucked objectivity and meritocracy as other ideologies that are not effective in combating racism without properly corroborating those claims. Simply put, Diangelo masterfully plays her audience and knows that she runs no risk of losing credibility by presenting those “right wing ideologies” in the same light as individualism with insufficient statements to corroborate those claims. 
3. Majority of the time, the book uses anecdotal evidence to corroborate its claims and, thus, falls short with its credibility. 
4. The book over generalizes outcomes of the anecdotes and leaves out a lot of details to suit its agenda. For example, the “teacher calling someone ‘girl’ case” left me more confused than ever. It seems as if a lot of details were left out from the story for the anecdote to serve as means to corroborate the author’s viewpoint. This, however, causes the narrative to be filled with loose ends. And, the only way for those loose ends to make sense instead of becoming absurd is to tie them with a set of presupposed notions. As such, “White Fragility” is narrow in its outreach and scope.

In all, good idea. Bad execution.",White Fragility Should Have Been a Manifesto,1614488126

books,"We're all familiar with the credits scroll: a movie will even tell you who the lead actor's personal assistant was and who catered the set. TV shows have them though they're often shoved off to the side or bottom while promos play. Albums will list the names of the songwriters, tell you who played sax and who the engineer was. Video games will give you the names of the QA people, even the ones who probably got laid off as soon as the game went gold. 

But books? You get the author's name, and possibly the cover designer or artist. Maybe the editor if it's an anthology, the translator if it's a foreign work. But the regular editor, their assistants, the proofreader or the printer? Nah. 

You can't say it's a matter of not having the room to print all those names; I've seen blank pages a plenty in many printed books, and they dedicate an entire page to the copyright info, and sometimes even the typeface the book was printed in! It's not uncommon to see a book that gives you the entire history of the typeface but not say a peep about the human beings who actually brought the book to life (like the person who made the decision to use said typeface). 

Some books do print credits in the front or backmatter; usually more corporate publications. I see them in licensed tie-in materials a lot, and role-playing manuals (like D&amp;D). And yes, some authors do ""special thanks"" at the end, but that's entirely at the author's discretion and will list the editors, beta readers and the author's *dog* but not the people who did work that might have been invisible to them like the businesspeople, proofers and printers. 

Is there a cultural reason we don't credit everyone who worked on a book? A business reason? (Like we don't want staff to get poached by rival publishers?) A legal reason?

I've worked on a lot of books over the years, sometimes credited but many times not. I can't even keep track of my work as this point. It's just a baffling practice.",Why don't books have credits the way movies/TV shows/music/video games do?,1614487868

books,"I've been thinking about the editorials Baum has written that advocate for genocide of Native Americans, and a later one, justifying the Wounded Knee attack.

I'm not surprised about the fact that something bad from his past has resurfaced, but the fact that he supported actual genocide is something I found completely shocking!

These editorials made me lose any respect for Baum, the person.

I now have a question for myself, and other fans of the Oz Books (or related media). Can I separate the art from the artist? I find this to be a morally gray situation personally.

books,"My fucking god what a delicious fucking book that went above and beyond anything I could've dreamt of. This book is the fattest, juciest heartthrob I've ever read.

Don't be afraid of reading Marcel Proust! He's only talking about shit we've all experienced before! I was intimidated with the purple prose at first but then it suddenly became endearing to me because I realized that what he's talking about is just mundane shit I've experienced day to day. The feverish struggle to go to sleep, yearning for a girl, good brioche, not being able to remember a piece of music, taking a sip of a drink to feel the first hit again etc. The intimacies of daily life! Emotions I have NEVER been able to put words as beautifully as Proust did.

Even though he's ""In Search of Lost Time"", I'd argue he already FOUND that lost time, because the eye for beauty he gives you is an appreciation for the life you have. Words in a book to record that lost time. A gratefulness for the most mundane daily shit that EVERYBODY experiences. That the best parts of life is not in the big moments. It's in these small little places that Proust just perfectly and completely encapsulates. And it's quite a perfect read during a pandemic for this reason. You should give it a second chance if you've turned a page or two and got scared.

I've never truly fell in love with a book until like now. I was actually scared to finish this book because I feel like I just don't want to let go of it. I only hope to inspire other people to read it as well just to be able to experience the expansive breadth of beauty it gives you. I'm fucking devastated actually like what am I going to be doing with myself for the time being I ordered part 2 but it's not gonna ship until March 9...

books,"I finished this book last week, and I’ve been obsessively pondering the themes and hidden motivations of the characters since.

I’m curious what others think about what Uncle Julian knows to be true. I believe he has always known the murderer is Merricat, and like Constance, feels compelled to either hide or repress that knowledge, although perhaps for different reasons. I often see cited the line where he claims that his niece Merricat “died in an orphanage of neglect”, and the fact that he never directly addresses her, as evidence that he pretends or believes that she is dead. 
I am thinking also of repeated lines where Uncle Julian  mentions his papers and says of Merricat, “But she is of very little importance here.” And also of the line early in the book where Julian expresses to Constance, that if he doesn’t live to publish his own book, he hopes that his notes “are entrusted to some worthy cynic who won’t be too concerned with the truth.”

I think Uncle Julian knows and has always known that Merricat is the murderer, and in his notes he is obfuscating that fact either to protect Merricat or himself.

books,"OK, I think Jane Eyre resonated with people partially because it was a Cinderella story (she was a poor orphan who was abused by her family and later gained wealth and romantic love) but also because this was possibly the 19th century's first exposure to the rom-com story structure.

Jane is the underdog who is pitted against Blanche, who is hotter/more popular than her and who will probably wed the man she is in love with. This is the equivalent of the main character's love interest being unavailable because he's still with his hot/evil girlfriend/fiance who antagonizes the main character. Then he miraculously chooses the protagonist because of true love. Unfortunately, all rom-coms must have some contrived reason to break apart the leads when they get together. In Jane Eyre's case, instead of some overblown misunderstanding, (ie a girl throws herself at the male lead and the female protagonist walks in at the wrong moment) Edward Rochester has been holding his wife captive in his attic and she's insane and trying to murder everyone. Sure. 

Anyway, then the situation gets resolved, the protagonist maybe also rejects someone else because it's not True Love (St. John), and they get back together. Fin.",Jane Eyre has the format of a modern day rom-com,1614453143
