datascience,"Hey folks,

I'm working on a small dataset of audio wav files (about 8000 new audio files a day). There's a set of preprocessing and augmentation tasks that we perform on top of each of these audio files which in total take about 10s per audio file (we're using librosa for our audio processing tasks).   


Would like to make this applicable as a general discussion but with the following added notes

\- Assume that obtaining additional compute resources (on-premise or on the cloud) is not a problem 

\- Preprocessing must happen when all new files are collected and not as they are obtained

&amp;#x200B;

I’m talking about the likes of Siraj Raval, or worse, the nobodies at small to medium firms who fakes their way into roles and have no qualifications or backgrounds.

Example, an analyst where I work said this to me and firmly believes it, “statistics is just for making the data look good, the way you want.” When I heard that my jaw dropped. Here is a person working as a data analyst who believes all statistics is meant for it manipulating data to make it look “good.” I’ve also witnessed this analyst, in a presentation to management, display a bar chart with manipulated bins to make them rise along side another series, and then claim correlation! Also, they’ve used that word when comparing two separate pie charts! Manipulating bins to hold different ranges in this manner is surely fraud. Leaning on “correlation” for every chart you produce is just negligent.

My name is Max and in August I'll be starting my senior year of high school. For some context, I'm a pretty strong applicant and will be looking at competitive schools such as Columbia, the University of Chicago, Northwestern, USC, UCLA, and many others. 

I've been interested in computer science for many years now, and as I approach the college applications process I've been thinking about my major quite a bit. I've always had a knack for patterns and the such so while I was researching jobs and majors and I saw data science I thought, ""Well this is it!"" Great pay, expanding field, at least some upward mobility, and something I'd actually be interested in. After reading through quite a few posts on this sub it seems as if the career isn't as perfect as I previously thought lol. Just a note, it's extremely important to me that I'm financially successful post-graduation. So I have a few questions for all of you.

1. If money is my motivation, along with actual interest in data science, should I pursue a degree in this industry? Is there something else that might be more fitting? Do you think the ""Data Science"" degree is too restrictive or is it applicable to a lot of jobs?
2. I've seen a lot of talk about masters and PHDs in here, are such degrees necessary to get a strong job in this industry? Has anyone that graduated from a more selective university found it easier to get a job, maybe you were recruited or just had better access to internships? Do people work for FAANG companies right out of college or is that unheard of?
3. What is the upward mobility really like? I've just seen some salaries on Glassdoor from companies like Amazon, Netflix, eBay with senior positions reaching at most 300k. Would you all say that's the farthest it goes pretty much? Does it not really go that far?

The model uses a handful of features, and one of these features is only included in 25% of observations. However, for the observations that do have it, the feature is a very strong indicator of which class the data point should be in. 
Unfortunately because the feature gets drowned out by the null imputing for the 75% of rows that don’t have the feature, it ends up having a really low feature importance and not playing a big part in the scoring for the observations where you’d want it to play a big role.
My naive solution to this would be to train two separate models, one for observations that do have the feature and one for those that don’t.

I graduated with a linguistic degree, worked in market research for about 1 year, self-taught myself data analytics skills and have been working with data and information for 4 years. 

In my current role I manage everything relating to data in my company: find out the data sources we have, how data from different sources can be combined, how to organize data and information, how to model them so data-consumers can answer business questions themselves... This flexibility is great as it enables me to see the organization's data in a holistic way. I love what I am doing now, but I'm also confused.

1.  What can I call myself now? I was hired as a ""Data Analyst"" but I think my role is not simply that anymore. There's the term ""Analytics engineer"" coined by DBT recently, but I wonder if there is any traditional term used to describe my current scope of work.
2. All of my skills (database, analytics, programming...) are all self-taught and not very systematic. I want to go for further study to ""solidify my technical knowledge"", but still not sure what kinds of program I should search for.
3. What kind of organization and roles should I search for if I want to advance in my career?
4. Should I stick to only Data field, or these skill set can be applied elsewhere?

I know these are what I like (Both professionally and personally):

* Structuring and organizing information
* Analysis (investigate, ask questions and answer it using data). Building statistical model can be counted as a hobby but not what I'm totally into.
* Culture, social, philosophical problems
* How to apply data analytics / analytical thinking into other fields (like culture, sociology, etc...)

I'm currently using BigQuery for this project, and over the last 24 hours my sensors collected around 300mb worth of data.

For my use case, I need to be able to make charts (resampled to 30 minutes, always up to date) about metrics that each sensor collects. My naive implementation involves streaming the data from every sensor into the same table (as they all collect the same type of data), and making a query (every 30 minutes, per sensor) like:


    SELECT ts, humidity, temperature
    FROM &lt;my-only-table&gt;
    WHERE sensor_id = @sensor_id
    -- AND &lt;ts within last 24 hours&gt;

I made a python script to run this query for every sensor, and had the following issues:

- Each query was kind of slow (I think querying 300mb every single time is very inefficient)
- I racked up about $10 worth of costs on my GCP account (just making charts for each sensor _once_)

The inefficiency I've experienced in terms of performance and cost makes me believe that there's a better way. I have found the experience of streaming data into BigQuery phenominal and so I would like to keep using it, however I think there's a lot of room for improvement with how I'm consuming the data for my use case.

On top of general recommendations, I would like to know:

- Would it be a good idea for me to make a table per sensor?
- If I want to make queries to generate charts over timeframes longer than 24 hours, what should I consider?","In BigQuery, what is the recommended approach for storing time series data collected by many (thousands) of independent sensors?",1592024160

I ask this as several people burnout due to coding and generally get upgraded positions in terms of time and money.

datascience,"I will be working at a HFT firm in August out of undergrad as a data scientist and want to prepare myself by studying Time Series Analysis. The company uses python pretty unanimously and it is also my preferred language, so it would be helpful to have a textbook or some sort of resource that teaches both the theoretical fundamentals of Time Series Analysis as well as implementation using Python.

Is there anything out there like this? As far as math/stats goes, although im decent at math, i'd prefer a book that isn't too advanced. If there isn't a great resource out there, would there be a good one for R that I can use? More concerned with the theoretical steps than the programming since I can always google which libraries to use.

P.S. I took intro and intermediate level stats courses (and was a TA for intermediate stats) as well as practical Linear Algebra and probability courses.
