datascience,"AIDS! 

Okay I just wanted to make you laugh, break the ice. Hang on there, this is actually very serious. Very upsetting. And very important.

(please wait to read cited article until after you read my entire post, please) 

I see so many [articles](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/Healthday/story?id=4508672&amp;page=1) that have a lot of opinions. Written in ways, that would lead the reader to believe they are factual.  This article uses two data sets, neither related. One compares heterosexual men to homosexual men in terms of number of sex partners. The results from the study  claim to find hetero sexual men and homosexual men have similar number of sexual partners over all.. (I already question the study, not my job. I just, find that remotely hard to believe at all)

This article comes to the conclusion homosexual men are contracting HIV/AIDS because of anal sex, not number of sexual partners. 

Well I see several serious, dangerous and worrying problems with the conclusion anal sex is why new HIV/AIDS transmissions are higher among gay men. 

**IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN**

The only real way to prove this, would be to actually test people with HIV, gather data about their sexual history from 'gay group' and  data of sexual history from 'straight group' including types of sex, number of sexual partners. And that would be suffice to come to an conclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

 Am I right on this? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What is more upsetting, is that you see a small paragraph of someone who also saw flaws in the data. Its barley a mention. 

&amp;#x200B;

Misinformation is dangerous. African American females are making up a large number of the new HIV/AIDS infections in the United States. They don't have a lot allies, I am hoping maybe..

datascience,"After a month long process I GOT THE JOB!!! Found out about an hour ago, called my parents to tell them. Junior data scientist in the SFL area, 80k a year (plus benefits). 


For anyone who wants advice or to familiarize themselves with how the process was:


Step 1) saw ad on linked in, sent my CV 


Step 2) Email with a take home project, they have us a 6 GB database and we had to make a predictive model for a churn rate after 2 years. Basically we had 5 linked dataframes one with customer information (2 million observations) and then 4 other data sets with 5-15 millions observations. Had to reduce it to one data frame and filter by desired population, create stuff like age variable, account balance, number of services hired, credit score at the time they applied (trickiest one), and contract duration etc. It took about 8 hours but I googled A LOT of stuff #stackoverflow. I could've used mysql for the first part but they asked for the whole script in R or Python (I used R). I kept it simple did a Logit, a random forest and a SVM. Error rate with cross validation was about 15%, svm was the best model, baseline was 30%. Asked to make a ppt.




Step 2)  Phone interview asking about my degree and internship experience, 15 minutes told me at the end they want me to come to a face to face



Step 3) face to face interview, 30 minutes with the heads of the team I'd be in, asked why I like the industry, why this firm, where i see myself down the line, about potentially leaving, in depth questions about my undergrad degree and what I did in my internships. Afterwards they took a 15 questions multiple choice math test, (it was like the generic sat/gre math part). 



Step 4) interview with regional manager 30 minutes, more personal questions, talked a lot about the company and my role, what where my expectations, benefits, etc. At the end he took a 3 question test, one was what the angle of a triangle at 3:15 in a wall clock is, the second was why are potholes round, and another was how many cars do I think were sold in the U.S in 2019. 


Step 5) confirmation call!

I’m planning on leaving tax and switch over to programming - something related to data bases? Still trying to figure everything out.

I'm  approaching the world of Data Science and I would like to share with  you all my fist project named ""Which subreddit best fits my post?""

[https://github.com/galligiuly/reddit\_classifier](https://github.com/galligiuly/reddit_classifier)

This project comes from my masters final thesis but, this time, I've made it more ""real world"" and less academic.

The idea is to train a NLP model capable of suggesting in wich subreddit I can post my blog/post in.

I've used this [BigQuery Data Set ](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/fh-bigquery:reddit_comments?pli=1)to train the model focusing on comments and posts information.

The  final subreddits I've decided to use has been selected after a deep  analysis, searching for a large amount of data, a good ratio of  popularity during the years and a threshold of differents thematic  categories.

The model applied is a LSTM and [here](https://github.com/galligiuly/reddit_classifier/blob/master/project_testing_V2.ipynb) you can find the notebook used to test it.
