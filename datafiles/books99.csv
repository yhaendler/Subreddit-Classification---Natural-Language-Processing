I am going to be honest. I wouldn’t necessarily say I’m the biggest fan of Reagan as a president. Keep in mind, I didn’t live through his presidency so I am looking at him in 2021 as someone who is young. I really want to learn more about him in depth. I know some things like the Iran-Contra controversy and the War on drugs, but I don’t know anything deeper than things like that. I would really like to have stronger arguments one why he wasn’t the greatest president, but I would also love to admire the good things he did. I really want a neutral, unbiased biography as possible (nothing so outwardly positive, like his speech writer Peggy Noonan’s biography or Dinesh D’Souza’s biography). I understand it will be impossible to find a biography with 0% bias, but if anyone here has a fairly neutral political biography on Reagan it would be greatly appreciated!

DISCLAIMER:  I read these when I was a kid to a teen, so it's entirely possible I  missed a lot of subtleties and themes due to my young age, as I haven't  read them since.

However, I  haven't read them since because I was so disappointed with the ending.  Like, we got a conclusion to Olaf and Kit, and the story of the  Bauldelaires (to an extent, but not completely) but almost nothing is  actually answered.

We never  actually find out what the Great Unknown is, what happened to Quagmires  and Fiona after they met it, what's in the sugar bowl, the majority of  the V.F.D. storyline, etc. I understand most of this is not directly  tied to the story of the siblings and that in reality there are many  things we never find out, but I have never read a series where so much  was introduced and left unanswered, especially with the series' (cool  but ultimately annoying) gimmick of mentioning offhand what the other  characters are up to.

The only  thing I liked that was left unanswered was the kids never meeting Lemony  Snicket, because even as a kid I saw that one coming.

Anyway,  this all spawned because I was talking about One Piece to my friend and  we made a joke that the One Piece is inside the sugar bowl so we'll  never see it.

When Speaker and Pei are arguing about the Rosk war, Speaker seems to imply that the Auelons are occupying Rosk space. Pei says that there was no one living on the planet when the Auelons arrived. I understand that the gist of Speaker's critique is an anti-colonial one since the Aeulons are a key part of the GC's expansion across space, but I don't understand the specifics of this case: Is Pei incorrect that the Rosk didn't already live there?

Though reading is one of the ways I can find entertainment, I also intend to improve my reading comprehension and expand my grammar &amp; vocabulary through this activity. One thing that bothers me the most is that my obsessive-compulsive tendencies are hindering my ability to finish a book, because I can't find myself moving on from a phrase or sentence or paragraph without completely digesting the words in it especially the unfamiliar ones. 

For instance, when I come across a new word, it helps me try to understand what it means when I use context clues by re-reading the phrase. Despite feeling that I have already grasped the idea of the text, it doesn't still seem enough for me without opening a dictionary to find out the exact explanation of that word. My vocabulary is quite limited so I always use an online dictionary almost every 2-3 minutes which is becoming annoying as it is taking around 50% of my reading time. My attention can't keep up with going back and forth between a book and dictionary to the point that I would already give up reading because I felt like it's becoming a chore instead of doing it for recreation.
