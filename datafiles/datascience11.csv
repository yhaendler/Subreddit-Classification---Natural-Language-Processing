I talked with one of my friends who is also in the group and they said to just let the others in the group do it manually without telling them (none are proficient at code / have a background) and double check their results with my code.  The main concerns they brought up were:

* they need to know whats going on for next semester
* they may complain and saying that people are ""stealing"" their work (petty weird i know)
* making others look bad

I’m an accountant of two years and I decidedly hate what I do and want to pivot into a more analytical role, and am just seeking some input. I went into accounting because I ENJOY working with data. I was always fascinated with baseball statistics growing up and knew I wanted to do something with spreadsheets and numbers. When I went to school, I was accepted into the business school and was pushed towards accounting, as I was a naive 18 year old who knew that accounting involved spreadsheets but that was about it.

My question is - how possible - if at all, is it to get into data science with a background in accounting, assuming I don’t have the time or money to invest in another degree right now.

I have spent the past few months teaching myself SQL queries and database concepts on YouTube and KhanAcademy in my free time and really enjoy it. I want to find a role where I can use these.

I know the next step is to learn how to add Pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to my skillset but I am hoping I can find an entry level role before then, as I can tell it’s going to take me significant time to learn these.

To summarize my career so far in data, I'd worked in Silicon Valley/San Francisco for the past 8 years at 2 top-tier tech companies. In those last few years, I became a first-time manager in data analytics. I’d found that I really enjoyed the leadership aspects of the role - carving out an identity for the group, establishing new relationships, telling my newfound friends “no”, finding problems/opportunities, and solving them. I’d also learned that I genuinely enjoy guiding people down a path that leads to their own personal growth and success. I do not miss my time as an individual contributor at all.

Partially because of this though, I’d neglected my technical skills. Not too long ago, I would’ve considered myself pretty good at SQL and Tableau (and joke option Excel). These things alone aren’t worth shit today. I also have some serious gaps in foundational knowledge, like statistics and coding, and I know that I’ll definitely need much more than just that if I want to properly transition to data science. If you were wondering, I absolutely do feel like a fraud to have been able to get where I am now.

On the plus side, I’ve decided not to work in 2020.

I’ve scoured many of the online learning platforms including, but not limited to, Udemy, Coursera, Udacity, Codeacademy, Datacamp, etc. The sheer amount of available courses/career paths is dizzying. I’ve also done a lot of Googling and checking out various subreddits, but I feel like most of the content is geared toward those looking for entry-level positions. And lastly, this information may be somewhat important to share: I’ve moved to a city where there isn’t much of a tech presence, so there’s a good chance I will have to switch industries. It’s mostly pharma, health insurance, healthcare, some banking, Comcast, and maybe a few scattered tech startups. Hoping that the big names in my resume will be enough to turn some heads.

We would provide a data set with a set of questions regarding the identification of outliers (values of records, as well as outcomes themselves).  We would ask candidates to come to the interview prepared to speak about their analysis and any conclusions.
2. An in-interview exercise focused on SQL.  We would provide a sheet with two example tables, and would request that they walk us through how to join the tables, and filter out specific records with WHERE AND syntax.

Part 1 seems like a decent exercise and would hopefully weed out the highly motivated candidates from the less so (the more prepared you come to the interview, the more you care about getting the job?)  We'd also get to see some presentation / analysis skills.

Part 2 seems a little gimmicky.  I've been through something like this before and hated every minute of it, but there must be a reason why SQL demonstrations are so popular.

Hey,

This is my first post on reddit. I have been following it for quite some time and I finally decided to register today. I needed some advice.

I am planning to enroll in a data science course. But I am confused between these four courses. Can anyone help?

1. Mitx MicroMasters (Edx)
2. Harvard Data Science (Edx)
3. Great Learning : DSBA Program (12 month program)
4. Upgrad : Data Science ( 11 month program)

A little background about myself:

I am from an engg. background and have also completed my MBA a few years back. I am currently working as a product manager in a start-up. There a lot of opportunities in my firm to work in the field of analytics and I was hoping to switch role or if not switch, then at least better understand data to decide what to build next or how to enhance the current product offerings.

I am looking for a more application based course and I am not looking for a job change, so I am not doing these courses to my CV look good or something like that. It more from the perspective or learning new things and applying them in the current role.

The MITx course seems more theory oriented, so I am not sure if that would be helpful and the Harvard one is based on R (though I was looking to learn Python, but that's not a deal breaker).

The third course by Great Learning looks good and more application oriented. But they seem to cover a lot of things in just 11 months, and I read on a few forums that they just cover things at a basic level.

I couldn't decide which one to take. Also, the reason for looking for course is because I need some push/strict deadlines to help me complete it. So, I'll be taking up the paid version of the first two course, if I choose one of them (and not just audit it, since I might lose motivation and leave mid-way).

I chose to upsample the data in order to make the classes equal in the model training.

A good recent example was when I went to one of my professors to ask questions about a homework assignment and, instead of patiently answering them, he scoffed and said each one should have been ""obvious"". And he isn't unique. I've also had professors who were helpful, but the problem was they had to be because they did such a poor job explaining in class. Despite this, I've done well in all my classes, but it's been stressful to teach myself what I need to know over and over again.
