datascience,"&gt;The last week has seen a flurry of emails exchanged with the SHPO and DOT of a state on the East Coast that were a mix of sad, bewildering, and frustration inducing. The scandal is still unfolding in real time, so I won’t out the specific state until I hear their response (though even the district archaeologists know what state it is at this point).  
&gt;  
&gt;Below you will find why the $365k-model is useless, and then a description of why — to my reading — this happened. The second part is definitely the most important, so feel free to skip ahead.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Seeds Of The Bitter Harvest**  
&gt;  
&gt;A few years back, a DOT got visited by some Good Idea Fairies, who instructed them to create a statewide predictive model for prehistoric archaeological sites. Naturally, they ended up partnering with one of the large engineering firms who has to pay for archaeological surveys all the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;A cynical person would wonder why some company that has to pay for surveys on a regular basis would be commissioned by their regulator to provide a model on where they don’t have to survey, but I prefer to read the situation more charitably.  
&gt;  
&gt;For the measly sum of $365,900.70 of taxpayer money, this firm agreed to provide the shiniest of all shiny models, complete with a GIS overlay that SHPO/DOT could make available to archaeologists.  
&gt;  
&gt;This model would later (and as of writing, still is) be required to be utilized on most DOT projects and all large projects that require cultural resource surveys.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Delivery**  
&gt;  
&gt;After working on this model from middle of 2013 to around the new year for 2015, the contracted consultant had managed to deliver a model and 7 volumes of documentation to the DOT.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, no one seems to have read the documentation until now. The model likely spits out nonsense numbers. A very simplified discussion of why is below.  
&gt;  
&gt;The consulting company used all the unsurveyed land of this state as the negative data set.  
&gt;  
&gt;Note how known sites = 1 and unobserved background land = 0  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope this makes you say, “Wait. Isn’t that the very land we want the model to make predictions about?” Congratulations. You could have saved this state from a 1/3 of a million dollar mistake.  
&gt;  
&gt;The environmental background is not a negative data set  
&gt;  
&gt;Using the null data at all in the models (a mixture of regressions and Random Forest) is generally not appropriate anyways. And it certainly shouldn’t be used as the negative data. But even if the null portion of the data was in the independent variables instead of the dependent one, you can still wreak havoc with your models.  
&gt;  
&gt;The way they checked their work did not utilize best practices for handling data.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why didn’t the consultant’s data scientist realize they had goofed up at Step 1 before toiling away for a year and a half? It has to do with how they checked their work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Normally the gold standard is to hold back a randomly selected portion of your model. Then, once you’ve trained your model, you can see if it actually performs when given real-world data.  
&gt;  
&gt;That was not done here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, there is a reason why. It’s because the data scientist did this type of validation within each model. Unfortunately, that’s not enough. We won’t get into the technical reasons of why, but you want nested layers of validation — you want to check your work both inside the model and outside.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, having used up the entire store of data by running the models, how did the consultant check their work? Basically, they used some arcane statistical methods. And they probably should have worked. But they didn’t.  
&gt;  
&gt;They treated the known sites as a product of random sampling.  
&gt;  
&gt;We all know that even within a project area, not all land is sampled at the same rate. Just to use shovel testing (because STPs are easy to count), let’s assume you have 100 acres of land. You consider 50 acres to be “high” probability and 50 acres to be “low” probability, and you test them at different intervals — 15 meters and 30 meters are common.  
&gt;  
&gt;This means that 80% of your testing is done on the high probability land — because you can fit \~16 shovel tests on an acre at 15 meter intervals vs \~4 at 30 meters. So you need to find 80% of your sites on the high probability portion just to establish that both areas have equal probability of producing sites.  
&gt;  
&gt;So. You have a bunch of known sites. But they weren’t discovered from a random sampling of the landscape. They were found by looking where we thought we’d find them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Intuitively, most archaeologists know this. Why does it matter here? It matters because the distribution of the independent variables for the known (positive) data set was used for these arcane statistical tests. And that distribution was biased in ways the data scientist didn’t know and had no way of accounting for.  
&gt;  
&gt;See, this is kinda the reason why we hold back a last tranche of data.  
&gt;  
&gt;But wait! We haven’t hit the scandalous part yet!  
&gt;  
&gt;I could delve deeper into the modeling and why it cut some corners, but some guy making a mathematical mistake isn’t what’s the big deal. No, it’s much worse than that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The question isn’t why the model was made incorrectly — it’s why that wasn’t noticed until the last gasps of 2020, when some random person (me) happened to be reading the documentation as part of a background review of models in use at different agencies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Where was this guy’s boss?  
&gt;  
&gt;You’d think that for $365,000, you’d not throw one guy into a room alone for a couple years and then let him hand over the finished product without looking it over.  
&gt;  
&gt;There clearly was no “second set of eyes” on this project. All the way back in early 2014, in the third volume of documentation delivered to the DOT, the fatal mistake had already been made (using null data as negative data).  
&gt;  
&gt;Did this project have no oversight? You can’t even write a fiction story that’s 100+ pages without an editor. Why did a highly technical GIS-and-machine learning model not merit the gaze of someone else, either colleague or superior, before charging a DOT hundreds of thousands of dollars?  
&gt;  
&gt;Where was the DOT’s due diligence?  
&gt;  
&gt;Upon being delivered the documentation, who at the DOT was reading it? My guess is either nobody or nobody who understood it.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is pure speculation on my part, but I’d be willing to guess that the documentation was read, but not thoroughly, and not by someone who felt they knew enough about the technical side that they felt they could comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Given the basic nature of the biggest model-breaking error, anyone with an undergraduate statistics course under their belt should have been able to pick up on the problem. But as a friend pointed out, very few programs steer archaeologists into math classes, and so very few archaeologists are comfortable criticizing smart people about complex methodology.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why wasn’t this tested in the last half decade, since it’s used to guide fieldwork plans?  
&gt;  
&gt;The SHPO forwarded me a short white paper from 2017–2018 where they’d attempted to at summarize, if not evaluate, the model and real-world data.  
&gt;  
&gt;The thrust of their data suggested that they didn’t understand how to evaluate the model, and to their credit, the SHPO author and the intern paper it was an extension of, stated as such.  
&gt;  
&gt;I did manage to pull enough data out of that one paper to look at a sample of 133 reports for 2017 across three regions of that state to give us some idea, though, of the model’s predictive power. Note that the numbers below are my own calculations, since I have not seen nor been told of any quantitative attempt to evaluate the SHPO/DOT model.  
&gt;  
&gt;The sample showed that each probability tier held the following sites: Low: 11.76%, Med: 5.88%, High: 82.35%. This would lead to a naive estimate that one should expect the Low areas of these regions to contain around 11% of the sites. Most archaeologists stop here.  
&gt;  
&gt;But adjusting for the fact that the Low area is 67% of the land in these regions and was only about 39% of the land, we end up with a weighted average of Low: 34.16%, Med: 8.02%, High: 57.82%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, I didn’t adjust for anything else — like more sampling per acre of the High area — since I didn’t have that information. But note how the expected number of sites in the Low areas went from 11% to 34%, and all I did was account for the under/over representation of each probability tier in their sample.  
&gt;  
&gt;The less intense sampling per acre for the Low area vs the High area will definitely push the expected sites in unsurveyed Low area higher. Note that as you approach 67% of sites expected in the Low area, you are doing only as well as a coin flip (since 67% of the total land in those regions is Low).  
&gt;  
&gt;And how about the Medium area, huh? That’s 23% of the land by area, and only expected to contain 8% of sites based on this sample? This is a great time to point out that probability tiers shouldn’t be named things like “Medium” because it could actually end up with the lowest probability.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The TL;DR Takeaway**  
&gt;  
&gt;This wasted $365k of taxpayer money. It shows a cavalier approach to quality control at both a major company and the DOT it sold this model to. It also shows that a broken model is currently used for large, significant projects. I hope that it has never played a role in route selection for eminent domain projects.  
&gt;  
&gt;And honestly, if you want a predictive model, get something for about 3–5% of the cost of this one. Keep it simple, so you can update it and test it yourself. Complex math does not perform better than simpler math, even without the raft of quality control issues with this model.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m currently awaiting the SHPO and DOT responses, as I informed them only late last week. I should note that I do not work in this state, nor have any plans to do so in the near future. I have not been paid or otherwise compensated to lay out this critique to the DOT and SHPO. My motivation is mainly that I am professionally embarrassed by the lack of numeracy/oversight that led to this model being used to guide policy.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am available to make suggestions to and look through more of your data — within limits — for those who work within these organizations (they know who they are after my initial email was disseminated, I believe).",Lack of Hold-Out Set Leads to State Wasting $365k,1608849117

I have a (very chaotic, stationary confirmed with ADF Test) univariate time series (monthly totals, 300 historical points available ... interested in forecasting the next few future values). I took the natural logarithm of this time series in an effort to stabilize it.

Here are some visuals of this time series:

Plot and Decomposition: [https://imgur.com/a/Cj2MrFM](https://imgur.com/a/Cj2MrFM)

Spectral Periodogram: [https://imgur.com/a/hBqNk6D](https://imgur.com/a/hBqNk6D)

Since I have taken the natural logarithm of this time series, the error of a candidate forecasting model (e.g. MSE) is deceptive. That is, even if the MSE is low, the absolute difference between the forecasted value and the actual value can be quite high (e.g. predicted = 17, actual = 18 ... e17/ee18 is WAY bigger than 17/18).

Due to the properties of this time series, standard time series models like arima (different orders of arima), exponential smoothing, structural time series models, basic kalman filter, etc ... all provide poor results - both because of the chaotic nature of the time series, as well as because of the log scale (some of these models wont run on the original data, so I took the log).

I am interested in trying GARCH and harmonic regression (spectral decomposition, fourier), but I have a feeling that these wont be much better.

I have resorted to recurrent neural networks to try and improve the forecasting quality, such as Echo State Networks and LSTM networks. But I am also skeptical about their performance.

Has anyone ever dealt with this kind of problem? Or am I basically scr\*wed?

Per the interviewer, the technical interview will be as follows: ""There is no specific language knowledge required- the pseudocode part just means you will be outlining how you would approach a particular problem in code without having to worry about specific syntax of one language or another.""

How do I best prepare? Is it worth going over basic SQL/R packages and concepts, or should I focus on statistical concepts instead?

I have a (very chaotic, stationary confirmed with ADF Test) univariate time series (monthly totals, 300 historical points available ... interested in forecasting the next few future values). I took the natural logarithm of this time series in an effort to stabilize it.

Here are some visuals of this time series:

Plot and Decomposition: [https://imgur.com/a/Cj2MrFM](https://imgur.com/a/Cj2MrFM)

Spectral Periodogram: [https://imgur.com/a/hBqNk6D](https://imgur.com/a/hBqNk6D)

Since I have taken the natural logarithm of this time series, the error of a candidate forecasting model (e.g. MSE) is deceptive. That is, even if the MSE is low, the absolute difference between the forecasted value and the actual value can be quite high (e.g. predicted = 17, actual = 18 ... e17/ee18 is WAY bigger than 17/18).

Due to the properties of this time series, standard time series models like arima (different orders of arima), exponential smoothing, structural time series models, basic kalman filter, etc ... all provide poor results - both because of the chaotic nature of the time series, as well as because of the log scale (some of these models wont run on the original data, so I took the log).

I am interested in trying GARCH and harmonic regression (spectral decomposition, fourier), but I have a feeling that these wont be much better.

I have resorted to recurrent neural networks to try and improve the forecasting quality, such as Echo State Networks and LSTM networks. But I am also skeptical about their performance.

Has anyone ever dealt with this kind of problem? Or am I basically scr\*wed?

Here, the author shows how to plot decision boundaries. Decision boundaries seem to represent what the classifier (e.g. random forest) is doing in the background.

My question : how exactly is the decision boundary (the black lines) made?

From the website:

""The following plot adds the decision boundary by evaluating the classifier at evenly spaced grid points""

If you look at the first example, with the iris dataset and the knn (k nearest neighbor) classifier: i understand that if you take two variables (e.g. sepal length and sepal width), you can plot each observation from the dataset. 

From here on, i am confused. You can now take many different combinations of (sepal length, sepal wdth) and ""give "" them to the classifier.

datascience,"Something I've been thinking about recently is how, because DS covers so many areas, not every data scientist struggles with the same challenges. That is, some of us spend a lot of time optimizing one single thing to the n-degree because even a 0.1% improvement equates to millions of dollars of additional profit. Meanwhile, some of us are spending most of their time building new models from scratch that are generally terrible, but so much better than what existed that they are wortwhile (because sometimes what existed before was nothing).

Beyond that, even the types of problems we are working on lead to different sources of complexity. In some cases, the problem is very easily defined, easily understood, but very hard to solve. In other cases the problem is very hard to define - and yet, often easy to solve once you have a good problem definition.

One thing I realized is that - not having done, for example, A/B testing - I don't have a great understanding for what makes A/B testing difficult. At a 10,000 ft level it looks pretty simple - but I'm sure the devil is in the details which are easily missed by someone inexperienced in the area.

What does this process look like if you are trying to follow a principled data science workflow and organize yourself according to something like [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)? The goal is to have a reproducible workflow that is transparent, so that anyone on your team could see how you arrived at your results and do it themselves.

This process naturally involves a lot of experimentation with pipeline steps and model selection as well as hyperparameter tuning. One approach I could think of would be to do all of the experimentation with interleaved comments/discussion in a notebook say `experiments.ipynb` and then once I pin down the best pipeline configuration for my problem, reproduce the entire pipeline in a script [`model.py`](https://model.py) which trains a model from the raw data and saves it.

At first I experimented using classifiers such as decision trees and gradient boosting classifier, but my superiors insist on making a model which is similar to the one they used years ago. The model they have in mind is based on FICO model introduced in 1960, and does the following: bins columns based on WoE values, does logistic regression on the said data, and finally assigns score to each column (or range of values) used in classification by scaling regression coefficients to range 300-850.

This got me thinking, is a scorecard model introduced in 1960 really the best approach here? Apparently this method is used because it can be easily interpreted by people with no technical knowledge. But I think I may be able to persuade my superiors to use a different approach if I have enough convincing arguments. 

Also I assume the reason why logistic regression is used in such model is because its able to produce ""score"" or weight-like value for each column or variable used for training.

So here’s the thing. My company is insane with security. I mean they won’t let me build an application in python insofar as they haven’t verified that each line of code used across my dependencies (imports) will get them hacked. Paranoid, I know. 

For those in similar shoes, what was your way forward? Seems like the IT security is happy paying $30-40k to a third party to transfer the risk. Bureaucratic bs in my opinion but whatever I won’t be paying them out of pocket. I think the philosophy behind the security’s policy is as long as we can sue, go ahead. 

Anyways, now that you have an idea what I’m in, any suggestions in terms of third party providers that can assume risk for an enterprise? I’m thinking Anaconda could take our money. Anyone else? What have you guys done or do?",Enterprise Architecture—emphasis on security,1608670168

datascience,"Hello. Over the course of last 2 years, I have interviewed a lot of candidates for entry-level positions in Data Science. I observed that many of them were making the same mistakes. These were completely avoidable non-technical mistakes.  


I have written a blog post describing these mistakes and ways to avoid them in your next interview. The idea here is to make it really easy for the interviewer to hire you.  


Please give it a read and let me know what you think :)
