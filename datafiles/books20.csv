books,"So I began to read Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov and the story itself sounds really weird but I thought it will be okay and gave it a try. 


Now I am 50 pages into the story and shocked and amused at the same time. The humor is so weird but actually fits exactly mine. 

Spoiler of the first 4 pages: 
How he describes his first love in 2 pages and says where he met her and what they did but then just wraps it up in one sentence. (After they met) "" and four months later she died of typhus in Corfu"" just mentioning the sheer fact that his love died and giving it no importance whatsoever. I really laughed at this passage. 


The way Humbert describes girls is so gross and on the other hand so absurd that it is kind of funny in a weird way. I am questioning myself at the moment, do I laugh at descriptions of girls by a pedophile that are absolutely disgusting.  Am I weird? What is wrong with me?

I am looking forward to continue reading tomorrow.

books,"Hi I would like to do an amateurish review on this read. Took me 1 day and a half to get through to 2 readings of this ( cause its a damn good book).

I find this story very interesting because it gives a beautiful detailed expansion of the city life that Charles Dexter had before digging up his Great-great-great grandfathers works. Going from city life to country life, explaining the deeds of Joseph and is abhorrent and insane dealings with the prisoners he shipped in.

At first you have questions like what is he doing with prisoners? and then later on in the story you find out, and oh boy does it really hit you in the face.

Like H.P Lovecrafts previous work, he goes into depth with his descriptions like he has a postcard or movie in front of him from which he is writing and describing the scenes to the reader.

books,"Unfortunately I have had to resort to reddit in expressing my frustration about an unforeseen character, bloody Caleb. 

Please indulge me for a moment. 

How dare I think, even for a slight second, Jude would be given a little respite from all the shittiness life has thrown his way. No honestly, how dare I, especially since I‚Äôm only half way through the book? 

The author introduces Caleb, who at first glance appears ‚Äúnormal‚Äù at the dinner(whatever normal even means at this stage, I don‚Äôt know!) As a lawyer myself, I became irked when he kissed Jude without any form of consent(internally throwing all sorts of lawsuits his way). I, however let it slide, when Jude began having internal dialogue with himself as to the possibilities of finding love. Oh boy was I wrong to let my guard down.(But blame me not, because all I want is for Jude to find eternal happiness). 

Not only is Caleb abusive, he is also narcissistic, condescending, and outright a bad person. I know we‚Äôve ‚Äúseen‚Äù other bad characters like Father Gabriel Brother Luke, the Doctor(whom the author feels no inclination to give an explanation as to what transpired, resulting in his conviction. I suspect he performed illegal surgeries, deviated from the Hippocratic Oath, who knows. I digress!) etc, but Caleb is something else. This character, more so than the others, has been wholly exposed to us by the author, both through dialogue and his despicable actions and behavior. For once, Jude‚Äôs abuse is placed straight on a platter and shoved right in front of us. Though I yearned for this for his childhood trauma(for better understanding), I honestly don‚Äôt know how to handle it. It‚Äôs too much to take. I was frustrated when Father Gabriel burned Jude‚Äôs hand with his lighter, but Caleb‚Äôs disgust of Jude‚Äôs disability combined with the abuse and his irrational and nonsensical explanation as to why he loathes wheelchairs, weakness to illnesses etc, makes reading the book harder to endure. 


I‚Äôm tired, frustrated and damn near close to giving up on Jude( let‚Äôs not even get started on Jude. At first, I could understand his co-dependency issues, but when you are 40 years old, big big 40, something has got to give. You can‚Äôt be letting mans slap you around left and right).

books,"This is a rant more than anything else.


So in the last few years there was a reoccurring habit among many well established authors: Getting back to a series they finished long ago. Authors expanding their universes for cashgrabs are getting way too common. And they‚Äôre getting too common because unfortunately, they work. 

They work because we want more of that universe and its characters. And more often than not, they end up being a cheap substitute of the original. 

I can name so many authors who are doing this (but I‚Äôm not going to, I can only imagine what some people‚Äôs reactions would be.) Even some of my favorite authors are doing it and it‚Äôs frustrating because regardless if I loved x work or not, I do NOT need to know everything about their future (once we had a proper ending). I want to imagine them doing whatever I want. 


Was it a standalone suddenly having a sequel after a decade, or a trilogy having a spinoff series each book about one of the side characters of the original... or maybe the same characters just older or their descendants... the way to get back to the original work are various. 

Sometimes authors do it after none of their other books get nearly as much attention as their famous books, sometimes they don‚Äôt even try writing anything else ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs their comfort zone‚Äù and don‚Äôt want to take risks. Other times they get carried away because their series is selling so why not continue while everyone is excited about their popular work. In some rare cases, it can be genuine, I admit. Some authors have also planned from the start to expand their universe. They just didn‚Äôt go back to it after a while or after noticing that their new books aren‚Äôt selling...

What saddens me is in many cases, I want to see some of these authors writing new things and if they weren‚Äôt successful, keep trying anyway. Someone who wrote a book so beloved by many, didn‚Äôt lose their talent (not to say their not very famous work isn‚Äôt good -just didn‚Äôt get them what they want).

Now some might say don‚Äôt buy: yep, you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm not buying, especially when the spinoff is about side characters and not planned from the start (even if the author is one of favorites). 
But the thing is I do want to read their new creations! Just no the old ones (which in some cases I didn‚Äôt like in the first place!)",Spinoffs are getting out of hand!,1586023773

books,"During this quarantine, I've been devouring baseball books and decided to read The Natural, figuring it would be just the 'feel good' I needed during these tough times.  The movie, of course, is one of the most inspiring baseball tales ever, when an unknown player from the sticks, with immense natural talent, battles back from a gun shot wound to become a hero.  Oh man, how little did I apparently know of the source material!

While the book and movie versions do follow each other pretty closely, at first, i was blown away by the ending of the book being the complete opposite of the movie.  For those who dont know, and dont mind being spoiled, in the book, Roy Hobbs originally takes the bribe from the judge to throw the deciding pennant game (in the movie Roy outright rejects it), but then Roy does have a change of heart during the game, tries to win it in his last at-bat... but strikes out (no moonshot home run destroying the lights in an impressive display of fireworks, here!).  After the game, the bribe situation is revealed to the public, by the always lurking sports writer, and Roy Hobbs is left broken and disgraced.  Quite a change from the Robert Redford movie version of Roy Hobbs who becomes a legend.

The book ending really changes the whole tone of the story when i reflect back on it.  Roy's drive to be the best in the book comes off as fanatical, as opposed to an envious athlete trait of insatiable drive that is usually revered and admired in the real world and the movie.  I suppose that should have been obvious since Roy is always maddeningly pining for the Memo girl, who he deems the best, and not the more average Iris.  In the book, Roy does not end up with Iris for an iconic game of catch with their son in a field.

Anyways, i thought the book was shocking, but well worth reading.  In fact, the fact that Roy is flawed and becomes dishonored makes the book more real, and probably better, than the movie version.  Still, the balls on the movie writers to change such a huge part of the book was a gamble.  I guess they wanted a happy family movie, when the book is anything but.

I am trying to pick up reading more due to being in the apartment, my state has a stay at home order. I just finished David Donald's Lincoln Reconsidered.

I cannot recommend this collection enough. I am fascinated by the U.S Civil War. This book has really opened my eyes to how complex Lincoln was as an individual. I was struck by the fact that he is an enigma really. 

I thought the this collection of essays really did him service. To me they were unbiased, on both sides there are various interpretations and opinions of who Lincoln was and his actions. One side he is praised as the great emancipator while on the other the war was his fault for lack of a better phrase. 

Very good book. For those of you who have read it, what are your thoughts?","I just read Lincoln Reconsidered, a collection of essays regarding Abraham Lincoln and WOW!",1586005308

Wall of Storms by Ken Liu 
The world he has built, the characters, the hard decisions they chose, those mighty battlefield sequences are going to haunt me for a long time. 

I have never read a book that makes it characters to go for the most unsavory option even though it leads to greater good. 

I started diving into the skin of the characters like Ra Olu, Than Carucono, Gin Mazoti, Theca Kimo. Not to leave Luan Zya and his teachings. 

I would say that author Ken Liu has created a world to care for, I felt so much love for the action sequences, innovation and top class story telling. Fervently I started praying for Dara characters to win. 

Are there other books like Wall of storms, sort of epic fantasy, adventure, a bunch of characters to care for?

books,"recently I began to read Harry Turtledove's World War Series, I live scifi stories, moreso about aliens who can't outright kill off all humanity as seems to be common these days in stories and movies, but what I don't understand, is the weapons 'the race' use, are rarely described in detail! I like the books so far, but it bugs me, I know the weapons each human nation uses, but the weapons 'the race' use are rarely mentioned other than they are hand held automatics, what caliber are they in? how large are they? etc, is what I wanted to know, if anyone here actually has a guess or knows this, let me know, beyond that one thing bugging me, I love the book so far",Harry Turtledove's World War Series,1585998058
