books,"For me, oddly enough, it was Dante's Inferno.

I had this goofy call-center job that had a lot of downtime in evenings. I eventually installed the kindle desktop reader and bought Dante's Inferno. Would often have 10-20 minutes in between calls and realized the time flew by when I was absorbed in literature. You couldn't have phones on the floor and our internet access was pretty limited, but reading made an 8 hour shift fly by. I'd get a call and I just couldn't wait to transport back into whatever world I was immersed in.

Prior to that, I had spent probably 5 years without reading for pleasure. I recall vividly an overwhelming sense of joy when I realized what my life had been missing - and the fulfillment that books were likely going to bring me.

Anyhow, just curious as to what book lead you back into the world of reading for pleasure. Looking forward to your replies :)",What was the book that rekindled your love for reading?,1612902845

books,"- Why did they change the name from Philosopher’s Stone to Sorcerer’s Stone for the American edition? The Philosopher’s Stone is an actual historical myth that many famous alchemists really tried to find. Nicolas Flamel was also a real person (though he did not live to 600 something). This annoys me

- The Dursleys are awful, but if you opened your door one day and found an infant on your steps and you were basically forced to spend years and thousands of dollars taking care of it, you’d probably be a little miffed too

- What kind of a name is Dudley? It literally has the word “Dud” in it

- The fact that the Hogwarts acceptance letters acknowledge that Harry lives under the cupboard means that Dumbledore was aware that Harry was being abused but didn’t do anything. How did he even know in the first place where exactly Harry sleeps? I don’t think it’s ever explained. 

- I love Hagrid, but giving eleven year old Dudley a pig tail was not a nice move

- When Hagrid tells Harry he’s a wizard and Aunt Petunia reveals that she and Vernon have known, she comments that Lily went and “got herself blown up”. This marks the beginning of a franchise-long tradition of various characters making fun of Harry’s parents for being dead

- It’s disturbing knowing that Scabbers the rat on Ron’s lap is actually a thirty plus year old man

- Sometimes I imagine a childfree Harry going off on the Weasleys about how they’re irresponsible for having so many children when the world is overpopulated and they’re short on finances

- I first read the book when I was nine and thought Hermione was pronounced “Her-moin”

- I wonder if anyone ever used Quirrell as an excuse to discriminate against people who wear turbans for religious reasons? Probably

- Why does Draco even offer Harry friendship? His parents literally work for the man who killed Harry’s parents

- Snape is described as having black colored eyes. I wonder if they were actually black or just very dark brown. Probably dark brown, I’ve seen those described as black before. It’s rare for a British person to have eyes that dark though

- The plants that Snape mentions during the first class, wormwood and asphodel, are actually real plants. So is wolfsbane/monkshood 

- Snape’s name was changed to Severus Rogue for the French editions. Weird

- Neville’s last name was changed to something meaning “long balls” in the Norwegian editions. As if Longbottom weren’t a bad enough name

- During the troll scene, Hermione lies to the teachers and says that she was trying to defeat the troll herself to explain why she was in the bathroom. This leads McGonagall to deduct house points. Why didn’t she just say that she was using the bathroom? That makes more sense and also wouldn’t result in point deduction

- Harry and Ron literally just saved Hermione’s life. Why are points being DEDUCTED?!

- After Snape gets bitten by Fluffy, he goes to Filch to help him bandage his leg. Why can’t he do this himself?

- Hermione sets Snape on fire and receives no punishment. Later the kids are caught walking after hours and get sent to the potentially deadly Forbidden Forest. Inconsistent punishments.

- Dumbledore attends the next Quidditch match in order to make sure no one tries to kill Harry again. Ok, but why aren’t you trying to find out who’s behind it?

- The internet would’ve been really helpful in the search for who Flamel is

- Why are eleven year olds sent to the dangerous forest when there is something killing unicorns? Not only that, but two of them aren’t even with Hagrid the whole time but instead only with a dog as a guardian

- What’s the point of having all those obstacles to protect the stone? Wouldn’t it be just as safe in Dumbledore’s office?

- During the chess scene, Ron falls about four feet. He shouldn’t have been knocked unconscious unless he hit his head

- Snape’s obstacle is a logic puzzle. I wonder how many people would be able to solve it? Eleven year old Hermione could, but also many people are not very logical and I wouldn’t be surprised if many people couldn’t solve it

- The fact that Voldemort is on the back of Quirrell’s head is a pretty weird plot twist if you think about it. 

- Harry pretty much cremated Quirrell. It’s in self-defense so it’s justified, but Harry’s really rubbing his death hands all over Quirrell

- People get knocked unconscious so many times in this franchise

- Dumbledore remarks that his Every-Flavor Bean tastes like earwax. Why does he know what earwax tastes like in the first place?

- Harry’s gets rewarded in front of the whole school for cremating his teacher

- Dumbledore is kind of rude to the Slytherins when he just gives all those points to Gryffindor all the sudden","As a fan, here some of my thoughts on the Philosopher’s Stone",1612901353
books,"I just finished [*Barking Up the Wrong Tree*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31706504-barking-up-the-wrong-tree) by Eric Barker. It started promisingly enough, just over halfway through the book fell off a steep cliff - it felt more and more like a series of cobbled together blog posts summarizing what he's read in other books/heard in TED Talks and podcasts while interjecting with ""quirky"" comments. The last two chapters in particular were much longer and rambling than they needed to be. Basically, if you've read any popular self-help/productivity book in the past few years or have listened to TED Talks regularly, you already know most of this book. I thought about dropping it, but decided to skim through the rest of it

I have no problem quitting a book in the opening chapters if I'm not feeling it, but if I'm more than halfway into a book I end up just plowing through anyways. On one hand, I figure I'm already this far in, might as well finish it. But I also remind myself of the sunk cost fallacy and that time I'm wasting time I could be using for another book

books,"I'm nearly finished with the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy by Liu Cixin. I've read The Three Body Problem and The Dark Forest and I'm half way through reading Death's End. Before this I've read a lot of translated Chinese webnovels that I got introduced to through r/noveltranslations. There are obviously huge differences in quality between published, highly acclaimed, professionally translated novels and these webnovels which are translated by volunteers. That being said, these Chinese works have some similarities in the way they handle descriptions of scenes and metaphors that stand out to me as being different from the way English speaking authors write. I feel like a lot of these differences are especially pronounced when reading about female characters but it's hard to nail down and it would be irresponsible for me to make any claims about the way Chinese authors write women when I've read such a limited selection of chinese works.

Are these differences just artifacts of the translations or is the storytelling tradition and culture in China just different from what I'm used to? How much of what I'm noticing is just because I've got a small sample size of Chinese work? I want to be perfectly clear that I'm not arguing that one culture is better or worse at writing stories, just that there are differences between them.

books,"So I have ADHD and I love reading and I’ve read lots of books throughout my life. However, one thing that has always annoyed me is the fact that unless I’m hyper focused (which happens only when I have been reading for like an hour straight), I read very slowly. Reading slowly isn’t the problem per se, it’s more that when I don’t have much time to read, I don’t do much progress so the story gets interrupted at anticlimactic points which in turn makes it harder to remember when I resume the reading. Another problem is that I get carried away very frequently by my thoughts, sometimes every sentence. 

What I want to know is if someone here with ADHD has found a way to overcome these issues. I would appreciate the help A LOT, because adult life is consuming my time and thus diminishing the joy in reading :(",Reading with ADHD. Suggestions?,1612894626
books,"I hate reading. 

That’s something I’ve been telling myself for, well - my entire life. It’s not that I hate stories. In fact, I love stories. It’s the literal act of picking up a book (or tablet, but I’ll refer to things in the context of a physical book for this post), opening it, turning to a page, reading the text that’s printed on it, and digesting that text. That’s what I hate.

Now, I believe the disdain I have for the action of reading began during the early years of my education. I was never the best student (yay anxiety!). Take that aspect of things, mix it with the education system that has/had an unwavering persistence with taking an experience as transformative as reading a book and neutering said experience to the point that it felt like a soul-crushing chore, and voila! I developed a hatred for reading.  On top of that, I truly believe the book choices didn’t help. We were forced to read books that were far from stimulating for someone at the ripe age of 8. 

So, at the age of 30, I feel like I want to try and disprove this lie that I’ve been telling myself for decades. I want to rewire my belief system. I want to learn to love the act of reading. I feel like I’m missing out on so many incredibly stories, as well as opportunities to improve on how I digest and visualize the written word. 

However, here’s the issue: I have absolutely no idea where to start. There are millions of books, all with varying themes and degrees of difficulty, and I get overwhelmed with the thought of trying to find some to start with.

books,"At the risk of sounding utterly pedantic:

Reading War and Peace has satiated a deep hunger in me that has panged me for so long. Growing up I loved RPGs and deep stories with an entire roster of fascinating characters to note and keep track of. Games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, Fallout, Planescape, and Baldur's Gate would fill my proverbial stomach with the most delightful of tastes: philosophy, war, loyalty, legacy, morality.

A big reason I've fallen away from video games is that I feel the higher the budget the less we likely we get these kinds of experiences. Today's games - and especially RPGs - are for wish fulfillment, not stating something important. The past decade I've solely read non-fiction works, far more interested in the mechanisms of this world than the ones of fantasy, yet all this time I've craved deep stories like those of my youth where I had to get out a notebook to make sense of the characters and world. As I read War and Peace, for the first time in the longest of time I feel full. Going through a story that makes me question my very being and every chapter makes me lick my fingers, as if finishing off a delightful meal.

War and Peace has single-handedly reignited a love for literature and reading fiction again. I'm thinking of reading Crime and Punishment after. Reading Tolstoy has helped me accept how much I've grown out of video games.

Spoilers Throughout:

Throughout the book, the Judge is constantly pontificating about the nature of man.  While all of them are as evil as a person can get, it is the Judge who rises above all of them.  Or at least, thinks he does.  So he goes around justifying the evil they do by saying that is the way of men.  That it always was, and always will be.  That the ultimate game is to push one’s own will against another.

Enter the kid whom we never explicitly see do any of these horrible things.  By the end, he meets the Judge again who reminds him that just as war/violence precedes man, so does destiny.  Why else would he be there that night?  And so their ideals clash.  The Judge who is, for all intents and purposes, the master of his own destiny; no matter how vile.  And the Kid (now the Man) who has been going through life living in the moment, going wherever events take him.  

I believe that just like how we never saw the “Kid” do anything horrific (which I’m inclined to believe he participated in but regrets), we again do not see him rape and murder the missing girl in that outhouse.  The Judge had won and got what he wanted.  Imposed his will on the Kid, who will become like the Judge.  Finally forging his own path in life, however evil and vile that path is.

books,"Upon recently finishing Jeanine Cummins’ “American Dirt,” I finally had some time to reflect upon this book. I believe, there are two thing worth talking about regarding this book: the novel itself and the controversy.

First, the book. There is not much to say about the story. Nor is there much to say about the prose. The book is mediocrity in its purest form. It is probably not a widely held view, but I argue that immigration stories of these kind (violence escape stories) are a part of an over saturated market due to the public being desensitized by the media. Thus, its ability to grasp interest is low and the author has to work twice as hard to produce anything of above average quality. In other words, turning something generic into something exceptional would require a lot of effort from the author. And, Jeanine Cummins seems to not have put enough into “American Dirt.” As a result, “American Dirt” is comparable to the movies Netflix puts out all too often: the ones that are just good enough to watch, but not good enough to be remembered. 

Second, the controversy. I believe the shortcomings of this book are not due to the author’s race, but due to author’s level of competence. After all, it is a part of creative writing process to be able to convey someone else’s (or your own) life experience better than reality itself. As my favorite art critic, Susan Sontag, puts it: “That art is not separate from life but its highest form; that metaphor [...] could make reality visible to those who could not see it for themselves.“ In other words, art is not a mere copy of reality; rather, art is an imitation of reality. And, being able to portray reality in a way that would illicit an emotional response from the reader is among the highest forms of artistic expression. One, in which Cummins not only arguably did not excel at in “American Dirt,” but also one in which she did not completely fail. After all, as much as I did not enjoy “American Dirt,” it was highly successful in making people aware of some aspects of illegal immigration which they might have ignored before reading this book. Hence, the book partially succeeded in making some aspects (e.g. not all illegal immigration is done by criminals) of reality visible to those who could not see it for themselves. Thus, the book has some redeeming qualities that have influenced its success. And, criticizing the book based on the color of author’s skin is nothing more than baseless complaints made by the masses envious of its success. After all, the book would not have amassed such controversy if it was not for the number of copies sold worldwide.",“American Dirt:” The Novel and Its Controversy,1612885080

books,"Warning: some spoilers and a rant ahead.

Seems a lot of people read this book at a young age and thus they don't really have a lot of critical thinking capability or something? So they say ""what a great book"" and it becomes part of the canon of books they liked, and so it gets taught in schools etc. However, I'm an adult so my first impression upon reading the book is: this makes no real sense. Sorry to sound disappointed, but I've got to teach this book now and I can't help but think, why did this get assigned when its central allegory is untenable? It might be decent for a 5th grader, but barely.

I get that its dystopia-lite. I get that no one thinks a dystopia where no one has any real feelings or sense of real at all (no love, no color, no… pizza? Who knows…) is good. So, like, let's teach people to have better funerals?  I get that we’re supposed to realize that it’s better to have feels and know what’s real rather than live in a sterilized world. I get that. However, just a trite theme doesn't make it a good book.

There's a lot of dystopian books in the world so that in itself doesn't make it a good book in and of itself even if the themes are timeless. What bothers me is a series of doubts I had. I just don't see it as a coherent world that could be possible. It's like if a functionally literate eighth grader tried to write a novel and they just go with what they think is a profound theme but gloss over the actual function of the world by not explaining or justifying whatever doesn't add up so they can say, ""but, dude, it's like... they're cruel and they don't know it!"" But how is that possible? There is no coherence. 

Indeed, how is it even possible to stop people from knowing what goes on in their world if everything is videotaped and/or available for viewing in the hall of records or whatever? I mean, Lowry didn't need to tell us that, but she did. So... all of the information and stuff *is* available. It doesn't add up. I mean, Lowrey could have just built this world better so the videos are not available in the hall of records and problem solved. Who is doing the videotaping? Where are the servers? etc. There is just so much hand waving in this book I don't even know where to start.

Next example, why does the society need to have colors taken away? Like, just simply...why? How does that help euthanize bad emotions? And if they don't have memories, how do they survive as a human? The book mentions that they'll remember if they skinned a knee. So... there is pain. And there is some memory. And planes frighten people. So there's even bad emotion though its frowned on or whatever. But... no one ever falls off their bike and gets their foot caught in the chain and has to go to the hospital because they've mangled their foot and they're bleeding to death? Accidents never happen, ever? How can that be? It's impossilble that no one ever remembers ever having some kind of extreme pain or witnessing it. Impossible. A tree never falls over on someone's head? Or, if it's wiped, then we have to be told it's wiped by pill or something plausible. Instead, its haphazardly thought out as far as I can tell.

And...why don't they have hills? Is Lois saying that in order to have a neutered emotionless society (so that they can engineer population control) that ... you have to bulldoze hills so you can live on flat ground? Wha? The world-building here is poor because the details of the world make no sense.

Second, how does all this euthanizing of bad emotions happen? It's implied that it's DNA based maybe. That's why people with a certain kind of eye can see more. Well, if that's the case then its another biologically unequal society, right? So how is that achieving justice when we have another BS chosen one type of person who is born to save the others from their pitiable state of bliss?

Anyway, if everyone is in bliss but it's fake, who cares?  Plus, if no one can ever feel a bad emotion, why do they care about using words precisely? After all, you can't hurt anyone's feelings, can you? Or-- why do they whack you with a stick if you can't obey the rules or get some words right? So... you CAN feel pain, because if you couldn't the whacking would be meaningless. If the point is that this society uses cognitive behaviorial therapy including group talk and dream analysis, and it produces a better society, what is the book saying? That BCT is bad, or that Freudian talking cures are bad? And people should be free to make messes of their lives even if that leads to famine? Why pick on modern psychology? If she wants to paint a world where that is too invasive, why is it dropped later on in the book in favor of this magic memory mumbo jumbo? 

There are hundreds of doubts I could bring up regarding how this world works. For example, if the previous Receiver was that girl Rosemary who revealed memories to the group ten years ago... so they DO know that painful memories and greater freedom exist. They obviously haven't forgotten, but they just feel... uncomfortable about it and unwilling to put two and two together?  But is this really how memories exist in the world: when someone goes to war and remembers that, if they don't pass it to someone else correctly by putting their hand on someone else's back, everyone suddenly wakes up in the morning feeling like they went to war? How is that DNA based, then?
If you set this book in some alien land, ok, then you could explain it as ""that's just the way this alien land works"", but that's not what we get here.

Burning books is one way to erase the painful past, ok, and so Farenheit 451 is on solid ground when it critiques a neutered society, but but ""everyone has a collective memory"" when the keeper of memory decides to do a suicide? Wha? How does that work, exactly? 

Meanwhile, The Giver kid Jonah can pass memories to the baby Gabriel via touch. So... it's not DNA, because all the Crispr engineering in the world can't suddenly do that. Now, if they were all robots and you couldn't access the main database at will, but a hacker could cause some data in the database to be shared with the units...ok. That might make sense. But that is not the world we have here.

A writer has to choose what details to include and which to discard. In the case of the hero Jonah, he's like a big... nothing. He has some typical hopes, some typical fears, some typical revulsion. Fit for a fifth grader. So they *do* have feelings sometimes, when it serves the writer's purpose of not making them inacessibly cold or boring, but when convenient they live in a terrible world where people can kill at will and go home smiling? Right, no. Jonah's not actually a real person to me since if he's a Receiver he should have some more insight into his own existence beyond, ""gee wiz, sometimes there is the flash of an apple"". That's it? That's the depth of his thinking on his existence? And then in one second when he gets a whiff of dead baby he's actually postulating a thesis about choice? LOL. What are they teaching in ""school"" that these kids are said to go to? It's not science since their jobs are all service economy jobs, apparently. It's not thinking, writing or reading, apparently? Or... who the hells knows. No one does, just go with it because... dude, that's the way it is in this book, so said Lois. And I like that cute baby, and dad's a killer and people should be allowed to go sledding.  Is that it? What am I missing?

I guess this book is decent for a 5th grade class because kids at that age don't have much in the way of articulation or depth of perception. But... this main character we follow is all surface. It's like Lois read 1984 and Brave New World and then garbled them all together into a fantasy book that assumes we are already know enforced groupthink exist and are bad, so no need to actually provide details. we'll just fill in the holes. 1984 is masterful because each step we see how the society works to benefit an elite and to keep others down and it's plausible and psychologically informed. This book just... assumes it works.

Plus, don't get me started about how easy it was to guess that Gabriel was going to be knocked off in the end. I said, ""that baby is doomed"" the minute I read it wasn't hitting its growth targets. So... if the father knows he has to euthanize babies, but he can break the rules whenever he wants (and everyone DOES break the rules sometimes, like with the bicycles)... so who actually enforces the rules? A loudspeaker? Who enforces what the loudspeaker says to do, if people can actually have free choice and break rules and make mistakes and feel pain...sometimes, but only when the author says its ok? Plus, why did we read about Asher being a misfit and then he just disappears? The subplots don't even develop.

Concernng the father's role, why wouldn't the father ship the baby off Elsewhere instead of being the one who is both caregiver and then cold blooded killer, so that the father's role remains innocent of his participating in euthenasia schemes? If he has any feeling at all --and he does, he saves Gabriel-- then he'd also be capable of the moral outrage he should have at being a arbitrary baby killer. But... he just doesn't. Why? Because he's been programmed that way. However, it has to be consistent and explainable, and it's not. If the father knows he's a killer, but his DNA engineering has made it so he doesn't care... so why does he care after all but only sometimes? You can't have it both ways unless you can plausibly explain how this actually really functions in a plausible world.

So... Who is behind that loudspeaker? Where is the military/police force that must be behind it all? Why are they never confronted? That's an unresolved plot there. They're the real evil here but instead we get some ""elders"" who we never really dramatically confront. So, there's no clash. Sometimes they ""tsk tsk"" about their role in all of this or smirk, which they must be conscious about to at least some small degree, but we never see any confrontation with them. Instead, the way to confront them is to remember some stuff one on one in a library with one guy while everyone else is blessedly ignorant.

Meanwhile, if The Giver has the inventory of memories, he would also have the inventory of memories of the people who engineered the society to be that way, and he'd be able to simple explain to Jonah why things work the way they do. ""Well, there was this famine"" is what is implied. But where, who, and how much? if you can go visit other settlements (like Lily does), then it would seem that the whole country, or at least county, is like this? How many bulldozers would it take to engineer that? Wouldn't there be a lot of memories that The Giver would retain of that? And if so, then the memories would be full of famines that would explain why the world justifiably was created to be the way it is, and Jonah's initial repulsion would become knowledge of the cold but necessary things humans have to do for survival. Then why would he reject it?

There's just such a gap between how this societry is said to work versus how it would have to work to actually exist that I can't buy it. Now, if the big reveal of the book is that they're all living in robot/android bodies and they are actually bytes in a Matrix world, then maybe. But that's not this book. (Actually, that would be a better book).

Finally, even the central metaphor of the book doesn't work that well. Even if we can accept that this world exists, and we can accept that some memories are off limits, and some impulses (sex) are drugged away (though if they DNA engineer bad memories and feelings away why can't they DNA engineer the sex drive? And if there are Handmaids who do the birthing, who are the selected studs? But nevermind...), then what's so wrong with euthanization? Why is the central metaphor that it's better to have the full range of human emotions versus a cold but efficient society? From a utilitarian point of view, it actually sounds good. Living happy and carefree... what's wrong with that, exactly? Sure, I could make an argument for why government regulation of human choice is bad, but the book just TELLS you the argument all at once and you're supposed to just get it because Jonah is upset he saw a murder or two. And we're supposed to just accept that ""a fuller range of choices"" is always good. Because, well, because we as readers already live in a world of color and we know that color is nice when you want to look at fields of flowers and stuff.

Well, Enlightenment values would have you postulate that each individual has rights such as the right to a full albeit messy troubled existence. But from the standpoint of human beings, it's impossible to have some feelings (like they do) and some bad experiences like they do and not therefore have the full range of knowledge of the bad things in life. We are born with inalienable rights of full consciousness, so this ""muted"" consciousness world is functionally impossible unless it's explained better. But if it were explained better then we'd be in danger of actually finding it superior and justified. What if you put your hand on the stove? Are you gonna let it burn? If you don't learn to pull it away, you're not going to survive, right? So this world is impossible the way its set up. Painful experience as a teacher is a necessary component of survival for humans, it can't be wished away when you are world-building without a full and plausible explanation for why a world of people can exist without it.

Finally, let's conclude this rant by saying that, obviously, the book is a metaphor for the horrors of abortion, right? But if it is... then the choice to abort a not-grown-yet fetus isn't a bad thing if you're a liberal. After all, life presents us with difficult choices that we need to make anyway to survive, and to be cognizant of it means having to face some things about society we'd rather not. So this moral contradiction is glossed over in the book by way of a direct one page exolanation of how ""choice"" is always good. Nevermind that the idea is not dramatized via showing not telling (the way good fiction should) but is simply handed to you. But... if you want to confront some bad choices that societies make, how is a ""colorful"" one superior to a managed one? Remember, there is some kind of military in this world because it flies over your land in an airplane. So.. someone in your society somewhere has authorized killing for your safety. Shrug. That's not ok, or it is. The criminals are euthanized too (three strikes). And yet that ensures a peaceful society. And... those things also happen in most socieities even when you don't have all of this DNA world-built nonsense in them, so how is this world worse than the one we already live in?

So, by the standards of the book... this universe they live in is not a dystopia but a real utopia even if it is built on some killing and some loss of perception (colors) and feeling (but only some, and only where convenient). Because when compared to the real world (that we should want to prefer, natch) it has all the features of the real world with just half the problems, right? It is indeed a better world and so why complain? So, some outliers have to die. How is giving people back their colorful memories of pain (as Jonah gives them by running away) gonna suddenly stop all the bad things from happening?

So, to conclude, who believes that the way the society is set up in the book is bad (and choices are taken away, and it's all about freedom of choice)? I don't see a case for it. So why does the poor boy have a cow about it when he finds out? Sure, anyone would be repulsed to find your society engages in euthanasia, but the memories necessary to justify it could also be transmitted to Jonah. So... there must have been some good reasons why the society is set up that way or no one would have gone to the trouble of setting it up that way. Either the people who did it were actually doing it for their own craven interests (bad, which is plausible) or they were actually doing it for sincere and good reasons, such as starvation plague forces them to make hard choices to ensure that life on earth goes on (so they're actually quite rational and good).

But we don't read about that, because it's a young adult novel, not something as well-thought out as Dune. If these elders who set things up are just Epicurians (the elimination of pain, measured pleasure) then why is that a bad thing just because a few people die early? After all, Epicurus would also say ""death is nothing to us"" and so why cry over it? It is what it is, society runs well on a utilitarian basis, people are generally happy even if they don't realize they exist within a muted pallette. What am I missing about this allegory that is supposed to convince me that a ""full color"" life with magical passed-on memories of trauma for everyone (via books, I guess, and real experience, because in the real world memories are not passed on via ""osmosis"") is better than what they have?

It seems it's just a YA novel that purposely plays on the ""no way, that sounds bad"" gut reaction of kids who won't look deeper into the world that's been built since this world kills babies sometimes. But the contrarian case says: yeah, let some babies and old people die. Sounds good to me if the result seems to be multitudes of happy lives. But since we know that those lives are functionally impossible according to the rules of the world that was built for us in the book, it's just not that good of a book no matter what your childhood memories of reading YA fiction tell you. Anyone able to change my mind? Sorry to have a contrarian view of a book that won medals and is taught in schools. /Rant",Can someone explain why everyone says The Giver is so great?,1612874182

I think this book is a scathing examination of the American self-image (or self-delusion) of the altruistic, hard working, charitable, do-gooder vs. The international perspective of the U.S. as a vain, boisterous, ignorant bully.

I understand this book was incredibly popular at the time of release, though I don’t see much discussion about it now. It seemed -at least to me- this book was especially poignant during the rise and reign of Donald Trump.

This is not really for personal recs but I want to make an ultimate list of books that everyone should read before they die that isn't a total cliche.

Hopefully, this doesn't get taken down, I don't mean for it to be a rec request, more like just a discussion of some books that changed you or impacted you so profoundly that you think others could benefit from reading them and how they changed you.
