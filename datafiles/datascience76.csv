datascience,"I interview data scientists at a mid-sized firm in the finance/insurance sector. I have seen plenty of resumes, all of them look stellar and hits all of the key buzzwords. But during interviews, I often get the sense that there's a lack of genuine understanding of the concepts beyond the surface level talking points. For example, many candidates get tripped up by one of more of these:

1. If I have a categorical feature (say, state or county), what's the difference between label-encoding and one-hot-encoding it? Why might we *not* want to label-encode? ([Reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/categorical-encoding-using-label-encoding-and-one-hot-encoder-911ef77fb5bd))
2. Why might the default feature-importance plot in XGBoost be misleading? What are some other options you have? ([Reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/be-careful-when-interpreting-your-features-importance-in-xgboost-6e16132588e7))
3. Why do we use logloss as the objective function for classification models? What does it penalize? Why is it ""better"" than just maximizing accuracy? ([Reference](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/180116/when-is-log-loss-metric-appropriate-for-evaluating-performance-of-a-classifier))
4. How can we visualize the performance of two different models on the holdout, beyond just comparing their RMSE or accuracy? ([Reference](https://www.listendata.com/2014/08/excel-template-gain-and-lift-charts.html))

Keep in mind that this is for an experienced position, not an entry level one. I ask these questions because I think if you've truly built ML models before and understood them, then you should be able to answer these no problem. Candidates who can't answer these have a higher chance of falling for common pitfalls or mistakes, either for model building or for interpreting results.

I have had candidates be able to answer all of them easily and concisely. But most of the time, I get either a wrong answer or some long-winded non-answer, especially to 2-4. In fact I just interviewed a candidate whose resume was stacked but couldn't answer any (even slightly easier ones). So this got me wondering, are questions like these unreasonable?

3. Using significance tests - So let's say we had a new show today and I want to see the impact of the show. I compare the footfall on days without the show with the footfall on days with shows using paired t test. 
4. Creating ML models - I have so far worked on 2 projects - one with imbalanced classes binary classification and one with regression but these guys don't really care about it because it doesn't have 98% F1 score/R2 value so they don't trust the results.
5. Miscellaneous - So I am also in charge of thinking of new sources of data(like setting up sensors to count people)  and coordinating with a third party to ensure the new system is in place and captures data properly. I am also in charge of turning this company to a ""data driven"" organization.

So for each user I know what library they use, their gender, age, response to a survey on how happy they are with their library, and number of books in each of several categories they borrowed. There are about 9000 library users spread across a bit more than two hundred libraries, and somewhere between thirty and forty columns (e.g. gender, age, satisfaction with computer services available...), so not a huge dataset, but not so tiny nothing can be done either.

Now there are three complexity levels of the problem at hand:

**Problem 1**: I know there are different types of library -- some are next to a university, and most of their borrowers are students who check out course literature, some serve poorer communities with access to computers, and so on -- but these categories are a little bit fuzzy and I don't have labels for them in the data anyway.

So I'd like to use the data on what categories of book the users are checking out in order to cluster the libraries. The simplest approach would of course be to consider the data of each library along with its mean and variance of all the observations in that data, but this approach seems to waste a whole lot of information in the summarizing step that could have been useful for clustering.

Are there any better approaches to this?

**Problem 2**: Suppose I additionally have some data on each library -- its total budget, number of employees, and size of collection, say. How does the answer change if we want to use this information as well?

**Problem 3**: Suppose I additionally know which municipality each of these libraries is in. This of course unlocks an absolute ton of census data to attach to each municipality -- total population, average incomes, and so on. I figure this really doesn't make it any different from problem 2, but perhaps there are some issues with several libraries sharing the same municipality data?

datascience,"I’m currently working in a very “immature” company when it comes to all things data. I’ve been tasked with some ETL work recently that involves picking up some data and dropping it into a SQL Server dB that they’re calling a data lake. Unfortunately this is the kind of work we have to knock out before getting into more “data science-y” stuff.

I have data ingestion scripts written in Python, and I was wondering what is the best way to put these scripts on an automated schedule and monitor them? I looked into Apache Airflow, but apparently it’s not Windows-friendly.

Suppose i have 3 variables: earnings, savings, debt

I have these 3 variables recorded for 1000 people. 

1) How do you check if this data is normally distributed? For a single variable, I could use the kolmogorov-smirnov test. But how would you check if these 3 variables are jointly normally distributed?

2) Assuming that this data is normally distributed, how do you calculate the joint multivariate normal distribution of this data? For a single variable, assuming a normal distribution, i could take all the observations:

Mu = sum(xi)/n .. for all values of n

Sigma = sqrt((sum(xi-mu)^2) / n) .... for all values of n

But if there are 3 variables:

Mu vector: (mu1, mu2, mu3)

Sigma-covariance matrix: (sig11, sig12, sig13, sig21, sig22, sig23, sig31, sig32, sig33)

Is this how you would define the multivariate distribution for this example?

3) does the concept of z score still apply here? Foe a given point (x1, x2, x3) could you define a z-vector : (z1, z2, z3) and take the norm of this vector z = sqrt((z1^2 + z2^2 + z3^2)) ... and define how far this point is away from the center of the multivariate distribution, thus more likely this point is an outlier?

datascience,"Hi all,

I just graduated with my PhD in Chemical Engineering, but my research was in soft matter physics and revolved around using analytic theory, large-scale computer simulation, and machine learning to solve problems. I've published a few applied ML papers in physics and mat. sci. journals,  but I am having difficulties conveying that although my degree is in chemical engineering, I am not a chemist by any stretch of the imagination.

I did a lot of programming during my PhD (making simulations, analysis scripts, and all the ML work), but I am self-taught. So far I have had difficulties with the timed programming test-styled interviews. Should I focus on applying to places where my domain knowledge will be of more use so I can get some experience in the field? Or am I just looking at the wrong job postings? Does anyone know of companies that may be interested in someone like me? Also, are there recommendations on how I should split my time between working on projects, actually filling out applications, and practicing for the programming interview? Any recommendations on prep material would also be greatly appreciated (currently working through Cracking the Coding Interview).

I would appreciate any suggestions, recommendations, or even just hearing your own experiences. I have been going at this kind of blind since I am the first in my group to do ML work and COVID pushed my graduation a bit sooner than expected.

Thank you in advance!

I’m about to graduate and have taken up interest in data analytics/science in the past year. I currently am a teaching assistant for a modeling and simulation course in Python. I have about 3 years working in and visualizing data in Excel and R each (I am not an IT major, but my concentration involves data manipulation, visualization and interpretation).

My problem is that I would like to enter the work force instead of pursuing a masters (right now) because I would like to work on paying down my student loans. At job fairs I have heard that data science internships are usually for college juniors or those in post-grad programs. I think and internship would be both a great/fun way to get more experience in a field I’m interested in and also a way to bolster my resume.

datascience,"Coming from an Econ background, I'm under no illusions that I'm anywhere near qualified to do real ""data science"", although I've been trying to learn PowerBI/Python/SQL over the last few years to augment my degree and maybe achieve a business/data analyst flavour role when I graduate. Likely I won't land any of these but I'm trying to learn nonetheless for a transition perhaps in the future. 

I've got one semester left and have so far balked at making my degree too stats heavy. Previous to my interest in data, I've been shielding my GPA through more qualitative classes. 

I, however, have already covered in mandatory classes;
* Hypothesis theory
* Correlation analysis
* Bivariate and multiple regression analysis
* OLS
* Model specification
* Analysis of regression disturbance problems, such as autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity
* A fair bit of calculus, etc. that you encounter in microeconomics

Next semester, I'm already registered for a ""Big Data"" course, but also have the option of Applied Econometrics, studying;
* analysis of time series data with particular reference to unit root testing
* cointegration and dynamic modelling
* use of models with limited dependent variables (eg the probit model)

Bit stuck on how to proceed. One one hand, the more qualitative modules are a bit more interesting and give me a greater chance of achieving a high grade. However, econometrics is clearly more useful and I'd probably benefit from real university module rather than learning these skills from a Udemy course. 

What I'm not experienced enough to know is whether this one extra course is worthwhile to make a difference? Without advanced statistics/math/CS, will one more econometrics module even make a difference? I'm lacking any modules in applied math/statistics/etc. Or would such a module be a really good idea while I have the opportunity and could help my future prospects?

Hope my confusion is clear.",How useful is Applied Econometrics?,1610569168
