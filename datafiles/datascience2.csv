Quick intro - I've been a software developer in some capacity for close to 17 years as of today. I've specialized in php/javascript webdev since 2008 and have been operating as CTO of a small digital agency for the past 5 years. Last summer, I decided I was in need of a major career shift and have since been studying and preparing myself to work in data science after tumbling down the rabbit hole of deep learning following a read-through of François Chollet's excellent *Deep Learning with Python*.  


My plan is to position myself into a data science/AI consultant role to get started and see where the winds lead me. As a business owner for a number of years, I've come to enjoy the freedom of running my own ship so keeping that independence is important to me and as such, I am not looking to lock myself in a permanent position for an employer.   


I would like the input from other people working as contractual consultants as to the business/client side of things. Data science is a very broad and complex topic, how do you explain it to the average small business owner, to a c-suite exec or even to marketing types to get them interested in working with you and exploring what data science has to offer? How do you explain the value of using data to get business insights in simple and accessible terms? What are some interesting and easy to understand parallels you can draw from what data science is to the daily activities of a small business? How would you convince a small business owner to start collecting data and that doing so is gonna be very valuable in the future?

To author the book, I used the Leanpub platform to provide drafts of the text as I completed each chapter. To typeset the book, I used the R bookdown package by Yihui Xie to translate my markdown into a PDF format. I also used Google docs to edit drafts and check for typos. One of the reasons that I wanted to self publish the book was to explore the different marketing platforms available for promoting texts and to get hands on with some of the user acquisition tools that are commonly used in the mobile gaming industry.

datascience,"I've been getting a lot of mix opinions and advice but here's the context

I'm 23 and graduated with a Bachelors of Science majoring in Statistics at an Australian University in September 2019, I was light job hunting during the beginning of the year but started the real job hunt around June, I haven't had much luck and only had two interviews since and I've also had my Resume/CV and Covering letter looked at multiple times and practised interview questions with a relative who is a hiring manager. 

I haven't had much work experience due to personal circumstances in the past decade but I've done 2 years of volunteering, worked as a Research analyst for 3 months (unfortunately I was ghosted and the employer and hiring manager won't contact me back) and private tutoring. 

I'm not sure if I should just keep job hunting or take on a Masters of Data Science since I don't want to spend another half a year doing nothing. If so do I do Masters part time and find a job? or do full time and complete it as fast as possible? And does Masters really improve my chances of getting a job over work experience?

I'd like to hear some of your thoughts and some advice would be much appreciated since I'm getting slightly desperate. Thanks",Need some advice as a Graduate getting into the workforce,1577891518

datascience,"Firstly, Happy New Year! I'm excited to see what 2020 will bring us! 

What is r/datascience's opinion on the Data Science hype? Here are my thoughts from 2019.

I've seen a lot of young college graduates fresh from their undergraduate degrees take bootcamps or coding stints in short bursts of time and land Data Science position. Honestly, well done. That's a huge achievement!! 

However, I see too often very under-experienced Data Scientists. In certain companies, maybe this is all they need: clean a few data sets here and there, build a few models and crunch numbers. I'm going to share my short-lived experience, and what I've gathered so far. this is by NO MEANS conclusive, just an observation as of yet, and I'm very interested to hear what experienced Data Scientists have to say. 

I have a background in Bioinformatics and Mathematics, I specialized in Statistical Learning and Machine Learning where I studied gruesomely to get where I'm at in my Data Science career. I work now as a consultant, and prior to this working for a research centre in Machine Learning. I suppose I still have a relatively academic mindset. These are the things that stand out from working with fresh Data Scientists. 

Here are a list of no-nos.

1) PCA is used ONLY for dimensionality reduction and plotting. **this is not true.** 

2) Hypothesis testing? What's that? **I've met a few of Data Scientists who do not know fundamental statistics**

3) Every data scientist has heard ""no free lunch"" however ignores that, because random forest &gt; SVM &gt; logistic regression ALWAYS. **Of course, we know there's no free lunch, but my XGBoost model is superior.** 

4) When it comes to communication. It's the same thing: ETL, clean, EDA, preprocess, model. **What about your impact, utilising analogies, how your work is useful, is your problem unique? additionally, Data Science may be hot right now and people follow the buzzwords, but they sometimes don't really know what it is, be careful with communication.**

DISCLAIMER: as of now, this is what I have witnessed. I have seen MANY amazing projects and work from Data Scientists that is so simple, clever, clear and concise.
