datascience,"For a few months now, I've been having some sort of a career + future anxiety. I started with data science around 2 and a half years ago in my first year of bachelor's because I really liked data handing at the time. I loved working with messy data and I loved the feeling when I successfully visualised something. Then I learnt about Kaggle and to this day, I always do projects or analysis from there. I've even been able to build a small community of kagglers who support and lift each other.

With all that, I started applying for internships. I'd get rejected initially but I though that that's just part of the journey. I did get a lot of internships and have been able to meet a lot of people. I further moved to domains like machine learning and artificial intelligence and I've been able to get some research papers published as well. I see here, that recruiters love the candidates that can talk to non-tech people and explain their approach and results. I feel like I can do that, I love to write everything that I do as if I were explaining it to a 5 year old. I've also had the opportunity to work with researchers from all around the world.

Yet, I feel like I am not good at interviews and screenings. Or am I just aiming too high? After 2 and a half years dedicated to this field, I often get flustered with screening tasks, I am unable to help people with their doubts, it takes me ages to understand code etc. Most of the internships I have got are through connections and networking on linkedin. I just feel like I have been faking it. I'm not bragging but I have a really nice resume with good internships, good projects, research papers, but I feel like that's just a show because I really don't know stuff. Am I overreacting? Do you guys feel this? Did I choose a wrong career path? I'd rather know now when I'm 21 than later in life where changing careers might be impossible for me.

datascience,"Hello.

I'm sorry if people dislike lots of starters on this subreddit, but I don't know where else to ask. I feel very lost when it comes to statistics since many textbooks have complicated mathematical annotations (a little bit too much for ""laymen"" with basic knowledge) and are not very beginner friendly. I covered probability theory and hypothesis testing in my studies but didn't really take much from it. I also have a vague understanding of regression and classification but don't know the details.

Is there any one textbook that is free and also very good, where I can learn the most important basics for application in biotechnology/sciences in general? I'm not talking about applying statistics in Python but rather understanding the basics behind them. Basically a statistics book with few but helpful practical examples.

datascience,"Hi everyone. 

As I am involved in Tech I would like to start a discussion on the future of the no-code movement and how it will affect Data Science. (or not)

To get to the point, the whole idea is that these new platforms (both low-code and no-code) are offering simple, guided solutions to perform difficult tasks through classic drag and drop functions. 

This opens a new door or creates a new market, let's put it like that. We all know Data Scientists are expensive (and for a good reason) so bigger organizations can actually afford them and move forward in Business by taking decisions based on the insights extracted by Data Scientist. 

So far so good. 

But what happens to SMEs? 

Not all companies can afford this kind of expense, although they do know this can make a huge impact in efficiency and driving Business towards. So, many of them, they turn towards these solutions instead of a real Data Scientist. And their point of view is valid too. 

I found a bunch of both no-code and low code platforms with a simple search on Google ranging from well funded startups like Gyana, DataBread or if we actually think about, even Wordpress can be considered a no-code platform. 

So my question is, how is the job of Data Scientist going to look like having in mind that more and more processes usually attributed to experts they are now available to more and more regular users?

I'm an Italian guy and the next year I'm going to apply for my master. After thinking about it for a while, I decided I want to get into data science.

I want you to tell me what you think about the program.
Here's the courses list with brief description in case it's not clear what the course is about. Sorry if the description is not super clear by I haven't studied the subjects so I don't know neither 😅
-Stochastic processes: gaussian processes, stationary processes and markov processes, martingale
-Linear models: statistics, in particular generalized linear models and likelihood functions
-advanced statistical methods: analysis of asymptotic estimators. Lot of R. 
-bayesian statistics: the foundation of the theory itself and its laboratorial part using R (Monte Carlo methods, gibson samples, Hastings metropolis...). 
-Time series: ARMA models ecc.... R again. 
-Scientific computing: basically an advanced  numerical analysis course with a lot emphasis on linear algebra and pde using MATLAB
-Mathematical biology: ok this should be a course in which you study mathematical models of natural phenomena (such as epidemiology ecc...). Lots of pde's and matlab, again. 
-Topological data analysis: ok this is interesting. It should be something like applied algebraic topology (computational topology maybe?). 
-Tensor decomposition for big data analysis: ok really don't know what's going on here. Guess it's about advanced topics in linear algebra. The course description says there's also some software involved. 
-Data analysis and exploration: R again. This course is focuses on machine learning algorithms applied mainly in biological domain. It's also about data visualization ecc...
-Scientific programming: algorithms(trees, graphs, ecc..)in Python. Basically an excuse to study Python properly. 
-Data mining: clustering ecc...
-Machine learning
-Deep leaning

I'm also thinking about doing an internship if I have the possibility. 

As you see there's still a lot of math involved, as it's technically a master in mathematics. For me this is actually a good thing, since I don't want to waste my mathematical background.

datascience,"Hello. I am a recent Master's graduate (unfortunate time to graduate, I know) trying to land my first job as a data analyst/scientist in Germany. Since I do not have any data science related professional experience (given my relatively late decision to enter the field), all I have to vouch for my skills are the projects that I've worked on. 

My question to data scientists who are working in Germany is this: Given the structure of the German CV, should I put my projects on my CV? I do add a link to my Portfolio but I guess a lot of people reviewing the CVs at first glance do not make the effort of actually visiting the website. Hence, would it be a bad idea for me to give an overview of my projects in my CV? If no, then how should I do it? Should I just add another section (it'll probably extend the CV on to the second page)?

Moreover, is there any other advice you have (regarding cover letter, kind of projects etc.) for someone who is trying to land his first data job in Germany.

datascience,"Hi people,

I have been searching on Google for the answer but since I'm pretty new to handling this much data, I hope someone more experienced can give me some advice.

Basically I have around 300-400GB of csv up on Google Drive right now that I want to analyze. I upload it there since I don't have enough space in my laptop. 

I am currently unemployed and this is sort of a passion project only (I can't aford AWS/Azure for it) so I'm only looking for free program that can help me interact with the data. So after looking around, I'm thinking about using Spark on Google Colab to deal with it.

I have never used or learnt Spark before, so can anyone tell me if this is even possible? I see the Disk storage in Colab is 100GB something so if I merge all my cvs into a single dataframe, will that exceed Colab storage? For now I guess I just want to run some simple multivariate regressions on those data so if there's better way to do it than merging every single csv together, I would appreciate the suggestion.

datascience,"As the title states, does anyone have any experience in linking up with a mentor who can advise you to focus on A, ignore B, and learn C in regards to career path?

A bit about my situation:

I have a master's in DS and 8 months experience as a junior data scientist at a telecommunications company. Mainly work in python, pyspark, airflow, and all things AWS. I work with senior DS consultants and have learned a lot technically from them, and a little on how to present to stakeholders and explain DS to nontech folks. I finally feel settled in to the gig and am not looking to switch jobs anytime soon. 

That said, I'd like to start getting a long term view of my career path. How to navigate the corporate world? Stick at a big company or go for a startup? Stay on the engineering side or look into management? Consulting/freelancer? Since data science is so new and hard to pin down, I'm sure there is no definitive advice or direction, but at least seeing what options there are and wrestling with some of these possibilities in regards to personal values would be super useful. Plus having the external motivator and accountability never hurts. Was planning to get involved in the DS community through pycon, pydata, or maybe an open source project as a first step to finding a mentor 

My current job ticks a bunch of boxes: Learning, good coworkers, an awesome manager who shields us from the politics and allows us to do the engineering work, good salary and benefits. But may not align the most on mission and impact: selling more ads. 

Versus one of my friends who is a solo data scientist at a healthcare company. He gets a long line to do what he wants, but has to deal with a lot of politics. Most of the work is not as technical since the company does not have the data infrastructure set up to do actual DS work, but the projects he works on have huge gains for the company as well as patient health and overall care (ex: setting up a database and frontend saved his company $10M a year versus their previous manual input with paper/Excel, allowing providers to focus more on the patient instead of the paperwork) .

This is a two-parter; Let's say a food delivery service is thinking of launching a happy hour program, and wanted to gauge its success. Food delivery services are typically a 3-way marketplace, but let's say we can take the couriers out of the equation and just focus on restaurants and customers. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. How would you design an experiment to test this? 

My proposal was the following: either A/B split test on the customers, i.e. 50/50 split, with revenue, conversion and retention as the success metrics; or if network effects are a concern, use a geo testing design, were we select one or a group of treatment geos where we launch this promotion, and a set of control geos without the promotion. 

For both, set a type1 and 2 error rate, do sample size calculations for minimum lift we’d like to be able to observe, and calculate how long the experiment must be run accordingly. 

2. Assuming we go with a customer level A/B test that was only live in a set of geos, launch the happy hour promotions for 5% of restaurants, and observe a statistically significant 1% lift in revenue; how should we then estimate how much this result would scale to the rest of the company were we to bring the variant live to the entire population of users? 

I calculated it as such: 

Assuming we keep merchant launch at 5% (this is where I was unsure of), take the lift of 1.01, multiply it by all eligible users, i.e. 

(1+lift) \* N\_control \* Ratio\_namespace

datascience,"Hi all,

So for work I analyze course survey data for professors looking to potentially redesign their courses and take them from an in-person lecture based class to a fully online self-regulated learning based class. So I'm the person who is doing all the data wrangling and am doing it in R. This is my first time ever having a job or doing something like this for such a scale. Everybody else uses SPSS but I don't know how to use SPSS and I use my personal Mac for work and SPSS just does not want to work on my Mac. Besides, R is better (but I'm the only person on my team of people that knows how to use it) .... Anyways,

Right now we have a project where we are analyzing Fall 2018, Spring 2019, Fall 2019, and Spring 2020 course survey data (labeled FA18, SP19, FA19, and SP20 respectively) for four classes: a math class (MA 101), a business class (BUS 563), a computer science class (CSC 362), and a biochemistry class (BCH 231).

Within each semester, there are three surveys administered to the class uniformly across the semester-- one at the beginning (BGN), the middle (called MID), and the end (END -- really creative I know). We call these time points ""phases"". So now, for each of the four classes, I have a grand total of 12 surveys (4 semesters worth of data x 3 surveys administered total).

Let's talk about the surveys. I wish I could say each survey asks the exact same questions, but they don't. Stuff that exists in one of the MA 101 surveys might not exist in say, the BCH 231 survey and even for one particular course there are some questions that are only asked at a certain phase. This is to be expected though, however, I have a few tasks:

1. Download these course survey results (whether it's the BGN survey, MID survey, or END survey) from Qualtrics in SPSS, then bring the SPSS data into R (my boss just sends me the SPSS data hence why I worded it this way. I don't have access to Qualtrics and I don't use SPSS on my Mac since it acts all wonky). To bring in SPSS data I use the haven package which works fantastically :)
2. Clean this data. There are a lot of variables here, but these variables are literally questions with pre-defined labels. A common question we ask in any of these surveys is ""describe your interest in this subject matter before, during, or after \[depending on the phase\] of this course."" This question we just call ""Interest1"" or something. Things like that (if that makes any sense). So part of the data cleaning process involves me using the reshape package to go in and manually go through every single variable and either rename it or tell R to exclude it from the final data set. This is a very time consuming and tedious process might I add. The variables that come to mind are things like ""StudentIDNum"", ""ResponseID"", ""First Name"", ""Last Name"", ""Email Address"", ""Year in School"", ""Interest1"", etc. I also have to change missing values from -99 to N/A for each of these variables in all of this data. If someone could be as so kind to tell me how to do this that would be so wonderful :) This data is also mostly all Likert Scale data. So a lot of my data is just columns of integers between 1 and 5. Not all of it is though, but I would like it to be. Some of my data is like ""Definitely no"", ""sometimes no"", ""maybe"", ""sometimes yes"", and ""yes"". Know what I mean? I would also love to know how to convert variables with responses like this to integers between 1 and 5 please and thank you :)
3. Now once I have cleaned all my data and spit out a cleaned CSV file for each of the surveys administered for the students to take (which, might I add, don't always all have a 100% response rate -- again, to be expected though), my task is to then merge each of the three survey results into one combined data set for a given semester. From here, then I take each of these merged data sets for one semester, and put them all together so that way for a particular course, say MA 101, we have one massive combined data set that consists of a bunch of survey results across time: FA18\_BGN FA18\_MID FA18\_END SP19\_BGN SP19\_MID SP19\_END ... SP20\_BGN SP20\_MID SP20\_END. Something like that, does that make sense?
4. Now once I have one massive merged/combined data set for each of these four courses, then ultimately I have to merge all of these data sets into one super massive combined data set.

So ultimately my question is how do I do this? Do I just use the merge() function in R? This function can only take two data sets at a time though and also within this function there is the ""by ="" parameter which, to my best understanding, tells R by what variables do you want to merge by? I was doing by intersect(dataset 1, dataset 2) but apparently that's not what my boss wants. He wants literally all of it merged together whether someone responded to all three surveys in a given course or only did just one. And also because there isn't really likely an overlap between students across semesters for a given course or any of the other classes (save maybe for the MA 101 course and the CSC 362 course), how do I handle merging this? Should I tell my boss that what he wants isn't feasible?

I apologize for asking so many questions and sounding like a confused idiot, but well, that's exactly what I am. This is my first big boy stats job because I'm in grad school for statistics so I'm brand spanking new to it (background is pure math -- undergrad and masters in it) and just finished my first year. I've never really had to clean data sets before or do any of that kind of work and I'm working with some education and psychology researchers and people this summer which is why they all use SPSS. Because we have a work from home order though I'm using my Mac to do all my work on and I'm actually using my brand new one I just got. The MacBook Pro I was previously using (and had been using for the past 6 years) died about 4 weeks ago and since all the apple stores are closed between my summer courses and work I had to get a new one. I tried a work one for a bit but I couldn't download anything (R/R Studio) and I needed a new personal one anyways so I got this one. My old one had a trial of SPSS on it though and Jesus did that thing never want to freaking work. It always froze on me and made everything so slow. Plus I want to refine my R skills and get good at it (mostly I've just been using SAS this whole first year -- ew, but, well, apparently our school likes to use SAS for some reason idk).

But yeah, I don't know how to best join these data sets and account for the lack of complete responses, and I'm just feeling overwhelmed because nobody else on my team knows how to program in R well and I'm super new to all this statistics and data stuff so I'm just feeling super stressed about it all. This is why I'm turning to r/datascience to help. Thank you for taking the time to read all this and helping a poor grad student out!
