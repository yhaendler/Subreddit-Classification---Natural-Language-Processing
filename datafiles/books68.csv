books,"I can think of only one advantage of e-books over real books: you can adjust the print size, so if you want large print, you can have it. Other than that, it seems like e-books are a total waste.  

\--You don't absorb the text as completely on a screen (whether that is from ""screen overload""--we spend all day on a screen--or something else, I don't know.)

\--You don't really own the book. You can't give it to a friend when you're done. It's just data. You pay your money, and you don't get anything real. Your system could crash and it all disappears.

\--Illustrations on a kindle? Graphs? Annotations? Forget about it.

\--The sense of completion as one nears the end of a book. The percentage icon just doesn't cut it for me.

\--The more e-readers, the less real books. Do we really want a future without books? I don't.

People sometimes say that they like their kindles for vacations because they can store lots of books on it and it's more convenient than carrying real books. I don't know how much you read, but if you're reading more than two or three books on vacation, then you are doing too much reading, and not enough living. You can read at home.

By the way, I'm encouraged by younger people increasingly buying actual books, seeking a more ""real"" experience. It seems like most people reading books on kindles or similar devices are older.

books,"I would give it 4/5 stars. 

I read it because of recommendations saying it was the best psychological thriller of all time. I don’t agree with that, but I found other things to love!

I thought it was written very well. Daphne du Maurier paints scenes vividly, both externally and internally. She does a great job describing Manderley, as well as what is happening in the mind of our heroine. 

The book is sort of creepy, but I was expecting more spookiness. There are a few moments that were chilling though, particularly when Mrs Danvers went off on her recollections of Rebecca. 

I had read people say things like “there are seven mind blowing twists!”. I was a bit disappointed in that regard. There was one incredible twist, and it reframed the whole novel. But it wasn’t mind blowing. 

That being said I found the last ~150 pages to be thrilling, with some twists that kept my attention. 

Even without the twists, it was an engrossing story, and made me feel quite a bit for the unnamed heroine. Nevertheless I did feel the first 2/3 of the novel dragged.

books,"So my girlfriend and I are both big Agatha Christie fans.  We often find ourselves apart from each other, and when we do, we like to read the same Agatha Christie book and try to see who can guess the culprit.  We decided that we could make this into an ongoing game (we are both far too competitive for our own goods).  Here is what we have come up with thus far:

Lets assume there are 30 chapters in every book.  

*If at any time during your reading you have a guess to who committed the crime, you (let's call this person ""Mark"") tell the other person, ""Hey, I have a guess at Chapter 8"".  

*The other person (""Mary"") tells where in the book they currently are.  If they are past Chapter 8, Mary says so, and then Mark tells his guess.  If Mary has not reached Chapter 8, she gets until Chapter 8 to make any guess she wants.  If she waits and wants to guess at Chapter 8, the two parties say their guess at the same time.

*This game is played in aggregate, over the course of many Agatha Christie mysteries.  If someone guesses at Chapter 8, and is correct, they get 22 points, since they guessed 22 Chapters before the end of the book.

*Every player gets 3 guesses per book.  Players can guess any person at any time.  This includes:
      *The same person as your partner later on, in an attempt to reduce the deficit in this book, if you think your partner is right.
      *The same person as yourself later on (""doubling down""), if you think your earlier guess was correct.  However, often these books takes wild twists and turns, so putting all your eggs in one basket may not be the smartest idea.

*In the end, you count how many points each player received (most often only one player receives one point value), and mark it down.  Then, you wait until you want to crack open another mystery and play again.

I hope some reading fans find this as a nice way to share a hobby.  Also, if anyone has any thoughts on how to make this game better, please share!",For fans of Agatha Christie: A game suggestion,1607108143
books,"I've seen as well as participated in discussions about movie adaptations of books. But discussions of movie novelisations don't happen that often. 

One of the best examples in this category I've come across is The Revenge Of The Sith novelisation by Matthew Stover. The book in itself is a fantastic read with a unique writing style. However, the book does a lot more with respect to the movie. It adds a lot of great context to events, adds value to and expands the story arc, and talks about the lightsaber battles in more detail too! What I found the book did best was to allow the reader to get inside the heads of the characters to explore their motivations, doubts, and fears in a way that a movie would find it very hard to. It is a worthy addition to the Star Wars universe and an excellent read for fans, but also a wonderfully written book independent of the movie.

The girl was a high school student that had passed away (a ghost basically) and she presumed the reason why she was still on earth was because of her past crimes which all had to do with theft.

The main protagonist (Francie Brady) is so well crafted and given it's his perspective we hear from throughout, I found really fancinating. 

There we so many occasions where his outlook is so painfully and unknownly skewed, it's difficult to see how the people around him didn't run a mile. Some of the things he does and says are totally irrational yet he always provides his own biased justification for them, providing a really interesting insight into the mind of the psychotic. 

I found it quite sad in the end the way a clearly mentally ill boy is treated by his community yet at the same time the hardship and struggles surrounding Francie dooms him to his fate. 

I know there's been a film adaption yet I given the impression the book has left with me, I might swerve it completely.

But because I probably have ADHD or maybe something destroyed my attention, I stopped reading.

But I always read detective fiction for some reason.
But now I want to read books, like actually profound books.

Anywho here's my list of writers that I think are east to read, so let me know if I am wrong or right(you can also check them yourself if you like:))

Jorge Luis Borges:
Ge is one of the creators of magical realism and he writes very short stories that I think are easy to read,right?

Yukio Mishima:
One of the readers that PewDiePie recommended
And English isn't his first language (likr me) and he read it translated and he became one of his favorite authors.so maybe he is easy to read or got good translationd.

Haruki Murakami :

I have read ""kafka on the shore"" and I must say I am impressed.....I have never ever had something given to me that I didn't understand a thing of.
But this book broke the rule,and I am still waiting to get sime experience with books so I could read thsi magical realism book.
Are any of his other books,well you know, won't make me feel like an actual idiot for not understanding a thing.

Ernest Miller Hemingway:

Have you ever read an article about the life of this guy?

Because I did and I want to read every books he has ever written.
I know his writing is very easy but I also know that he use subtext,so I am afraid I won't understand him the way murakami did.

John Ernst Steinbeck Jr:
I have always heard that he is perfect combination of easiest to read and most profound so maybe I will like his stories?

Naguib Mahfouz:
I am Egyptian and my first language is Arabic and I am interested in existentialism....so maybe he would make a perfect start?

Taha Hussein :
Like Naguib Mahfouz.

Onr thousand and one nights:
Isn't a writer,but it's written in Arabic.

Her 2 book series Buried Lies and The Lies We Tell were so good. Loved the characters and pace of the stories. Couldn’t get enough and felt sad when I had read the second book. However with a lot of googling I found she’s written book 3 with the same protagonist, I’m just waiting for it to be translated into English and sold here 🤞🏽🤞🏽

Anyway, thought I’d share this with you all since I couldn’t find any info about her through searching this sub.","If you haven’t yet read books by Swedish author Kristina Ohlsson, you should give them a try!",1607066291
