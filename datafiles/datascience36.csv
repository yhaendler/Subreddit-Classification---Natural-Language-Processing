Something similar to 0-50 people these are your key objectives, you needs, and who you need to hire. Rinse and repeat for the next stage.

From what I recall, it touched on the topics of the various roles within the data science, what the immediate organization goals should be for each stage and how to progress to the next stage in terms of data maturity. A pyramid of data needs or some similar framework was also proposed. The article was also fairly lengthy from what I remember.

An additional note, I don't believe that it was an article posted on Medium but rather some private blog post. The author seemed to be an industry veteran.

My masters had a lot do to with Optimization, Intelligent systems and numerical simulations and I also had several programming/Data Science related extracurricular activities and personal projects and so it was not that hard to get a position as a Data Scientist. My master thesis was also using Machine Learning. My professional experience includes:

\- Optimization with metaheuristics

\- Time series forecasting

\- Some NLP

\- Data Pipelines with Databricks and Spark

\- A LOT of data cleaning

\- Anomaly/outlier detection and data imputation with unsupervised methods

\- Deterministic models in SQL (LGD model)

I have two dataframes that I need to clusterize where I am trying to do the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Apply PCA to remove outliers and use PCA with 3 components to  visualize it.I am using a total of explained variance of 97,5% for the  outlier removal process.
2. Inverse transform and get the MSE score between the inversed tranformed dataframes and the original ones.
3. Use the IQR upper bracket limit using the calculated MSE score to remove the outliers.
4. Applying the PCA with 3 components to visualize and determine the number of clusters on the new dataframe.

My main issues are:

Is the IQR on MSE a good criteria for removal?

I have limited to the upper bracket since we are working with  absolute values. If not and I am mixing concepts, what would be a good  criteria for this type of transformation?

Or I should drop PCA and go for other methods of outliers detection, if so which?

And ultimately I still visualize points very far from the clusters  when doing the x,y,z plot, does this mean they aren't outliers, just a  few scattered far away points that represent a small cluster? Or the  outlier detecting isn't being effective?

Finally on the second dataframe a 3D visualization has roughly 40% of  explained variance, is it fair to apply the same decision making  process?",Removing outliers with PCA in multidmension (100+) cluster problem,1593000901

datascience,"I really hope someone can help me figure this out and that this post is allowed here. I'm sorry if I violate the rules. I don't think I can find this answer by reading FAQ or browsing on the sub.

So, you have hundreds of pages with hundreds of variables such as time customers visit the page, how long they view the page, the gender of the customer, the country origin of the customers, etc.

You are given the task to find out *which variable that influence the target the most* and *how likely a visitor is to buy based on their historical data*. Initially, I think my solution is **predict the customer churn** by following [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/hands-on-predict-customer-churn-5c2a42806266) tutorial. But I find it very hard to copy the model using the code and I'm not even sure my solution is correct. I keep finding errors on the code in that tutorial.

The steps that I propose are:

1. Reducing customer churn by identifying potential churn candidates
2. Collecting &amp; cleaning relevant data using:
3. Choosing which features we want to include in our data, prepare the data, clean the data
4. Find the right model to train the data (logistic regression &amp; model testing might be possible)
5. Use prepared data to feed the model 
6. Evaluate and interpret results

Tools, libraries, etc.:

* Python
* pandas (to structure data)
* plotly/ matplotlib (to visualize data)
* scikit-learn (to split dataset and train our predictive model)
* linear regression

Can someone tell me if I'm correct or not? If not, what should I better do? Should I find similar case, tutorial, research article?

I am currently writing my thesis in which I try to figure out how to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm ( or/and MDP) on a static environment (e.g. site selection for wind turbines).

I mean, after the clustering and exclusion of specific areas, the ""most valuable"" site(s) can be already seen and there is no need to send an agent into the 'known' environment.

datascience,"Many of us usually have at least one thing that we know we need to do. And if somehow we managed to sit down and do it from start to finish. Our life would be better because of it. The problem is that people put off that thing, they do anything under the sun to distract themselves.

Being a person who naturally gets distracted easily and was surely one of the worst procrastinators. I can confidently say it's never too late to make a change. Because if somehow even I managed to find little strategies and create little short cuts to become someone who can concentrate for long periods of time. Then you can too!

\#1 Why it's so important?

First of all, it's probably not a secret that getting sidetracked nowadays is easier than ever. We are constantly bombarded with ads and online marketing. In fact, according to research, it takes around 15-20 min. to get back to your 100% concentration after getting distracted. Basically, if we cut to the chase - this new distracting digital age creates a huge demand for people who can resist distraction and concentrate.

2#The bar is so lower than you think

If you can dive in even for one hour on your most important thing for the day with a ruthless and intense focus. You will make substantial progress in your life. And as you get used to that hour of concentration. You can upgrade that to 2 or 3 hours. Just think how much intense focus that is. You will skyrocket past your goals!

3# Guilt-free pleasure and balance

I know that many of us want to have a balanced life. We want to achieve something or do something meaningful but still enjoy life. For example, maybe you want to work on your personal projects, but at the same time, you don't want to give up video games. This was one of the biggest pains I struggled myself. I would play a lot of video games but then at the same time I would feel guilty for not making progress on my personal goals. And it's funny because the solution is so simple. You can play the crap out of those video games after you put a tremendous amount of focus on something else. This way you don't feel guilty and can fully immerse yourself into video games.

And if the perks of mastering concentration don't entice you, you can stop here...

But if it interests you, consider reaching out to me - I'd be happy to answer all of your questions!",Why the ability to concentrate is the most important skill in 2020,1592909031

datascience,"Hi,

Due to COVID, I've been looking into switching out of my current major (Hospitality and Tourism Management), and a program that caught my eye was CIS. I am going into my junior year of college. I have the particular credits to switch in without losing too much ground on graduation, although I may need to take on a heavy course load or graduate a semester late, but my fear is that I don't have enough experience with computers.

I'd say I'm more tech-savvy than the average person, but I have no coding experience. I like to work with data and my best skills are communication (explaining concepts and ideas), organization, and aptitude (I pick things up quite quickly, I don't typically need something explained to me twice).

CIS offers me the lifestyle I desire. I'm not incredibly passionate about work, no matter what I would be doing. What I really want is a stable job and a good work-life balance.

Am I making a mistake by switching into a degree I'm not entirely familiar with?

Can I catch up to my classmates by learning on my own?

What resources can I use to learn the foundations of CIS?

I have recently started my Masters in Analytics and my goal is to transition from a marketing role (current) into a data science role. However, as you can imagine the Analytics masters doesn't cover many DS topics.

1. Linear and logistic regression

2. Random Forrest

3. Learning Python, pandas, numpy, sklearn  


I'm having a hard time structuring my learning. Should I work with more datasets to really get down the topics I've already learned? Should I expand into new topics? If so, where? Should I learn different validation processes? Should I learn more math/statistics?
