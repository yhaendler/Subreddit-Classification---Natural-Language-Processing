Hey guys, I'm a huge fan of the nba and there are some ideas I have for projects for data science/analysis related to the nba. I'd love to know your feedback on these ideas or if you guys have any ideas of your own, please share as well.

1. Does homecourt affect a team's chances of winning a game? I wanna see how homecourt affects a team's chances of winning a game, and predict the chance each hometeam has of winning a game. I believe it comes down to skill more than whether a team is the home team or not.
2. Predicting a team's chances of winning the nba draft lottery. Ik that have a worse record gives you a higher chance of winning the lottery, and thus, you get more ping pong balls in the draw. But what would be other features or factors that affect a team's chances of landing the number one pick in the draft?
3. Predicting an nba player's aav salary. I wanna see how durability, the more games you play, winshares, ppg, points allowed per game, three point percentage, and apg would affect a free agent's chances of getting more money in their next contract",NBA Data Science Project ideas,1589500346

datascience,"I just wanted to share my experience in finding out the domain that really sparks me up. TLDR; it's Materials Science,  the scientific study of the properties and applications of materials of construction or manufacture. I had zero solid inclination of this until I randomly decided to pick up the book ""Making the Modern World"" by *Vaclav Smil* and I was just so excited at the notion of reading it, I was at the edge of my seat. I want to stress how unprepared for this sharp change of tactics I was, for I had thought that out of all the domains that were being preached about, like weather forecasting, AI, business, and so on.; I might as well have just sided with *business* and learn from that.  A couple of years ago, at the age of 25, I knew data science was the field for me. I hadn't finished sophomore year of college yet and I was really tiring of the paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle when I, just like today, randomly came across the term *data science*, and it just clicked. I knew that I wanted to take data and make money by analyzing data, but I hadn't known it was an actual job. I wanted to make a lot of money doing it, *but I didn't even know that it was one of the hottest jobs on the market*. Oh Boy! Was I glad. And I dived right in. I began taking Computer Science courses at my local college and I started programming Python, SQL, and R right away. **The Bad News** was that there were just way too many possibilities. I wanted to specialize in something but I didn't have anything to specialize in. I knew I'd be a good data scientist. I knew I'd be a good businessman. I'd be good on a team. I'd be good with presentations and logic. But holy damn! There was just too much demand in the field and I didn't know what motivated me! I was sort of in a programming funk. I knew what I had to do, but I didn't know why to do it. To top it all off! I hadn't the desire to become anything more than a simple human being, regardless of all the materialistic things I wished I could have when I wrote down my life goals and what my legacy was to be. This is how it happened: I was searching to expand my knowledge-base on a few subjects that mattered to me so I bought a few books. One was on shamanism, one on fixated mindsets vs creative mindsets, one one leadership qualities, a couple of others, and I randomly found this book on materials science. I was more excited about this book than the other ones but I didn't know how to articulate why. The book came in today, and my mind just exploded. I knew who I wanted to be. My family is full of scientists and none of them focused on materials science. Every time I look around me; in the living room, in the car, when I'm sitting outside listlessly looking at my garden, I have questions about what everything is made from and what their tolls are on the world around us, on Mother Earth. Now I know what I want to be. I am going to be a nerdy old man with masterful knowledge of what humans are doing to our planet, and hopefully I will have answers for them.

datascience,"On the heels of [this post discussing the demand of data engineers vs data scientists](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gjd820/job_prospects_data_engineering_vs_data_scientist/), I thought I'd share [a fantastic read about the nature of the DS job landscape](http://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/). Note that this is already over 1 year old.

The short of it is this: there's a glut of entry level candidates, and you probably won't outcompete them...if all you're doing is what they're doing. Instead, to get a job in DS, forget about getting a job in DS.

I guess that's a bit click-baity. The point is that your first job probably won't be a DA or DS role, but that's ok, because you should learn the skills that are needed by that first job anyway. 

IMO this is a sobering reality for many would-be data analysts/scientists. And as is often the case with sobering realities, it would end up helping the many, many redditors that are attempting a transition into Data-heavy fields. And as the economic slow down forces companies to also sober up and trim fat, it's all the more relevant.","""Data science is different now"", written in 2019",1589487361

datascience," Iâ€™ve decided to do a write up because similar to many others, I didnâ€™t know where to start my journey on data science. So maybe my post can give you some insights if you decide to take the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) course. (I took it last year, near the end of 2019)

A little background on my coding experience before taking the course: 

* self-learn python through Automate The Boring Stuff and Corey Schafer youtube channel (Canâ€™t recommend him more than enough, he is gold!)
* self-learn SQL, a little bit of pandas and numpy 

The IBM Data Science course consists of 9 parts, by having experience with python and SQL, you can clear Course 1-5 in about 2-3 weeks assuming you set aside time to do it everyday. It basically will feel like recapping what youâ€™ve learnt. (Courses 1-3 is on understanding how to frame the business problem for data analysis and it wonâ€™t take much time to learn).

The hard part starts to come from course 6 onwards where you learn how to manipulate data using pandas and do your data analysis. Course 6-7 is where you learn how to run exploratory and descriptive analysis on jupyter notebooks and do your plottings using matplotlib, sns, folium etc. If youâ€™ve not touch  on pandas before itâ€™ll be a learning curve for you and yes if youâ€™ve returned your stats back to your college teacher, get it back. 

At this stage if you feel overwhelmed, being someone who decided to enroll into this course without prior experience in python or data analysis, give a pat on your back that youâ€™ve managed to come so far, it is so not easy.

Next, course 8 is where you learn the machine learning algorithms- unsupervised and supervised. If you have 0 knowledge about how ML algorithms work before taking the course, youâ€™ll have to keep revisiting the slides to absorb the information. One thing I didnâ€™t like about this section is, there were mistakes in the tutorials and being a complete newbie, I didnâ€™t know till I see others highlighting in the forum section. So donâ€™t blindly follow, you have to understand what youâ€™re learning. 

After course 8, congrats! Youâ€™re left with the capstone project where you have to come up with a business problem, choose an unsupervised ML algorithm for your analysis and submit your reports.

It took me slightly under 2 months to finish the course, I worked on it almost everyday. Is this course worth it? I signed up for this course because well, it is by IBM and IBM materials shouldnâ€™t go wrong right? The course runs on a monthly subscription basis at USD39 per month, meaning the faster you finish the course, the less you will have to pay. If youâ€™re thinking of getting this cert to land a data science job, you would still need to do more learning, this course gives you an intro into what data science involves and as what others have shared, you still need to prep for coding interviews by doing Kaggle etc and continue to up your knowledge in this field. 

Hope this helps!","[AMA] Iâ€™ve completed the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Course, ask me anything you want to know about the course and Iâ€™ll try my best to answer your questions.",1589441223

datascience,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to reach out to those of you who are on the data science field and have some experience on the job already. I started at the bottom on a call center some years back and have been progressing through the ranks to now a leadership position.

&amp;#x200B;

After some time, I came to the realization that I can do more, greater and better things. In the search to be able to perform my role better in developing new processes for our CS team and make better decisions for our clients, I stumbled across Data Science. I had always known that getting some numbers behind your argument and showing it on an Excel/email is better than having something to say at any meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

I started learning SQL as I was unable to find a lot of the data that would help me answer the questions that I believe needed to be answered in order to move my department forward and to validate/negate issues people would bring up about our results but there was no clear way of showing this. There were no good reporting tools and the ones that there were required a lot of editing through Excel, vlookups, filtes, macros. I was a mess. So I took it upon myself to learn how to put together data I needed and then turned into the 'data guy/reports person' for my business unit. The Data Analytics team loved it too as I keep them off their backs with their 'silly and simple requests'.

&amp;#x200B;

I have built some stuff that I think is rather complex nowadays and have a very good grasp of the SQL functions. I do occasionally reach out for help to the Data Analytics team though they usually reply with a 'just go to school if you want to learn'. I have a 2 year diploma on business, but on today's world I really think you can learn anything for free or a very low cost and much faster than school. Also, I'm not digging into student loans...

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to my actual question. I've been improving my skills and getting educated in the realm of Data Science for the last year. I have done a lot of reading, some Udemy courses, IBM Big Data courses and youtube. Again, I have no formal education on this field nor any computer science related degree. Not even a degree... for that matter. Can I actually make the switch?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a very solid (in my opinion) knowledge of SQL and am very proficient on manipulating data on Excel. I have been learning Python and been expanding on the Pandas library for visualization/data analytics. By the end of this year my last step would be to dive into mastering Power BI.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have enough skills to jump into a Data Analyst/Business Analyst position? (I don't really understand the difference between these two).

&amp;#x200B;

I have been told that becoming a BI Developer/BI Analyst (Again.... not sure of what the difference is) should be my goal for now. Does my roadmap on what skills I have and am working on is enough ? and, will I have good chances to transition without a formal education/degree?

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for the long read, but it is a bit of a life changing moment, especially being stuck home.... really powering through being able to come out of this crisis with the ability to change my career prospects.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a bachelors in Business and Sport Management, and have been the manager of a gym for the last 3 years. So my background is nothing really related at all. I have experience coding in Java (I took a course at university), and have spent the lockdown learning from MOOC courses for around 5-6 hours a day +. I also know some python and took an SQL course. 

I was looking at a masters ""conversion"" degree linked here and I applied for it but have not heard back yet:  [https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/msc-data-science-and-business-analytics](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/msc-data-science-and-business-analytics)

I am extremely rusty (or lacking) in mathematics skills that I need and I know that, so Id have to revisit that.

I've taken a few Udemy classes (a Python refresher course, a data science/ML boot camp in Python by Jose Portilla, and a short SQL course also taught by Portilla) and read An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James et al and I'm not quite sure what to do next. I'd like to continue with online learning, and I've started looking at other classes I could take on either Udemy or Coursera, but there's just so many and I don't know which would be best.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning class recommended on here before, but I can't tell if that's at the right level for me right now. Part of the reason I'm posting this right now is because I was starting another Udemy course on ML and it turned out that I was just going over stuff I'd already learned in another course - not a completely bad thing, but I'd like to move beyond the beginner level. Also, I was reading an article on Ng's ML class that mentioned a lack of in-depth mathematics. It was brought up in a positive way, but I'm definitely not one to shy away from the math in this subject (it's one of my favorite parts!).

I hope you guys are all well in the current pandemic! I wanted to get the community's opinion on what you guys think about obtaining a data science degree as a undergraduate vs attempting to obtain a computer science degree.  As you guys are way more experienced than me haha!

I'd also love your input on the current state of potential jobs as a data science major.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background about me, I am a sophomore who just finished my 2nd year of college so I guess that makes me a junior haha?

&amp;#x200B;

I am obtaining a B.S in computer science with a minor in Math and Computer science. (Due to the very similar curriculum between CS and DSC, it is not possible to double major). As for my current experiences, I have worked in a lab for over a year doing machine vision research and this year am doing a NSF funded REU in machine vision remotely for the summer. I have TA'ed for two classes so far and will likely TA for a few more before I graduate. As well as am president of a two clubs on campus..  However, I had no luck in finding internships this year. I can't tell if this was because of covid or just my personal failure. (or it could be my major)

&amp;#x200B;

I am debating on swapping to Computer Science as if I feel that an undergraduate CS major carries more weight than a DSC major due to many programs not having a well established UG curriculum. However, the only difference's in my school between CS and DSC is that for the required courses, CS has required operating systems, program design, and hardware classes while DSC has more SQL, Machine Learning, and Statistical classes such as time series analysis and upper level Math courses. As well as requires a senior capstone. In fact, my current pathway would cause me to take MORE CS/DSC courses than just obtaining a BS in C.S due to my minor in CS with  DSC degree. However, I am unclear how to convey this without listing every possible course I've taken on my resume as my projects are pretty data-scienceish.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still slightly unclear on I truly want after graduation. The ultimate goal of mine is to make $$ so I can help my sister through college and my mom until she retires after my dad has passed away recently. That being said, I am open to working as a Software Developer as well as a Data scientists/Analysts. I know I have the skills and coding experience to do both.

&amp;#x200B;

However, like I said earlier. I am afraid that I will be passed up for Software Developer roles for not traditionally being a CS major by recruiters and at the same time passed up for Data science roles due to not having higher education. I don't have the financial means to go to Graduate school at this time either.
