datascience,"**BG:** I'm a director of data science at a global Fortune 500 firm and am constantly on the lookout for talent (barring currently with the virus).  I recruit pretty heavily with prestigious universities in the U.S. out of their data science programs.

**Issue:**  I find it is difficult as a needle in a haystack to find qualified data scientists with proper communication skills and general business sense.  Many of these recruits have their data science masters degrees and quite of few of them have their bachelors in some sort of business degree. Many others have engineering or statistical backgrounds.

I will often get a stack of dozens of resumes each with all the check marks crossed in terms of programming and courses but when I go to speak to the students it is a near disaster.  I ask them to explain very simple concepts and they often go off on 5 minute answers that are rambling and incoherent.  I need these candidates to be able to communicate across different sides of the business, often times with individuals that have little to no understanding of data science.  It almost feels like I need someone like the guy from office space that took the specs from engineers and handed them off to marketing or sales because the two sides couldn't communicate with each other.

**Q&amp;A:** Has anyone run into similar difficulties?  How do you work with these candidates?   Do you hire them and then train their soft skills or do you only hire candidates with the full package?",For those on the hiring side: how do you deal with incoming or prospective data scientists with little to no communication skills?,1588634870

Time series forecasting is one of the most important topics in data science. Imagine that you are a business owner, you might want to predict different sorts of future events to make better decisions and optimize your resource allocation. Typical examples of time series forecasting use cases are retail sales forecasting, package shipment delay forecasting, energy demand forecasting, and financial forecasting. As you can see, forecasting is everywhere!

Given its ubiquitous nature and wide-ranging business applications, we have developed an open-source [forecasting repo](https://github.com/microsoft/forecasting?WT.mc_id=github-reddit-lazzeri) that puts world-class models and forecasting best practices in the hands of data scientists and industry experts — i.e., you!

# Forecasting Best Practices and Solution Accelerators

This repository provides examples of building forecasting solutions presented as Python Jupyter notebooks, R markdown files, and a library of utility functions. Our goal is to help you as a data scientist or machine learning engineer with varying levels of knowledge in forecasting:

* Learn best practices for the development of forecasting solutions in a variety of languages.
* Leverage recent advances in forecasting algorithms to build high-performance solutions and operationalize them.
* Accelerate the solution development process for real-world forecasting problems. With the provided examples, you will be able to significantly reduce the “time to market” by simplifying the experience from defining the business problem to the development of solutions by orders of magnitude.

In the repository, you will find state-of-the-art (SOAT) forecasting models using traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. Implementations of SOTA models in this release are centered around retail sales forecasting and are written in Python and R, two of the most popular programming languages in the forecasting domain. To enable high-throughput forecasting scenarios, we have included notebooks for forecasting multiple time series with distributed training techniques such as Ray in Python, the parallel package in R, and multi-threading in LightGBM. 

The repository also comes with [Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?WT.mc_id=medium-article-lazzeri) ([Azure ML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?WT.mc_id=medium-article-lazzeri)) themed notebooks and best practices recipes to accelerate the development of scalable, production-grade forecasting solutions on [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/?WT.mc_id=medium-article-lazzeri). You will find the following examples for forecasting with [Azure AutoML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml?WT.mc_id=medium-article-lazzeri) as well as tuning and deploying a forecasting model on [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/?WT.mc_id=medium-article-lazzeri).

Developing an accurate forecasting solution can be a complex and time-consuming process. We hope the forecasting repo will help shorten your development cycle on [Azure.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/?WT.mc_id=medium-article-lazzeri)

And how do I structure all of my code into reusable functions that are useful for more than one project? Etc.) I want to help people fill in those knowledge gaps as they learn how to do real things, and use their own curiosity to drive further learning.

I'm looking for any feedback on how to make Project Data Science better for students—my goal is to create a valuable set of courses and projects that aspiring data scientists can use to accelerate their learning and fill in the gaps that arise during practical implementation. Ideally I'd love to bridge more and more of that gap between the deep theory and the practical (I'm a big math nerd at heart), but I want to do it through the lens of real projects so that people create while they're learning.

I have been working as a data analyst for about 3 years and about 2 years ago I switched to Pandas due to how much potential it had to improve my life: I am very bad at cataloging and record keeping, so doing things in Pandas makes everything so traceable and reproducible for me. Plus Excel always becomes super slow for me when the rows surpass 80K.

This week I will give my team members a quick demonstration of Pandas's capabilities. A lot of my team members use Excel for most of their data analysis, so I'd like to show them some handy operations that can be done by Pandas in much shorter time, hence improving our efficiency.

Several operations I have in mind are:

* The magic power of \`unstack\` to move columns into rows, usually accompanying \`set\_index()\` and \`groupby\`.
* \`df.duplicated()\`, esp if I want to find the rows that have duplicate values in some columns, I can do \`df\[df.duplicated(\['A', 'B'\], keep=False)\]\`
* I always have to write a pretty long formula in Excel to find values in column A that is in or not in column B. I love how I can just do \`df\[\~df.colA.isin(df1.colB)\]'

That's about what I have in mind right now. Some other operations like \`drop\_duplicates()\` or \`sum()\` can be done not without too much effort in Excel. I don't think I need to talk about groupby() as we all use SQL on a regular basis.

Would anyone care to give me some additional examples please?

datascience,"Hi everyone. Hope everyone is doing okay during these strange times. I have a few questions about presentation skills:

What kinds of presentation skills do you find most important to hone at work? What did you do to develop these skills? And finally, how do you deal with fear of public speaking? 

The latter is something I struggle with immensely. I spend a lot of time familiarizing myself with the topic I plan to present, organizing my materials so they “tell a story”, practice giving mock presentations and try to think of questions that the audience may ask. I feel comfortable with the knowledge, but find myself freezing up once I actually have to present. I’ve always struggled with performance anxiety. My heart starts pounding, my palms get sweaty, and I start getting tunnel vision. This seems to happen regardless of how much preparation I do.

I am an aspiring data analyst who is currently seeking inputs on how to better equip myself with the relevant skills to be one. My job skills are mainly focused on data extraction from in house systems and exporting through Excel and generating reports via PowerPoint.

Recently, I started focusing on learning new skills to better improve myself. As a data analyst, I wish to analyze data and generate insights to what the data means to provide my company with meaningful business decisions.

As a newbie in this, here's the list of courses/resources I have done:

*  Learning Basics of Python (Python Crash Course from Eric Matthes) [Ongoing]
*  Basic Statistics (University of Amsterdam from Coursera) [Ongoing]
*  Introduction to SAP Analytics Cloud [Ongoing] : I am taking this as my company uses this and doesn't use Tableau

I feel that I am making a lot of progress with learning Python as the question examples at the end of every chapter would test my knowledge. Moreover, I find that practicing what I have learnt allows me to retain information easier.

Below are some courses which I am interested in taking once I have completed the above:

*  Data Analysis with Python
*  Introduction to SQL (The Complete SQL Bootcamp)
*  Regression Analysis
*  Pandas



As you can see, all the current courses I am taking now are essentially just a beginner's course of what a data analyst does and does not provide in-depth teachings. Could you please recommend what I should focus on and advise if I am on the right track?

* Any trainings/certifications/courses you'd recommend for someone who is self taught to have a leg up at getting hired?
* I'm expecting a significant pay cut if I get hired, which I'm totally fine with because I'm enjoying data science so much more than what I was doing. However, what is the earning potential in the 3-5 year timeframe?
