datascience,"I have a table of data with about 200columns and about 500k observations.  I'm planning to run a some sort of classification model on it for inference purposes (i,e  interpret the coefficients, so maybe a logit), but I want to see if I can narrow my columns a bit before I start.

The variables are of mixed data type:   
continuous(i.e, dollars),  
discrete(counts)  
categorical (0/1 indicators)  
grouped (i,e credit score from the continuous column  is grouped low,med, high) etc,  
char(states, regions, etc).

My response variable would be categorical(trying to predict a 1).

Curious what would be the best way to reduce dimension of  the dataset, or maybe find variables that will not add value before I start modelling.  Looking manually through them, the 'grouped' variables are probably redundant with the other data, so I may want to pick one or the other, but i'm wondering if there is a better way to do this.

I am wondering, is it possible to overlay data of stock charts to extrapolate daily/weekly trends using averages? I'm not making sense, let me try this: 

In other words, typical charts are X time, and Y price. 

Basically, 

X would be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday

Y would be either 0 to infinity or maybe undefined price(?). 

Z(?) would be the average of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday for 52 weeks (or more). 

In theory, I am wondering if a chart can be made showing the average movements of Monday through Friday on a particular stock. 

A one year chart shows the change in price, month-to-month. This one year chart would show the average change in direction day-to-day for 52 weeks. It's not about how Company ABC went from $15.00 Jan 1 2019 to $23.50 Jan 1 2020. But rather, what are the average movements on a day-to-day basis based on 52 week charts.

Another way to explain it is: imagine you're looking at a 5-day chart. Now imagine 52 weeks of 5-day charts overlay resulting in one final image that shows the average day-to-day movement based on the average of 52-weeks of 5-day charts. 

Maybe beta, historic volatility, rsi, and volume can all be factored in as well? I understand that regardless, there is always going to be entropy involved but I keep wondering if there is some sort of pattern. 

Probably not. 

I don't actually think I'm on to anything here, I'm not a student, I'm not a scientist, or engineer. But, I keep wondering what this even is?

Hi everyone, 

I've been in the organization of a data challenge for two years now and I'd like to share some comments as well as receiving input from the community. I'm growing discontent with our format, which prompted this post.

The goal of the challenge is to teach data analysis to business and engineering students ; their skills in programming range from beginners to decent but they're usually beginners. In the end, they have to prepare slides to explain their modeling process and models. We reward performance, originality, code quality and also how engineering and/or business comes into play in their models.

Please do comment and advice.

# Setup

During the challenge duration, the students are learning online on DataCamp plus some workshops to get a feel of what they're up against, over 4-6 months. It's completely voluntary, meaning that the engagement is somewhat limited but they're usually motivated enough to go through the learning material.

A company or a sponsor provides us with clean data and the challengers have to tackle a well-defined task, such as classification of comments (NLP) or image classification (CV), *Ã  la* Kaggle. 

They're given access to the data and have to provide a notebook or a code file, ran on Colab, which is graded. 

Most people seem satisfied but we've got complaints about Colab being unstable which breaks the training process and I personally believe we could deliver more than what we're currently doing. 

# Feedback

I keep in mind that my public is usually not CS/IT oriented but here are my problems with the current format.

## Data

Currently, the data challenge is focused on clean, well-formated data which is way too unrealistic and gives a wrong picture of the usual data science problem. 

- Most real data is either unavailable from the get-go, in the wrong format, redundant, incomplete or all of those and more. **I'd like to emphasize data collection, smart/efficient reshaping and sane pipelines**. 


- Most real data is in tabular form, in spreadsheets &amp; databases and usually not in a model ready way. Because most of those storage methods were created with redundance, tracking and information in mind, they're absolutely not ready to be model oriented. **I'd like to emphasize problem solving and relationships between the problem and the data**. 


- Closely related, your data does not come with a target variable, it's usually up to you to find or create it and you'll find yourself debating with sales people and focusing on what they actually need rather popping the good ol' ``model.fit(X,y)``.  As such, **I'd like to emphasize business goals and proper targeting**. 


## Goals

- The goal and the problem should come before data science in the thought process, I'm not sure if I should have the students present their goals *before* the whole data science process. 

- We don't talk about the metrics enough, ideally I'd like the students to pick a metric themselves and motivate their choice for for the final presentation. Several metrics could be picked and ordered to show different sides of the business problem.

- A more meta goal is that the competition should be enjoyable, I'm trying to avoid very grindy phases and we're suffering of the Kaggle problem, which is that the students will focus almost exclusively on model performance and bland training tweaks. 

## Learning to learn 

I'm relatively pleased with DataCamp and even though they still do too much hand-holding, the website is good. Still, I'd like to have more focused and short projects about data manipulation and business targeting to help the students. My thinking now is that we could setup a fictitious meeting between data scientists and sales/marketing people for the students to watch. This is more work on my and our sponsors' ends but I think it's worth it. 

I'm not sure what else to add but comments are welcome.


## Tools throughout

 For now we rely on Anaconda and Colab. I'm satisfied with Anaconda for the environment management and relatively hassle free installations so I'll stick with that. The issue I'm facing now is that the challenge is NOT a software engineering problem nor is it a tooling competition.

I'm wondering if I should introduce Docker and git at all and if we should stick with notebooks for now. My guts say that it's absolutely important but I can't have them squander their time and energy either, the balance is hard to find.


# Miscellaneous 

Not everything is in my hand and the result will vary depending on the support we get from both the faculty and the sponsors we can get. For example, getting a server to store the data is surprisingly difficult. We often have to send them wetransfer or drive links.

I am not sure if this post belongs here and if it doesn't feel free to remove it. I am writing this as now it is beyond my mind to handle and I know no-one who can answer my questions.

I am currently a third-year undergraduate majoring in ""Data Science"" at a university with ranking under 50 worldwide. Before taking the decision to choose this major, I got advice from many people like ""Data Science is the future, kid"", ""Data science is the sexiest job out there"" and whatnot. I was genuinely quite interested in the general idea of it too. Machine learning/AI all these buzzwords and ""data science"" courses coming up in the world. So, I decided to take up this undergrad course with a huge student loan over my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, after getting some insight into the field (which might smaller than everyone in this sub), I feel so depressed on my own. I mean, I am interested in it and feel passionate about it but the prospects and opportunities are not what I had in mind (or maybe this is my depression speaking, IDK). I have been trying to look up for internships/part-time jobs or anything beginner level, but whatever job specifications I see, they all want just too much of experience. I am honestly fine to work for free/volunteer right now to at least gain some experience. Till now, I have completed some projects, I also have a GitHub repo for them. I got my LinkedIn topped up with whatever I did. I also score well at the University. But I get no response to anything I apply. I just feel shit. At times I don't even know what are the job titles I should apply for! At this point, I can find a job title with all the permutations and combinations of buzzwords! (Data analyst, Data wizard analyst, SQL analyst, business data analyst, machine learning analyst, quantitative analyst etc etc etc). I don't know what should I apply for. And the name doesn't seem to mean anything at many times as same titles have completely different responsibilities. Do I also have to have some development experience to get into anything? If yes than what's the limit, what should I learn that will suffice for development pre-requisites. I am honestly tired of bookmarking all the (copied)""Tutorial blah blah"" articles on medium/""How to land a job in data science(the sexiestest job of fcking century)"".

&amp;#x200B;

I just keep scrolling through data science projects, data analyst jobs/internships and how it is making a difference and whatnot. My whole nights and days go like this. I keep reading posts/job lists and they all say that they will prefer a Masters/PhD for any job. All this just makes me feel quite depressed and hopeless. I feel I made a bad decision in the first place, I mean I am fascinated by the field and it keeps my brain going but I can't pay my huge loan with it. I don't know what should I do. All undergrad jobs/interns (which are already quite less ) are just so competitive, I always feel I don't know enough and someone else will be more deserving than me. Am I just dump for this field? Should I drop out of my college and think about some other field? IDK. What exactly is the real scenario? I am tired of hearing opinions and predictions of the future! Can someone please tell me what should I do as an undergraduate to at least not be left jobless after my graduation? I don't want anything fancy, I honestly just want a normal career, I am willing to put my full potential even if I see a small ray of hope. I want to get out of this world with buzzwords, I need something real out of it.

datascience,"I have a couple of csv where there are two columns: Item and Price. Some csv's have different number of rows, some match exactly. How can I then combine the csv's so that the prices match up to the correct index name (Item) where the prices for each csv goes into it's own column (as date of csv) AND if the Item is not present in the index, it will get concatenated? 

I manually added the file creation date as another column for each csv since I failed to take this into account when I generated the first batch, but I'm not sure this is actually useful since I can just set the label name as the date.

datascience,"First and foremost thanks for taking the time to read this post as it's a bit unconventional. Jumping right in; I'm in my mid twenties and have a BA degree in psychology. In recent months I've developed an interest in working in data analytics and possibly data science down the road. For the past 2 years I've been working as an assistant project manager in the residential sector. Due to the nature of this work, I have great communication skills and proficiency in Microsoft excel. Further, for the past 6 months I've been studying for the graduate school entrance exam (GRE, US based), and learning the basics of python and SQL as I've read they're key to the industry. What I'm essentially asking is what is my best course of action for getting a job in data analytics and eventually data science? Any and all insight is greatly appreciated, thanks!

Iâm hoping to matriculate into medical school next fall but am seeking a a stable job for the next year or so. I have a BA in economics that included advanced stats coursework and projects. I also have a bit of experience using Python and SPSS in my research. Iâm seeking advice on how to get started and assume it will be easier to start as a data analyst. Iâve been sending out my resume with no luck but figure COVID is at least playing a role. Does anyone have an estimate for how long it will take to get hired? Also, how long after completing intro courses like these can I get hired? Iâm currently a PT tutor but am looking for more hours and higher pay.

datascience,"  Hey Guys,

I'm trying to build a decision support model for a brand to help to help in deciding where to open a new store of the brand in an urban area.

The model will be focused on location observations (lat-lng, time, duration) of smartphone users around the city (totally ignoring income and finance considerations).

I've extracted from these observations visiting occurrences at stores of the brand and also other brands around the city.

I'm trying to plan my next steps but unfortunately right now I'm a bit stuck. 

I was thinking to try a network approach to find a missing node, but still defining the connections is still tricky.

I would appreciate if someone encountered a related paper that might shed some light on how can I progress, or maybe have an idea of how to move on?

This may just be PTSD from my choice of undergrad talking.
