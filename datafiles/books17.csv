books,"Tintin has long played a part in my life, through the large comic-style albums I owned as a child, to the reissued collection I’m halfway through today. In between there’s been the old cartoon series of films and the 2011 motion capture experiment from Steven Spielberg.

What grounds my love of Tintin is my own adventure creating a comic in primary school. Called The Giggle, I wrote and drew about half an issue each week with two friends. After collecting a series of A4 sheets of paper, my dad would photocopy them at work and we’d staple then distribute them around school. We didn’t produce many, but they were a labour of love.

On leaving the school, and so my tenure as the comic’s sole editor, one of my teachers bought me a copy of Explorers on the Moon as a thank you for giving him The Giggle each week. As soon as I read the story, my fascination with the little Belgian reporter began.

The Blue Lotus is the fifth title in the Adventures of Tintin series and follows on from the previous collection, Cigars of the Pharaoh. Many consider the story the best in the canon. Beginning in India, The Blue Lotus follows Tintin as he uncovers a mystery surrounding Shanghai and the opium trade. As the reporter digs deeper, he finds plans running far deeper than drug smuggling and stumbles across some old friends.

The beauty of The Blue Lotus is more than a collection of parts, it’s the wider success of the format itself. In taking an already well-worn character and placing him in a tightly plotted adventure with high stakes, sharp drawing, sparse dialogue and clever imagery, Herge created a masterpiece of any type of novel.

After writing my reviews, I like to read what others have written about the book and tend to reference one or two comments in my own article. With The Blue Lotus I’ve found it difficult to find good writers talking about the book, leading me to believe this is because it’s a comic or graphic novel. That’s a shame, as the story quality here is no weaker for it being drawn. The themes, plot and characters work just as well as a regular novel and it’s refreshing to read in another format. I hope that books like this begin to get serious recognition as new writers find voices in major literary publications.

I find it impossible to stay away from Tintin and, once I start, fruitless to try to put one of Herge’s stories down. The Blue Lotus is not my favourite Tintin collection, yet the story itself is one of the best. It deals with international themes of war, politics and crime before you realise what you’re reading. It’s not the first Tintin book you should read, but if you do it’s unlikely that it will be your last.",The Blue Lotus,1584661127
books,"Much like my introduction to Tintin, I was first passed a copy of The Big Sleep by a favourite teacher. This time is was well into Secondary School, either GCSE or A Level years and it was my English teacher, Mr Dawson. Beyond my family, he was most responsible for both my love of reading and long-standing dream of writing my own stories.
Following a class reading of The Adventure of the Speckled Band, which I’d read before and was something of a naïve expert on, he brought a copy in and offered it to me as a loan. For some reason, the book sat in my room until he gently reminded me that he’d need it back. Shocked at my forgetfulness, I raced through the pages in a few nights and returned in the same week.

The connection to Sherlock Holmes seemed at once clear and distant. The novel’s detective, Phillip Marlowe, is as determined, intelligent and single-minded as his predecessor. Yet, this was something new too. He was involved in his case like Holmes rarely seemed to be, messing around with victims and suspects. Where Holmes intervened to solve a crime, Marlow almost seems to propel it forward and wasn’t too bothered with loose ends. Without Mr Dawson and that book loan, I might not have come to appreciate detective fiction’s diversity.

The Big Sleep, I soon learned many years ago, is the first novel to feature Phillip Marlowe. Published in 1939, it builds an a number of Chandler’s many short stories featured in Black Mask. The story follows the Private Detective as he investigates the blackmail of a wealthy family’s wild-child daughter. Before long, Marlowe uncovers much more than he’d being paid to find and the bodies start mounting up.

In truth, the plot of the novel is only marginally relevant. It’s purposefully loose and messy, something Chandler makes no apology for. The real genius is in the atmosphere of mystery, double-dealing and noir that the author builds with every turning page. Perhaps even more so, the flawless characterisation of the deeply flawed central character (even here I hesitate from labelling Marlow as our hero as he’s no such thing, although more riotous than he’d care to admit).

Genius is a strong word but highly used with Chandler, who has long since shaken off any reputation for writing ‘detective fiction’. In his review of the novel, Robert McCrum quotes another literary titan:
The Big Sleep transcends its genre, moving WH Auden to write that Chandler’s thrillers “should be read and judged, not as escape literature, but as works of art”.

Reading The Big Sleep is essentially to understanding why we read anything. It’s a mix of pure entertainment, mystery and literary art. There’s a reason its been chosen in top 100 lists by Time, Le Monde and The Guardian. Consider this essay your personal English teacher, reaching out with an opportunity to change how you think about what novels can achieve.",The Big Sleep,1584661090

books,"I have read that book maybe 10 times. Every day passes and I get chills to my core on how much of what happened in the book has played out in real life.

To those that haven't read World War Z: It's a book about the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. A journalist from the UN interviews many people that lived through the ""Z War"". Unlike most zombie stories, WWZ describes the beginning, middle and end of the zombie apocalypse (95% of all zombie films just focus on the middle).

I don't want to spoil the book for anyone that has not read it, but it's great. Remove the ""zombies"" part and you will feel like reading a history book written in 2120 about the Coronavirus pandemic.

Yes the pandemic in the book involves zombies, but everything else - The Great Panic, the gag orders and censorship, the misinformation, false cures, the aloofness of the population, the fact it also originated in goddamn China...

The reason I loved the book so much was that unlike the your run of the mill Z apocalypse movie, it felt soo real. Like it actually happened. And when the Coronavirus epidemic begun I assumed some things will play out like they have in the book. But I didn't imagine **so many things would be the same.**

I kind of wish I haven't read it. Predicting so much of what happened weeks before is disheartening and scary, even though it has helped me prepare my family.

books,"Okay. Chapter 9. Orr has a different dream. He meets an alien who teaches him a magic word. He regains his stability of mind, ""He was back where he belonged"". He wakes up and tells Haber He cannot let him continue to use his dreams. He stands firm and confident for the first time in the novel. Haber gives him an ultimatum: be back here tomorrow or else. He replies, defiant: ""I'll come."" I got shivers from that line.

In my mind this was a clear setup for the final confrontation, Orr has learned to control his dreams, but not in the same sense that Haber controls them. A more holistic, Taoist sort of control, which is much more Ursula's style. Haber is destroyed by his own hubris, the world is restored to some acceptable level of normalcy, Orr and Lelache live happily ever after.

Chapter 10. 

Actually George has not gained confidence or control or anything of the sort. He wanders around feeling lost, disconnected from reality. He talks to another alien, this encounter adds nothing new to his understanding of his condition. Back home he falls asleep to a Beatles record and dreams Lelache back into existence. Ok. ""everyone needs a little help from their friends"" is a nice message. This is fine.

They go to Haber's office. This is it. As Haber puts him under, Orr mutters his magic word. And then.... Nothing. He wakes up, Haber's induction worked, he has done away with Orr's power, and now has the ability to reproduce it in himself. The magic word did nothing, sure, it summoned Lelache, but she is sitting there doing nothing! And then, Orr and Lelache JUST WALK OUT OF THE OFFICE. What? The fuck? Orr knows perfectly well what he's going to do with that power. And he just leaves. Before they're even out of the building, reality starts crumbling around them. We get that awesome sequence of Orr fighting the nightmare to get to the machine and shut it down.

And that's that. 

Haber is a mad scientist whose mad creation destroys him. Textbook poetic justice. But he takes everyone else down with him! We all get to live in Haber's mangled world! Ursula teases us with another scene of Orr going to sleep, but it's true, his power is really gone. We get the happily ever after with Lelache, but the world is broken and Orr learned nothing. Also Lelache doesn't have the memories from the other timelines, so Orr gets to live the rest of his life carrying that burden alone. Yay.

I really wish we'd gotten some kind of symbolic victory for Orr... Haber puts him under. he mutters the word. Haber is making speeches at Lelache as the world starts changing around them. He tries desperately to fiddle with his machines, but they disappear before his eyes...

OR, how about this, Haber succeeds, Orr does lose the power. That actually puts a neat little bow on the story. But! As he leaves the office, he uses the alien words to plant an induction in Haber's mind, as they exit the building reality is restored back to normal, *cool guys don't look at explosions* style.

OR, what if Lelache actually had some meaningful role to play in this climax? What if her heavy purse and bangles and stuff turned out to be a Chekhov's gun, and she bunks Haber in the head with them? I think we could have used some more physicality and humor in the ending.

I don't know! I just really got this weird feeling about the last two chapters. Like she had written the book up to Ch.9 and then came back years later and wrapped it up for the publishers. I was very bewildered.

This last week I finished Stranger in a Strange Land and I really enjoyed it. Instantly thought it was a classic and deserved to be mentioned in company of others like 1984 and Brave New World. There were a lot of similarities in concept and style. Same focus on how organizations/religions can skew and manipulate. Also, these classic dystopian/utopian books really focus a lot on sex, and I contributed it to the times. Lots of exploration of sex and concepts of modesty and freedom. Also, women really got painted into a corner, didn't they? In Stranger and in 1984/Brave New World. Heinlein kept having his characters refer to them as little girls, and they were pretty much fembots that served dinner, took orders, and had sex. 

Michael was an interesting character with an interesting arc from almost childlike to almost innocently (?) manipulative and controlling. I liked him at first, understood his reasoning throughout, but came to kind of hate him in the end. Which made me reflect on time and the concept of living so long and being so connected that discorporating wasn't a big deal. 

Not sure I got all of the heaven and angel stuff. Was he Michael the Archangel? Was he just a man raised Martian who had metaphysical powers? He was able to teach people his ways. Does time make fools of us all?

Overall, again, I'm convinced it's just as good as books like 1984 and Brave New World. In fact, I think I enjoyed it more than 1984.",I finished Stranger in a Strange Land for the first time this week. A few thoughts.,1584634391

books,"I read Butler's Parable of the Sower for the first time about a month ago.  Since then it's been stuck in my head for many reasons.  Initially, the Earth Seed development and growth was truly fascinating and still is to think about.  The narrative itself was engaging, entertaining, and likewise thought provoking throughout.  Butler's crumbling collapse of society felt like logical extensions of societal behaviors and provided its destruction in a very well thought-out and logical manner.

With everything going on the past week or so the book is on my mind even more.  Certainly the Earth Seed teachings are floating around and Lauren's general sense to PREPARE and SURVIVE, but the unsettling part to me is how close the book actually mimicked real life since it's publication in the early 90s. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We can get ready.  That's what we've got to do now.  Get ready for what's going to happen, get ready to survive it, get ready to make a life afterward. Get focused on arranging to survive so that we can do more than just get batted around by crazy people, desperate people, thugs, and leaders who don't know what they're doing!

I'm not trying to raise the alarm here or signal this as the collapse of everything.  This book had been on my mind a lot and for many good (and non current event) reasons.  There are certainly prophetic parts of the book and in light of what's happening now it is somewhat unsettling.  Still, the book does provide hope in the face of darkness and destruction and it certainly drives home that society hinges on the balancing act between the individual's responsibility to society at large - which may at times seemingly be in contrast with the individual's goals or gain.

Hopefully this provides us a chance to acknowledge and harness Change to better prepare ourselves for survival in the future.",Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler,1584630882

books,"I have never been much of a reader. Growing up, I'd skim stuff for school and then usually come out with a B/C grade on anything involving the books. I just never could do it. Fast forward to about a year or two ago and a friend was reading a book and raving about it. I talked to him about how I literally can't read - I pick something up and read 5 pages and then I'm done. He recommended I try this book out and I'm so glad I did because now I've been reading a lot more. I've read 5 books so far this year and that is HUGE for me given the fact that I probably never read 5 books for fun in my entire life.

That book was Ready Player One. So, what book got you into, or back into, reading? Looking forward to seeing people's responses and hopefully pick up a few good reads too!",What book got you into reading (or back into reading)?,1584628348
books,"In fact it's probably a good thing. Sorry if this triggers all you attention seeking hipsters on forums like these who boast about reading 100+ books a year, but fictional literature in particular is dead. No one will be studying anything written post 2000 in twenty years time, let alone a century from now. Literature is not nearly as good as it was in the 19th century. It's been downhill since.

But don't take it personally book nerds, all creative outputs have their peaks and their degeneration. It's not just books, but cinema and music as well that have turned to fecal matter. Far  superior storytelling can be found in television and gaming.

So put down your crappy millennial books and find far better fields of storytelling. That, or get a life.",It's not a tragedy that more and more people are reading less and less.,1584628231
books,"Recently, I began reading the *Throne of Glass* series by Sarah J. Maas. **How did I figure out the existence of it?** That is a pretty interesting story, so let me start with it first and get to my impressions.

About two months ago I went into a local bookstore and started searching for something that would grab my attention. I stayed there, looking at the shelves for more than an hour, but at last something caught my attention. I looked at it and saw: *Kingdom of Ash*. It grabbed my attention *(I knew it beforehand from friends who had told me it was a pretty cool book)* and I immediately bought it.

The moment I came back home, I ***grabbed the book*** and started reading. *Excitement, excitement, excitement!* I read the first 50 pages in not time, but then I realised something.

""What the F?"", I said to myself. ""I understand nothing of this stuff that is going on here. Who are these guys?""

Then I close the book, turn it around and see the **big fat 7** on the side of it.

""Oh...""

At that moment I hoped I hadn't screwed up buying the last book of a series that I haven't even read the first book of.

The next day, however, ***I got book 1***, and read it for a week - not so fast, not so slow. Not going to lie, it started off kind of slowly, but then took off and the ending got me in desire for more. I loved *Celaena Sardothien*'s personality, reactions, friends (that is the exact kind of girls I am into, but not that is the point), I loved how the timeline unraveled and uncovered cases that were unimaginable for me.

**With one word, I enjoyed the book and bought the second one.** *Crown of Midnight*

Same thing, but my feelings were enhanced, I loved and hated some of the dialogues, characters and cases. There were many scenarios that I had no idea how she will survive the situation, but Sarah always managed to come up with the best outcome... I enjoyed the book even more than the first one and the ending... *The ending got me wanting more. Like... Like a* ***drug.***

**There we go... Book 3.** *Heir of Fire*

I shall start off without any spoilers, but then will include some things that totally blew me away.

* The plot had both **expected** and **unexpected** scenes.
* Even though I had feelings for what would happen, I was still **captivated** by way presenting it.
* Every. Single. Chapter. Ended on a **cliffhanger.**
* Sarah understood that she was using a plot technique she had used before, but that was no defect of the book - she ***managed to make something great out of it.***
* Last, but definitely not least, ***the ending***... I mean, I believe Sarah is a goddess at writing a perfect ending that would want you to immediately start off the next book.

However, this time I expected a strong ending, as it was in the other books, so bought the fourth book. 

But, hell! ***Such an ending!*** I did not expect such an ending! At one moment I was at my bed and reading peacefully, and at another I was ***shouting with amaze!*** Now that I am writing that I realize how funny it might have looked if someone else was with me... Okay, that is enough with no spoilers. Here I go:

&gt;!Hello, people who have read Heir of Fire. I hope you understand my feelings.!&lt;

&gt;!Honestly, I knew Celaena was Aelyn Galathynius. Her meeting Rowan had me believe that they had something in common. It was obvious for me - the behaviour, ancestors, etc. It kind of reminded me with the story of Celaena and Chaol. Actually, It was almost the same in an idea point of view. This becoming a real strong friendship I could foresee. !&lt;

&gt;!I loved how Dorian Havilliard understood Celaena and even was able to move on with Sorscha. And because of this girl that walked in his life he was able to understand Chaol. That, I believe is even one of the reasons he would sacrifice his own self because of his best friend (that is the part when I was shouting).!&lt;

&gt;!Okay, the ending. WHAT?! THAT HAPPENED? I know it was the only way, but it all came down as a damned lightning to me. So fast!!&lt;

&gt;!Edion, Chaol, Dorian, Sorscha and the king. In one room! He knew? Or he was just bluffing? It does NOT matter! His plans worked out perfectly... Unfortunately...!&lt;

* &gt;!Edion's sacrifice! That is a man! He did not say a word about his plans with Chaol and even if he doomed himself to never seeing his beloved cousin Aelin ever again he knew what was stronger than his desire. That was love. He sacrificed himself in the name of love! Celaena and Chaol's. I don't know if you are a Dorian or Chaol kind of person, but I am definitely a Chaol one.!&lt;
* &gt;!Sorscha's death... Yeah... That sucks. I did not expect her to be caught. I did not expect her to have been sending letters to the rebels. That was a wow moment for me. Also... Heartbraking... Another aspect of love, but the destructive one.!&lt;
* &gt;!Dorian... He could hide his powers at first, but he could not emotionally bear the loss of his greatest friend - he called him a king nonetheless! It seems as he could finally understand his motifs - he did everything in order to protect Dorian. Now it was Dorian's turn. I loved that moment! (That was when I was shouting the loudest)!&lt;
* &gt;!Chaol's reaction to it all - a perfect one for a man with honor. I don't have much to say, I just hope he saves Dorian and gets together with his beloved.!&lt;
* &gt;!The king... What can I say... Just an awful being.!&lt;

&gt;!I have one question though - What was the sword Rowan threw in the sea at the end? Was it the one he served Maeve with?!&lt;

&gt;!One of my favorite quotes: ""And then I am going to rattle the stars."" - C.S. / A.G.!&lt;

That is all I wanted to say. Thank you for sparing some time to read my post and I have to go now. **Why?**The ending of the book got me on yet another cliffhanger, so I am writing this post and immediately starting it.",I Finished Heir of Fire and Was Blown Away Once Again!,1584627665
