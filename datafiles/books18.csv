books,"There is a spoiler cause my question is about the end of the book. 
Everyone in the city is starting to see again and there is a scene when The Doctor's Wife is looking at the window. She says that now it is her turn to lose the eyesight. Then she looks down. I have a problem with interpretation of that. 
She was the only one who actually saw people's real nature when they lose the order of their world. I think she could lose it because it would be difficult for her to forget what she saw and just live a normal life with people again.

books,"Ernest Hemingway is one of a small class of writers, along with names like Dickens, Austen, and Proust, who can simultaneously terrify and excite a reader. Perhaps most like Jane Austen, we’re often judged not by which of their books we’ve read but whether we’ve read something by them. It’s the mark of a truly great author that one can’t choose a single piece of work, like we might with a Fitzgerald or Salinger.

For me, Hemingway has always been a name that I feared to read. His works seem weighty, almost too highly revered even among “books you must read” lists. The beauty of my reading project is that I must meet head-on writers whose names are new to me as well as those I’ve long avoided tackling through one fear or another.

Published in 1940, For Whom the Bell Tolls is based on Hemingway’s experiences during the Spanish Civil War, which had ended the previous year. Like the earlier A Farewell to Arms, it follows a love story against the backdrop of a major and recent conflict.

For Whom the Bell Tolls tells the story of American Robert Jordan as he fights for guerrillas during the war. Experienced with explosives, Jordan is set to destroy a key bridge but finds the local resistance difficult to work with. He also begins to fall in love with a Spanish girl, Maria, who has lost her family to the fighting.

There are many highlights in this novel, not least of which is enjoying Hemingway’s unique and persuasive style of writing. It sits somewhere between journalism, history and adventure. Yet, no matter how truthful and grounded he writes, Hemingway never forgets the main job of any novel, to entertain. In the hands of a lessor writer, For Whom the Bell Tolls would have been a great adventure story, from Hemingway it’s an epic of war, humanity, love and sacrifice.

In their original review of the novel TIME described For Whom the Bell Tolls as:

1) a great Hemingway love story; 2) a tense story of adventure in war; 3) a grave and sombre tragedy of Spanish peasants fighting for their lives.

This seems to me a fair summary and a clipped-down opinion that Hemingway would have approved of. Unique in my project to date, Hemingway is an author I know that I’ll return to again and again for the sheer quality of his work. The novel is, as all great works are, many things to many people. The discussion around For Whom the Bell Tolls is not whether it’s a masterpiece, but for which of many reasons each reader believes it is.",For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway,1585088460

books,"The idea of reading Jane Austen tends to split readers into those who will read her over and over, and those, like me, who’ve never been interested. Since finishing the novel, I can redefine those two groups as those who will read her over and over and those who really should.

One of the reasons I’m reading through many novels that I’ve never approached before is to create a library for my daughters to grow up with. Today, they’re two and half, and five months old so it will be a while before they open up Emma. I’m already looking forward to our first conversation about Austen and her characters, though it’s more than a decade away. I hope this review still makes sense and still lives somewhere by then.

Emma, the only novel of Austen’s to take its main character as a title, was published in 1815. It follows the romantic life of Emma Woodhouse, a headstrong, smart and wealthy woman who enjoys meddling in the love lives of others but knows very little about herself.

The story of Emma is good and reasonably complicated for something of a farce, but it’s the character that makes the novel so special. Emma portrays herself as a love expert, whilst knowing nothing about her own feelings. She lies to herself more than others and we follow her as she begins to notice and understand her own affections. She’s a fully-drawn character, conflicted and at times harsh, but all the more human for it.

Austen’s eye for social manners, chivalry and class make her something of a chronicler of regency life. Yet, she’s much more than a historian, creating some of the most detailed and realistic characters of her time. Emma should be read by anyone experiencing first or early love as a guide to how we can simultaneously know so much and so little about ourselves. For that matter, Emma seems to know more about our hearts that we ever do, no matter how old or experienced we may think we are.

As John Mullen says in his insightful essay How Jane Austen’s Emma changed the face of fiction, “the narrative was radically experimental because it was designed to share her delusions. The novel bent narration through the distorting lens of its protagonist’s mind.” Read with this insight in mind, Emma is an instruction manual for the love-lost.

Emma was the first Austen novel I’ve read and I’m certain it won’t be the last. I’d recommend it to anyone who’s never been interested in Jane Austen or period fiction. Now I just wish I was closer to the end of my list, so I could read her all over again.",Emma by Jane Austen,1585088257

It was an essay, or a blog post, or a prologue, or something by Umberto Eco where he talked about the process of writing The Name of the Rose.

He told of one time he meet a teenage fan who liked his book despite not understanding it very well, and Umberto then explained that maybe some people liked his book because of the ""atmosphere"" and he wondered if this teenage kid even realized that it was detective story where the detective looses.

Finally he talked about how he sometimes sees the world more as a Medieval man than a modern day man, giving the example of one time his give wanted to show him something, a sun set I think, o a tree, and he didn't pay attention so she got angry, but that later he described something very similar in one of his books, so his wife said: ""you were paying attention after all!"" but he replied ""I wasn't, I just know how it would have looked for a Medieval man who was paying attention"".

books,"So like many other people, after reading a handful of Stephen King, many recommendations had the name of Dean Koontz in it. Last night I finished my first book by him and I found it to be very underwhelming.


It starts off well, the Guardian that intervenes and prevents her from being delivered by an alcoholic doctor was a nice beginning, but the rest...

Part of the book felt kinda rushed and VERY formulaic. Like, a man stalks her, she confronts the man, they get married. The lady then has a kid who ends up being a little genius who, at the age of 8, can perfectly describe what a paradox is and knows what SS stands for.


Some of the parts were also felt like they were ""too perfect to ever happen"" , even in a time travel fi tion book. Like, when Stefan gets shot, she stops by the house of a doctor, who obviously gets out and helps her. I mean, what the fuck? Why on earth would the guy even leave his house like that?


Another thing  that really bugged me is how perfect the things flow. She recovers from a shitty childhood, becomes a writer, sells a fuckton of books and ends up a millionaire. Her lifelong friend also makes big millions just ""for the sake of it"".


I guess that's it. Before reading looking at goodreads, all the reviews were mostly positive and for the most part, I felt like my first Koontz book would be the one that blew me away. As I finished the book, I couldn't help but wonder how great the storyline could've become if things were a little more, should I say, on the ground.


Are the other books by Dean Koontz like this: rushed and underwhelming? I think it's well known that his newer output is downright garbage that he shits forth for the sake of the big bucks. However, by reading one of his older books and feeling very underwhelmed, I feel like the actor can't possibly be even above average.","I've just finished Lightning by Dean Koontz and, uhh....",1585080497

I'm trying to get into reading, but I am having trouble focusing and reading quickly. I was never much of a reader when I was younger, but now it's difficult to start.

My mind is somewhat tangential and causes me to doze off while analyzing what I've just read. I hope that makes sense.

Also, I tend to pause and look up the words I don't understand. This does increase my comprehension but decreases my speed.

1. I never had the chance to read them when I was younger. I knew of the ""Anne of Green Gables"" story when I was younger, but at the time, there was a TV show here in Canada based on the books and it didn't interest me at the time.
2. My family and I didn't really do a lot of shopping for books.
3. It's a great piece of Canadiana in the sense that it all happens in Prince Edward Island and mentions things like the political parties that would have been around at the time and things like that.
4. It's a great piece of what small town living could be to somebody who may not be living in a small town.

books,"I'm currently working on a book, and i'd like to know what you all think. It's called The Ancient Isles, it's about Gina Rogers, a girl who, like everyone else, practices magic. There are five islands in her world, each is a siphoning point for a different kind of magic. It's going to be a hard magic system (i.e. there are strict rules on what magic can or can't do, and they cannot be bent or broken.) and it begins when Gina goes to a high school for magic. yes, that sounds very Harry Potter-esque but Harry Potter was my main inspiration. Anyway, she goes to a school for magic, and meets her new friends after passing the entrance exam. everyone has a magic level, where, like in My Hero Academia, your power is loosely based on luck. Gina, like everyone else who got in, has a high magic level. She's special, yeah, but in this school, being special isn't gonna cut it. There are many classes about different types of magic, from types of potions, to all kinds of spells. There isn't a villain, per se, but there are many forces that interfere with her classes, such as bullies, teachers, spells that lock off a section of the school for renovations, which forces her to take the long way 'round, but there is an antagonist: The Principal. yes, you heard me right. The Principal. The Principal/founder of the school created it in order to siphon magic into the school itself using his special spell: Puppeteer. this spell allows him to take control of any force and redirect it, in this case, the magic. he redirected the magic's siphoning point to the school itself, allowing him to grow in magical prowess as days go by. however, he only did this in order to make the students stronger as well, allowing them to be amazing witches and wizards after graduation because of everything they've been taught as well as the immense power that builds up over time. he's the antagonist because Gina and her two friends are the protagonists, and The Principal's ideas clash with theirs. Gina and her friends believe that if you tamper with magic, it tampers with you (i.e. you can't cheat the system or there will be consequences.) because of the fact that, you know, there are magic GODS, so yeah, but The Principal believes that if you can't break the rules or bend them, there has to at least be a loophole. after all, none of the magic rules set in stone by the gods prevent him from doing this, and it's a good idea in the long run, so why not? Then, we reach the end of the book. Gina's a decade and a half older now, and she just has one thing to say: He brought on the Magic Singularity. Magic became so powerful thanks to The Principal that it couldn't be controlled, and now everyone is too powerful for their own good, so Gina surpressed the power the school being a siphoning point gave her. Now, even if she uses one spell, she risks killing dozens, sometimes thousands depending on the power. what do you think?","So, i read the rules, there's nothing about discussing books we're working on, it seems.",1585058601
