books,"Recently I’ve been looking into getting out of my comfort zone as far as reading goes due to current circumstances. I’ve picked up books such as Meditations, The Art of War and The Last Days of Socrates.

However, these books seem to have no clear narrative or structure and it’s thrown me off.

books,"I had never heard of this book before reading World War Z as a teenager. Max Brooks lists it as his inspiration for WWZ. It had a weird author with an odder name that I had never of before, Studs Terkel. And in the days before kindles and ebooks, I couldn't find the book. Until I did. It was a tattered tome hidden in the back of San Marino's (CA) library sale listed for only 3 dollars. A giant eagle was emblazoned on the cover, sporting the patriotic colors of red, white, and blue. The book was iron grey and thick enough to be armor on the battleship USS Iowa. 

Naturally, I packed it away. It went in the book pile, which became the book box when I moved across the great state of California 4 times. I never opened that box after getting a kindle. 

Fast forward to the pandemic and I'm out on my deck doing my best Marie Kondo-ing and getting rid of anything that ""didn't spark joy"" or straight-up junk. And there it was.

This year, even before the pandemic, was the year of taking on the tomes. I've finished ""Way of Kings,"" ""The Silk Road,"" ""Hamilton,""  ""Dune-Dune Messiah-Children of Dune"" in the past two-three months. All are trash to this great big hunk of a novel. And I loved most of those books.

WW2 has an awesome place in American history. Yes, it was world-wide and America bore relatively little of the brunt. Yet, it is so embedded in our culture. It was the catalyst for the great American 20th century. Upward movement, the Middle Class, American dominance at land, air, sea, and nuclear weapons all were because of WW2. I am simplifying the calculus massively, but you talk to any American about WW2 and it's a source of pride. 

I've read war books before. I read ""The Great War"" by John Keegan, every Stephen Ambrose book when I was a teenager, and more than a few about Vietnam. They are all concerned with the battles and soldiers involved. Tactics, Political gamesmanship, and economies pushed to the limits are on display as well. ""The Good War"" is a sharp change of pace.

""The Good War"" is about the little people. The Marine machine gunner turned Navy chaplain discharged after serving his country for sole being gay. The conscientious objector discriminated and  locked up for disagreeing with the way, having to fight for his civil rights back. The Japanese who called the US home who were locked up, denied entry. The man who married a Japanese woman and has to come to terms with his racist past. The girl who married too young to a drunk womanizing officer. The Admiral fighting to reign in the military-industrial complex. The Italian architect who saw his neighborhood change in less than a decade. The Kentucky women/Rosie's who were blacklisted because they asked for water and not coca-cola in their factories.

Was the war really ""good?"" Why do we repeat the same mistakes over and over? Why do the best intentions become tarnished? All questions with no easy answers. Terkel doesn't offer answers or easy answers and neither do his interviewees. 

A problem that I've had with history and fantasy is that they are overly concerned with the big men of history. Every character has an impact on the story at large. Everything good and right has a good and right answer. The characters all are directed related or have access to the shot callers, royalty, or spymasters. Clear sober thinking always wins out. ""The good war"" was a dunk into a freezing pool on an oppressively hot day: refreshing and makes you question why the hell you jumped in the first place.

I'm reminded of our current state of affairs. Certain American leaders have shirked their responsibilities and it's people who need to take care of one another. Divisions are being exacerbated like faulting on the California coast. You can't help but look at the news but feel small. ""The Good War"" helps that. It doesn't matter if you aren't a politician, captain of industry, or some influencer. YOU matter. YOUR story matters.

books,"I guess it would be better to start of with an example;
I'm from Poland. As most of you might imagine, down here the ""Witcher"" saga is rather big (I know. Shocker). The saga is so big in the current culture that to be honest it's rather hard to find a person who didn't hear of it, and even harder to find a someone ""into books"" who didn't read thru at least one volume of it.
Easy to say, ""the Witcher"" is basically a cult classic down here so much that it made me realize how much certain media actually shape certain cultures.

books,"This is a follow-up to one of my previous posts on here which I since have deleted because I want to expand on it. I talked about how I felt like I could not read as well as I used to. I was going through this spell for a couple weeks where it was like I could read and recognise the words that I could see but they had no meaning, I had to read the same sentence 2-3 times to even understand what it meant. I had been going through this for a couple weeks and it was kind of distressing because the lack of focus kind of came out of nowhere and I didn't know why. I first noticed this problem when watching tv shows or movies with subtitles, I often didn't understand what they meant fast enough before they disappeared and it caused me to have to rewind to re-read them. It severely hindered the viewing experience and causes me to lose enjoyment. Prior to this I could normally read subtitles really fast to the point where it takes me a couple glances to understand it fully and I could focus on the visuals. The only reason I need subtitles is so that in a noisy environment I could understand what was being said. But now it was like i could not focus on the subtitles even though I could see them perfectly well with no vision problems, it was like i could not decipher the meaning of the word. 

So then I noticed the same thing when reading novels and stuff -  the last novel I read was Animal Farm which I immensely enjoyed but it was a little hindered because I often had to re-read sentences to get their meaning and understand what was going on. Even in a completely peaceful and quiet environment sentences felt like pictures of letters to me. Again, prior to this I could read novels perfectly fine my whole life. 

I suffer from generalised and social anxiety, which most likely has played a factor into this but I didn't have a single problem prior to a few months ago. I highly doubt this is ADHD because I basically have no other symptoms of it, I can have a lot of focus when doing almost anything else. I think this is the onset of general stress.

When I posted about this previously someone had suggested heart coherence which I immediately jumped onto because I felt very anxious that this was beginning to lessen my enjoyment of life overall in such a short and sudden period of time I tried deep breathing for 10 minutes twice a day. This really helped calm me down very quickly. I didn't expect results straight away but I kept doing it and I did notice that it became easy to process things much better, I could read much quicker without having to re-read often, so I became hopeful. 

However as I think more about my issue now, I feel it has turned into something different now. I can now understand what I read without feeling like I need to decipher it by re-reading it, but now it feels like I am literally forgetting everything that I read during the process of reading it. I can be reading a long sentence and forget what the beginning of the sentence said by the time I got to the end. This doesn't happen with a short sentence. Now I get very anxious about remembering what I read to the point that I re-read in fear of having forgotten something. When I watch something like anime in subtitles I often focus so much on trying to remember what the characters have said previously that I dont pay attention to what they are saying in the present so it makes it less enjoyable

This is mainly because I've realised most of the books that I personally enjoy are from that century, and also because I believe that anyone who is interested in beginning to read more 'serious' or 'classic' literature would be well to do with much of what is contained in the previous century. Also I just like the idea of going 'I wonder what was going on in 1920' and picking up a couple books from that year. So far I've just finished the first quarter;

books,"I'll often spend ages looking for my next book, but whenever I find an intriguing candidate then see one negative review I change my mind. I think this comes from my fear of committing to a long book then realizing I don't enjoy it when I'm halfway through. I don't want to invest my time and money into a novel and have it not pay out. For example, I've heard so much good about Catch-22, but I end up wondering why it fails to reach an average of &gt;4 stars on GoodReads, and why there are multiple well-received reviews from people saying they couldn't finish the book.

books,"I am a big sci-fi buff and I often find the general recommendations for new readers to be slanted towards books like Dune or Blindside. Both are great works of science fiction but for various reasons I could see a new reader being put off by them.

I would always recommend Spin as a great starter book to science fiction. It has a fascinating premise, well written characters, and the near future “could happen tomorrow” setting isn’t disorienting for new readers. The book is a love letter to the genre and if I wanted someone to expand their horizons it’s what I would recommend.

books,"Spoilers! 

Just finished this book and had some thoughts. Like many people, I splurged on the pricey hardcover given the thousands of 5-star reviews and accolades from notable writers and was left wishing I had just gotten the kindle version since it's a pretty quick read and I don't really see myself reading it again. Going through the amazon reviews and posts on here, it seems readers are either in the majority of loving it or in a minority of strongly disliking it. I found myself in the lukewarm middle. I thought the writing itself was solid and I actually did have some sympathy for the main characters. I predicted the ending with about 100 pages to go, but dismissed it thinking it was too ridiculous. The timeline split didn't really rectify that sense of disappointment. Now, I know there needs to be a certain suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy fiction, but I think that knowing the wave of glowing reviews behind it prepared me for one of the most gripping stories I'd ever plunge into. I still think it's a decent book and will make a great film, but I would not have pegged it for a knockout bestseller. 

One other point I haven't seen brought up about the end of this story was the sense of disappointment in the revelation of the character of the ""protagonist."" I had read up a bit about the author beforehand and knew that he worked in psychotherapy and used it to deal with his own mental health. There are parts of the book with convincing depictions of depression and anxiety and I was uplifted to read how he'd found a professional who helped him out of the dark where so many people find themselves trapped at some point in life. The ending essentially means that his years of psychotherapy were fruitless as he ended up being the most dark and twisted character in the story. It also muddled the altruistic sentiments of the narrative pre-twist. I didn't feel like I hadn't been paying close enough attention, but rather that I was now reading a character who was completely different from the one presented to me for the first 300 pages of the book. The premise is still compelling, but to have a trained psychotherapist behave like this and inflict trauma on people without expecting the repercussions to be severe just didn't quite leave me feeling shocked and excited. I'm not a huge fan of the unreliable narrator but this was especially disappointing to me and I can imagine the author's real life therapists texting him ""um WTF.""

I don't know if I am alone in saying this, but it was a hard read for me at first, as I would read the same pages over and over and still have difficulty understanding the message clearly. But everytime I re-read it, I feel like I have unlocked hidden messages. For me, this is the one book that keeps on giving. There are so many things I took away from this book.

My memory is sketchy, but the key details I remember are:
- Story involved reincarnation of the protagonists over several lifetimes 
- Lots of flash backs to the previous incarnations, or maybe each novel was based on a different incarnation of the characters
- Story was centered on two main characters, male and female

books,"Hello everyone. I just finished this novel yesterday, and very much enjoyed it.

The story is framed around a pair of young girls who go missing on a geographically secluded Russian peninsula. But the story isn’t too focused on the disappearance and subsequent search—the book takes a turn after the first chapter and tells the story of a handful of women whose lives are affected, in big or small ways, by the girls’ disappearance. Each point of view has only one chapter, and many times the point of view ends before the character’s conflict is dealt with (although some are tied up or hinted at in other chapters from a different point of view). Julia does a nice job of presenting these vastly different women from different stages of life in a way that is believable and entertaining, and without getting too much into spoiler territory yet, the issues dealt with range from the loss of loved ones, to the effects of dangerous or traditional masculinity on women, to being bored with life, to reconciling differences between how you and others see loved ones—just to name a few. A lot of it is very relatable and easy to understand.

But while it isn’t your typical thriller/mystery story, it does eventually give a satisfying and suspenseful climax, and I flew through the last fifty pages. I highly recommend.

Marked spoilers follow for anyone who’s finished the story:

&gt;!How did you feel about Lada’s chapter in hindsight, knowing that Yegor, the man she almost ended up sleeping with, was the kidnapper? !&lt;

&gt;!Who was the woman living with Yegor in the house? In the final chapter, the girls hear yelling and wonder if it’s ‘the woman’ and Yegor arguing. It’s possible that they may have been talking about Lilia, but I got the impression that Lilia was trapped in a room in the same conditions they were, so it’s likely that she wasn’t able to be out arguing with Yegor. The way Alyona speculates makes it seem like this woman and Yegor argue all the time (obviously the argument and yelling they hear at the end is likely police coming to rescue them, but there seems to be a history of Yegor arguing with a woman... maybe I misunderstood). !&lt;",Has anyone read Disappearing Earth by Julia Phillips?,1588605006
