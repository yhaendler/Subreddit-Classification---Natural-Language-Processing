I became curious about this after I recently read Starship Troopers by Heinlein, and it reminded me of a lot of books that I have previously read. I felt like I was hearing the book's future echos the whole time. I often felt that scenes, plots, and concepts were very close to ones I have seen in other books. For example, the bugs seem almost identical to the Formics in Orson Scott Card's works, but I found a [post](http://www.hatrack.com/research/questions/q0029.shtml) that's supposed to be by Orson Scott Card, saying he never even read Starship Troopers. The tube drops from space in Starship troopers are just like those in the Red Rising series by Pierce Brown, and many aspects of it felt similar to the Old Man's War series by John Scalzi. These books all came after the 1959 Starship Troopers, so they could have all been influenced directly or indirectly.

books,"First thing I'll get out of the way - it's not quite like the Game of Thrones. It's more traditional fantasy. There's a bit more of a young-adult vibe.

I don't have a problem with that or want to scare off potential readers... the books are enjoyable. 

What it means in practical terms is... there's absolutely no sex, and no swearing. There's some violence, which can get graphic, and I think that's a just a funny quirk of USA culture. We're OK with describing someone's head exploding, but uncomfortable describing someone's nipples getting sucked.

There are times where I feel like this becomes the proverbial elephant in the room. A young woman sits on a guy's lap, kisses him for a while, then makes some comment like ""let's not get distracted"". Or a character is described as ""swearing colorfully"". This did bug me at times, because there's always going to be less impact in hearing something like ""he made a lewd suggestion"" vs. [something like this](https://youtu.be/sjSMAlwlqWw?t=82)(1:22). There's also just a whiff of Twilight in there, as we have a young wallflower who suddenly becomes the (literal) belle of the ball. Some paragraphs are devoted to her picking out gowns and realizing that all the popular rich people are talking about the mysterious pretty new girl.

-----

OK, so that being said... here's a quick rundown of the plot, spoiler-free.

We learn about the world (known as the Final Empire) through the eyes of Vin, a timid teenage girl who's part of a thieving crew. They live in harsh, medieval society with strict class lines - you're nobility, or you're skaa. Life for the skaa is shit - they're peasants and slaves. Our first glimpse of their lives bring to mind images from US history: barebacked workers on a plantation, being whipped by an overseer on horseback.

This system has been in place for 1,000 years... created and enforced by the rarely-seen Lord Ruler. He's a mysterious god-king who rules from his keep in the capital city, and lets his Obligators (bureaucrats, basically) handle the day-to-day tasks of enforcing the law and facilitating trade. If there's a problem, he has a large army/police force at his disposal, and a handful of deadly Inquisitors. 

Inquisitors, by the way, are a terrifying (and gruesomely badass) concept: grim, powerful wizards with [massive spikes driven through their eye sockets](https://www.17thshard.com/forum/uploads/gallery/category_4/gallery_10646_4_17833.jpg), who somehow still live and can see. Think Agent Smith meets Voldemort.

It's made clear that for skaa, there's no fighting the system. They can't beat an army when they don't have weapons or training, and even if they could... the nobility can inherit specific magical abilities through their bloodlines... e.g. the ability to move metal, which effectively turns coins into bullets. Inquisitors possess magic that's even stronger, and the Lord Ruler's got unique abilities that are stronger yet, and he cannot be killed. So the situation is thoroughly hopeless.

Naturally, there are people who believe otherwise. 

Enter Kelsier, the charismatic leader of a more heavy-duty thieving crew, who has accepted a job from the skaa underground to topple the final empire. Ostensibly they do this for a big payoff - Kelsier spent part of his life mining the precious rare metal Atium, before escaping from the pits, and is convinced the Lord Ruler has a huge stash of the stuff. But he's also taken on this job because he hates the system, and has a personal grudge with the Lord Ruler. And Kelsier might just have a chance, because he and his friends are some of the rare commoners with access to magic. Kelsier subcontracts Vin's crew, and she gets dragged into a world of conflict and magic that she never even knew existed.

-----

To describe the later books would somewhat require spoiling the ending fo the first book, so I'll just say that their plan has all sorts of unintended consequences... there's a reason the Lord Ruler's empire has been stable for a so long, and we find out his role goes beyond just preserving the class system. Threatening him, indirectly threatens the whole world.

----

Things I liked: 

• The magic system is interesting and complex. It has fairly specific rules. The ability to do anything is inherited, and you either get one specific magic ability (out of 10 or so) or you get them all. Only a handful of people get these powers, almost exclusively nobility, and they won't know about it until they 'snap'... meaning they go through some huge trauma that awakens the ability.

Using these powers consume metal, which is ground into powder and ingested in a liquid. The necessary metals range from common-as-dirt steel to incredibly-rare atium. Some abilities are incredibly useful (increased strength, speed, agility, and healing... all from tin) and some... not so much (e.g. gold lets you see the past). 

Magic is never really ""free"" and the Allomancers who use it must manage their metal reserves carefully, and be aware of negative side effects. The most powerful players in the books, are the ones who can somewhat break the rules or discover a new way of using their abilities.

• There's a lot of hidden lore that gets gradually revealed over the course of 3 books... the source of the Lord Ruler's power, where magic comes from, the creation of certain magical races, the role of the metals, and some alternate methods of using magic. There's a lot of interesting backstory that keeps the book from being just ""good guys with magic vs. bad guys with magic"".

• The characters are memorable and distinct. You can tell when a book's characters need work when you read their name and go ""which one was that again?""... that's not an issue here. Kelsier is charming and sort of swashbuckling, but is quick (maybe too quick) to kill nobility and make ruthless choices. Vin is furtive and wary... her life has been one of privation, beatings, and betrayals. She trusts nobody, but part of her wants to. Marsh is grim, humorless. He has none of the charm of his brother. He tried for years to enlist Kelsier in the skaa rebellion, and now that it's finally happened, he doesn't trust Kelsier's motives.

• We go through some plot twists and the author shows he's willing to kill off major characters. It keeps things fresh.

• Just when you think they're winning, you realize there's more work to do, and the hardships have just begun. The author does a good job of making sure things never feel too easy, and manages to avoid abusing that sort of deus ex machina you see in other fantasy novels: ""and then the hero drew on their power really hard, harder than ever, and blew up the bad guy"". The good guys lose, get hurt, and are forced to run.

• We get some small hints that this world might be somehow related to our own, but the author avoids some common fantasy tropes. It isn't alternate reality medieval england. It isn't the distant future. The sky is red. The plants are brown. There's perpetual mist at night. There aren't guns, magic swords, or steampunk trains. There's giants, but no elves or dwarven blacksmiths or dragons. The world is unique.

-----------------------------

Things I disliked:

• Sometimes the author does that thing where characters seem to be made deliberately stupid... missing stuff that is obvious to the reader... so it can feel like a great triumph when they figure it out. For example, at one point Vin is stuck with a servant she doesn't want. The servant did something that bothers her, and she takes it out on them... speaking rudely to them, trying to ditch them, calling them by their race instead of their name, etc. When the servant responds in a less-than-enthusiastic way, she asks ""why do you hate me?"". Duh.

There's also a key revelation about how some powerful magic works, and the main characters take forever to figure it out. In fact, one of the important ones NEVER quite figures it out, someone else has to 'show' them. I gotta keep it vague for spoiler purposes, but just know that if you read this series, there will be times you're gonna want to yell at the characters. At times, it's like that feeling you get when the dumb disposable characters in a horror movie go into the dark haunted cabin. ""OH COME ON!""

• The books can get bogged down in boring discussions of politics, or warfare. Maybe they're just boring to me. I think it's more interesting when the characters are moving, like they're on a quest or exploring a new area. It really slows down when the main characters are at their base in the capital city, and dealing with problems like supply lines, lack of food, elections, etc. It's clear their fate hinges on some crucial magic stuff, some hidden ancient lore. So all that mundane stuff feels like it doesn't advance the plot. Of course, the same could easily be said about GoT.

• There's a ton of time spent on the protagonists, not so much invested in the antagonists. The Lord Ruler is not fleshed out, he's just this ethereal, invincible guy with an interesting backstory. The backstory is explained in bits and pieces, as if we're given a handful of sentences from a history book. But it would have been nice if we a switched perspectives to the past, and got to live through his rise to power and great betrayal. There's another evil force at play too... something that influences the lord ruler... and that force is given a personality. The personality is, unfortunately, straight anime-villain. 'oh child, did you really think you could defeat me?'. There's a whole mythology here (including a powerful force for good) and all we're really told is this god-force destroys because that's its nature. There's a powerful force for good, too, and that force is given no personality at all. I feel a little cheated, there.

tl;dr: despite the occasional young-adulty vibe, which I might not have noticed 20 years ago, this is a pretty interesting series with some care put into the plot, the lore, and the role of magic in their society.","[Review] I was recommended Brandon Sanderson, as someone who enjoyed GoT.

books,"I never understood why Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye was relegated as immature or a brat. I identified with him as a teen and never grew out of it. I mean -- I get how he sounds, and how bombastic, dare i say exaggerated,  his vernacluure seems, with the ""Phony's"", ""That Killed Me's"" and ""Got a bang out of that's"". From point of view is to the wage-earning working-adult, he's literally speaking another language, dashing words with emotions that seem too forward to the man who has learned how to sacrifice. Even if so, I never felt that Caulfield was immature. Then i came across this excerpt:

# “Let me repeat. I have not read all the work of  this present generation of writing. I have not had time yet. So I must  speak only of the ones I do know. I am thinking now of what I rate the  best one, Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, perhaps because this one  expresses so completely what I have tried to say. A youth, father to  what will—must—someday be a man, more intelligent than some and more  sensitive than most, who—he would not even have called it by instinct  because he did not know he possessed it because God perhaps had put it  there, loved man and wished to be a part of mankind, humanity, who tried  to join the human race and failed. To me, his tragedy was not that he  was, as he perhaps thought, not tough enough or brave enough or  deserving enough to be accepted into humanity. His tragedy was that when  he attempted to enter the human race, there was no human race there.  There was nothing for him to do save buzz, frantic and inviolate, inside  the glass wall of his tumbler, until he either gave up or was himself,  by himself, by his own frantic buzzing, destroyed.” 

#  -William Faulkner

Faulkner expressed that disquiet I've come to recognize and now embody now, which i could only stay witness to as waves of critics, be it teen, young-adult or old, lashed out along the lines ""You'll come to see how immature and ignorant Caulfied is when you grow up.""

2) Just when you think everything is going to be fine, it´s gonna get messed up again

3) The plot points he comes up with are just insane, the imagination is unbelievable

4) Many characters have their own crazy backstories but easy to follow and don´t lose focus from the main story

5) He mixes things that actually happened in the world with made up stuff that perfectly fit

6) Everything just comes together perfectly and it is so satisfying

7) Some witty lines and humor makes the quite long book light

   As soon as I finished the book, I found it interesting that for the first time there was some sparkles of hope in the end when the prisoner was longing to finish his time in prison and go back to his life and perhaps a new one. I don't know if the writer did that so it won't be an absolute misery ending, or it was just a temporary moment that will take a different direction if the story carried on, which happend a lot in the book.

   And when it comes to theories. My first one is the moment Raskolnikof goes to a bar and heard two people,one of them is a student, talking about murdering the same person he was thinking about. Which is a huge coincidence that I doubt. So what I think is that dialogue between these two person is actullay an inner one in his mind or he just imagines it. And what made me more certaint about it is that later on he says to Razoumikhin that he might be imagining the most of events round him. Of course that was after the murder, but he was struggling even before it.
  
    For the second one, and that is when he is in prison, gets sick and starts dreamig about the world getting messed up. And as soon as he gets better everything turns to be "" happier"". He goes back to work in the prison's yard as he finds it empty with Sofia getting better too and meets him there. So what I think is that was all from his imagination too, he actullay dies after getting sick and he never gets better.

    In the end, I want to say that I really enjoyed this amazing book and I'm glad that I read it as it made me think about it a lot. Of course these are just some modest thoughts that could be wrong as I might have missed some events that prove otherwise.

books,"I don't give a damn if this post gets downvoted into oblivion. The book just sucked. It especially turns to crap when (Spoiler ahead) the story fast forwards 13 years after Catherine's death. It wasnt great before that point but it had engaging elements in its first half. 

And to think that it's been recommended to me so much... I honestly can't fathom how anyone can think this book is good. My god. 

The characters are downright awful. Especially Heathchliff who never fails to make my blood boil. The story is a massive bore. 

 You learn about how Linton and Catherine's (the second generation) love story would play out WHILE YOU'RE ON THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE 10 CHAPTERS SUBPLOT. Where is any discovery in that? (please don't come at me with a hackneyed line it's not about the destination its about the journey. Well the journey is awful as well in this context) 

And before you accuse me of being some kind of a yokel who can't appreciate ""high"" art such as this. Know that before this book I read Jane Eyre and I found to it be great actually. To be clear it had its flaws but compared to this piece of crap that book was a masterpiece.

books,"I have been searching and searching for this obscure book. The writer wasn’t too popular and I believe he died in a sanitarium. The book was written either late 1800s or Bearkat early 1900s. The writer of the book was having schizophrenic episodes more and more frequent later in the story, blurring the lines between his reality and the book.

The book is a supernatural horror, the narrator is having hallucinations of some ghostly spirit haunting him in his sleep and he believes it came from a big ship at the docks. He tries getting help from a friend of his that his a doctor and it doesn’t work.

The story ends with him going to the asylum, happening while he is also being taken to an asylum. I don’t believe HE published the book since he literally couldn’t.

books,"I know it is unlikely that it would’ve been a master work in literature, but it also seems like a really difficult concept to screw up.. 

It has been several months since I read it so I’ll probably miss some things, but here are some points that are lodged in my brain this cool, calm morning. 

Right off the bat it seems like a glaring plot hole that the protagonist absolutely lives for the game but apparently sucks really badly at it- he’s extremely low level despite it being his calling- I get the whole ‘pay-to-win’ idea but it’s preposterous that he would spend every waking moment in the Oasis and have nothing to show for it in game, and furthermore that he would STILL LIKE THE GAME.

It’s also clunky and bizarre that the Oasis is bigger than a game, hosting huge swaths of economy etc, but if you die it’s... what, game over? It’s never really clear what game over means... but it sure seems implied that... like... you just have to stop playing forever? Has the author never played a single game beyond an Atari? Respawns aren’t a thing, and an extra life is some massive secret Easter egg that only he found? 

And it’s really strange that he works out, gets fit and buff in the early middle of the story, and it never comes up again. It would have maybe been a cheesy device, sure, but why isn’t that used in an epic real-world escape from assassins or something. Or at least when he meets Artemis he could be a hot-body.. why even bring it up? It’s like the author just forgot about it. 


There’s 1000 things wrong with this book, but I’m out of breath already and having trouble remembering some of them- I may come back with an edit or in the comments. 
I know it’s a popcorn book, but still, it really seems to have no depth, terrible world building, unlikable characters, and a clunky broken plot. I have no nostalgia for 80s games, but I tried hard to see past it and not judge people who sing the book’s praises; I absolutely cannot see why people seem to have liked it beyond being, no offense, suckered in by endless references of yesteryear’s game culture (which was maybe the only part of the book done well, but that’s just not enough)

books,"I wanted to try some more challenging books, and someone suggested *The Sound and the Fury* to me, which is argued as Faulkner's masterpiece. I'm about 60 pages in so far.

I've never read Faulkner before. I went into this book cold, not knowing *anything* about it.

I got 10 pages in and was almost ready to give up - I could only assume that Benjy was either a small child, blind (because the style of writing for the character lacked much observation about his surroundings), or mentally disabled. I picked up pretty quickly that the *italics* had signified some change in the setting - but I had no idea how drastic. I could not figure out who any of the characters were as Benjy only uses their names and the only hint of their relationship is through conversation. 

I felt so over my head and presumed that I had the literary depth of a wet nap.

Eventually I just had to go online do a quick google search to find out that this dude is, in fact, mentally disabled and can't find himself in time any better than a sane man in a house of mirrors - so what I'm reading is a pretty bold attempt of Faulkner to take the reader into the garbled stream of consciousness of this character who is spinning back and forth through 33 some odd years of his existence, sometimes switching time periods up to THREE TIMES in one page like he's a Top Gun pilot of narrative timelines, recklessly going FULL *danger zone* along the story.

This means that Faulkner had to painfully keep track of where Benjy went in the story, which parts of the story he wanted to expose, and only give subtle clues to the reader about where they were.

I'm glad I finally got that context - it makes the book more enjoyable as I'm now slowly learning this world that Benjy occupies. This feels like a book that Faulkner intentionally wanted his readers to read more than once. 

I have no idea how any one could approach this book cold - like what the hell was the response when it first came out? People must have hated it, then overtime saw the painstaking effort Faulkner put in to writing this point of view. 

I keep imagining that when his publisher got the first copy of this book, they must have sat there and thought *Fuck Bill, chill out*.

I'll also never trust italics again. I'm so excited to see how this all ends up.","Just started reading ""The Sound and the Fury"" with no context - Benjy is a fucking trip",1582123897

books,"When I was in elementary school our teacher taught us about an author and/or illustrator that was one of the wealthiest of his time.  


I remember in the story, that he was a poor boy working at a shop, but brought forth an idea to the owner (or something).  


He said that he could write, and he could make it as a writer, but the shop owner laughed at him, and said he was too stupid to entertain others.   


But the boy said,""But you see, I have an idea! Just like the paper, we can release the story in short books, a few chapters at a time if you may. At the end of each volume, we'll have something crazy happen, to be continued into the next volume! Everyone will be sure to buy each volume.""  


I'm unsure if this was just a story, or if it's based on a real person/event, but the only other thing I remember is that, they started the series as paper back novels, and eventually they began releasing hard cover versions with 2-4 novels in each one or something, yet, they would give you a discount if you turned in your paper back versions.  


They would then take the pages out of the paper back novels and use them in the hard cover novels to save money, and I think they even did it again with a limited big book leather bound version of the series too.

I did not expect that at all before reading. Shows how faithful adaptations tend to be (or maybe I only watched the tamer ones?)
