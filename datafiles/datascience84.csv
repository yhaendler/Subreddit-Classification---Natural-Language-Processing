datascience,"Let's take an example, I have a master model Mv1 and I deployed it for so my users can use this pretrained model directly on their systems. Now I also have an active learning mechanism by which every users models gets improved based on their inputs and gives then personalised experience, let's says after a few active learning steps the model is now Mv1.4 . Now I release a new update to the master model say Mv2 which is more efficient, Now I want my users to use this new master version.

So how can I have them use this new version Mv2 plus I also don't want them to loose all those active learning that the model Mv1 learned to become Mv1.4 . 

How can I merge or like preserve the active learning.
Like I want a new model like Mv2.4 which would be a addition of Mv1.4 and Mv2. 

I would love to hear about your thoughts on this.

If you don't get the question, I will try to make it more simple.

For a real life example, Google uses many models to provide us their service and these models in turn learns from our interactions and gives us user specific results , so in time when Google wants to release a new update to the models, how does it keeps those user specific learning in the new update",How can we maintain the user specific active learning between different model version/updates.,1614464415

datascience,"I am a data scientist and have a pipeline that usually consists of SQL DB -&gt;&gt;&gt; slide deck of insights. I have access to Python and R and I am equally skilled in both, but I always find myself falling back to the beautiful Tidyverse of dplyr, stringr, pipes and friends over pandas. The real game changer for me is the %&gt;% pipe operator, it's wonderful to work with. I can do all preprocessing in one long chain without making a single variable, while in pandas I find myself swamped with df, df_no_nulls, df_no_nulls_norm etc. etc. (INB4 choose better variable names but you get my point). The best part about the chain is that it is completely debuggable as it's not nested. The group_by/summarise/mutate/filter grammar is really really good at it's job in comparison to pandas, particularly mutate. The only thing I wish R had that Python has is list comprehension, but there are a ton of things I wish pandas did better that R's Tidyverse does. 

Of course, all the good ML frameworks are written in Python that blows R out of the water further down the pipeline.

I'm currently working as a junior data scientist at a Fortune 500 company with nice benefits. The company I got an offer is a small company with around 100 employees. 

Current company provides me:

- boss from hell. I ended up seeing a psychiatrist after having my first panic attack thanks to my boss who loves micromanaging, to be emotional, to withhold  information from team members, to be biggest bottleneck of the entire department, untrustworthy, accusing, gives no feedbacks, gossips &amp; badmouths, constantly changes priorities, blames other people all the time. Just imagine Donald Trump, but much less popular and less eloquent
- jr data scientist position
- decent fringe benefits
- small DS team (6-7 members), not very functional because of the poor leadership and office politics


New company offers me:

- better title (senior data scientist)
- slight rise in salary (+10%)
- more interesting projects 
- DS team with 6-7
- many uncertainties 

My parter, who is much smarter and rational than me, told me that this might be bad for my career advancements and I'd better stick to my current job until I find a new position at a decent company

Now after a few years of experience, having a stable FT job, and entering a hot market, it is weird getting call backs a few days after submitting an application, being able to turn down interest or interviews, or evening naming a higher salary requirement.

Overall, I'm seeing this passive job search as having the opportunity to choose and think about what I'd like my next career step to be. Obviously this is an extremely lucky spot to be in. But having all the choice does make it a bit more difficult to navigate -- especially when sifting through FT, contract-to-hire, contractor positions, as well as start-ups, FAANGS and other tech companies, and big companies just starting there data science programs.

I'd like to have a ready set of questions to ask recruiters and interviewers to quickly categorize an opportunity as something I'd like to pursue, or something I pass on.

datascience,"Hey all,

Hoping to get advice from your experience. My org recently made me ""data guy""and asked me to extract insights from the data. So, that's what I've been struggling for 5 months already.

For now I did a lot of data collection and data engineering, and it's still ongoing! 

I created several data applications, so myself, my teammates, and other folks from the department can explore the data they produce. But those data applications didn't find much usage by users and support from the management.

I did some adhoc report requests where management asked me to provide some numbers about past performance, so I gave them quite easily as I wrote a lot of python functions and now every data manipulation is quite easy for most common scenarios.

I prototyped some predictive models and will be ready to integrate them into the department's systems. But again not sure if I'll get support and those systems will prioritize stories for that.

So, in the end I'm lost. I think I did a lot of stuff a data scientist is supposed to do but haven't got any tangible user-touching outcome. What else should I try to do? Or should I try to move somewhere else where managers have better understanding of what data can give them?

datascience,"Work as a ""data scientist"" in the financial services industry. Work broadly involves:

1. Meeting with business to understand problem
2. Find the data and build data pipelines using SQL/python
3. Do analysis and build baseline model in python/jupyter notebook
4. Once a workflow is established, I put everything in python scripts, and run automated hyperparameter/model selection/etc. searches, and standardized result outputs to find the best model. Also helps with reproducibility.
5. Present and communicate results to business
6. Develop final model package and data pipelines to deploy it in our production platforms (using OOP concepts like python classes, software engineering principles like pylint, pytest, CICD pipelines etc.)

Looking at the above sequence of steps, most of it is data engineering, reproducible analysis development, and then production engineering.

Starting to feel like this is more similar to software engineering/development of a data or model ""product"", rather than ""data science"". Thoughts?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT\_1 to clarify: For #2 the data pipelines are more figuring out the different data sources and combining the data that is applicable to our problem. eg. there might be 5 tables with 100 fields, and so narrowing down which ones we should use, and creating a SQL/python pipeline for that. We have dedicated data teams that maintain these upstream tables/data sources.

For #3, #4 this includes feature engineering and applying a range of statistical or machine learning methods, to figure out which one best solves the problem (eg. time series vs regression model) -&gt; this being the unknown and iterative part that can take considerable time; which is the ""core DS"" work I think.

And #5 &amp; #6 actually ensuring what we develop delivers business value, otherwise the model is just a thought experiment lol..

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT\_2 for some historical context on the question: When I started out 5+ years ago, we were using SAS to run regressions, and I'd used STATA in my grad degree. So python, open source software and this whole engineering stuff is something that I have picked up along the way.
