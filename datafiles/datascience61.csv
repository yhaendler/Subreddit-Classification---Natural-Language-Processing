datascience,"Hey guys, 

I am a fourth-year student at the University of Calgary studying business analytics and finance and I am very strongly considering doing a Masters in Data Science from a University here or potentially in the States. I wanted to know what you guys thought would be reputable programs for me to pursue and would me to work with ML, AI and predictive analytics after I graduate. I didn't know I wanted to data science until earlier this year and I find it intensely fun and engaging (bye - bye law school I guess). 

I have a good academic average of 3.9 GPA and I have a considerable amount of experience with R (I absolutely love R), SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, and RapidMiner. I am currently looking for a 12-month position in the analytics field in Calgary so hopefully, I will have some work experience in the field before I apply. I want to get more advanced knowledge of this field after I finish my undergrad and I am looking for what is considered the top programs in Canada or the States (dependent on the tuition). The two programs that really piqued my interest were the MDSAI program at Waterloo and UBC MDS (especially the computational linguistics one). I wanted to get input on which programs will be likely to admit me as I don't have a pure STEM background and which ones would be the best to equip me to work with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies. 

Alternatively, I was thinking about delaying graduation a bit to take some advanced stats courses to better prepare me for the MDS program (Waterloo seems to have very strict requirements for entry).  The classes would relate to linear regression, stats in R, and statistical experimentation along with linear algebra and multivariable calculus. Is there potential to do an MS in Stats that would offer more lucrative opportunities if I choose to go this path?

I've recently started pursuing a masters program in Data Science while working part time for my already Data Science job (been working as a DS for 2.5 years now) and I'm seriously struggling to find the motivation to stick with it.

I mostly started because of pressure from my parents (my dad calling me at least once a week and asking when I will finally get a masters degree) and because I thought it would open some doors for working internationally.

It's two months into the program now, and with working part-time and then Uni in the evenings, it's draining my life energy. I would much rather spend some time applying myself creatively, taking dance and art classes (as far as the pandemic allows), but I do not have the time during most of the week and then on my days off I'm either supposed to study or I'm just too exhausted to get off the couch.

Everyone says that it's only a two year program and I should just stick it out, but honestly it's making me lose interest in both my job AND the degree. It's just so much sitting in front of a PC being productive in the eyes of capitalism and there's like a million things I would rather do. But yeah I'm having second thoughts if not having a masters will make my future career more difficult or whatever.

I have an option to combine my econ major with statistics.

I was wondering how valuable it is to combine major in econ/stat compare to graduate straight from economics major and adding a certificate in data analytics from a local college.

I'm torn between the two because I would have to spend fairly similar additional time and money on doing both combine major or a certificate.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is

If it cost same money and time, what would be a better option for landing a first data analytics job?

datascience,"Flookup is a suite of functions for data cleaning inside Google Sheets by using advanced fuzzy matching techniques. It can be used to:

* Search for and match data regardless of whether it contains typos.
* Highlight and remove duplicates duplicates even if the data has spelling variations.
* Calculate the percentage similarity between strings.
* Extract unique values from any column based on percentage similarity.

Because of its versatility, Flookup can be instructed to return the best match, the next best match, etc. until the minimum percentage similarity is reached. This feature avoids weaknesses other fuzzy matching algorithms have because it Keeps the power in your hands, and **you are the best judge of which data matches and which does not**.

Another great feature Flookup has is that it can combine lookup values. This is particularly helpful when your data has too many similar strings and you want to add extra information to your lookup value to increase the specificity of your query.

Finally, Flookup is good for more than just fuzzy matching; it is the improved replacement for VLOOKUP and INDEX/MATCH that you have been looking for.

Iâ€™m a 19 year old college sophomore who is highly considering a career in data science. Iâ€™m just looking for any general advice youâ€™d give to someone interested in the field, and maybe someone can help me answer some questions.

- How do you like your job in general? 
- How much schooling did it take you? Iâ€™m in my second year of my BS and I want to know if it would be worth looking into grad school/masterâ€™s etc. Or should I just put that time &amp; energy into finding internships?? 
-Iâ€™m about a year into my undergrad, majoring in Psychology. I definitely want to switch to another major, but data science isnâ€™t available at my university. Any suggestions on what major I should switch to?
-What programs should I learn to better prepare myself? I have some basic coding experience, and know how to use SPSS software, but if I need to know Python/Java in this career Iâ€™d love to get a head start on learning.
-Due to never having taken calculus, I am not extremely confident in my general math skills. I do, however, excel in statistics and find it very enjoyable. Would this be a bad career path for me if Iâ€™m unsure of my calculus skills, or could I overcome this?

I did a 26 week course through Datacamp ([www.datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com) in case anyones wondering - not affiliated at all), and got my first set of problems to solve.  I learned a lot, to the point that I'm paralyzed on where to even start.

The problem being theyre trying to predict the future.  I work at a hospital and I was given a dataset of past surgical data since beginning of 2020 and want to predict future surgical data up to the end of 2020.  Initially I started a time series analysis using Rob Hyndman's books, but the more I googled, I thought maybe it could turn into a regression problem with all the additional variables I was given, where we can pick what a day's volumes would be if we can predict a few other data points.  Finally, as I searched through this sub, some folks mention KNN (which I need to read up on!).

I'm at the point where I feel like there's so many ways to go about solving this - where do I even start?

My question:  How do you determine where to start?  Do you just throw the kitchen sink at it and see which method may be best to solve your solution.

datascience,"Iâ€™m currently a sophomore statistics Major and double minoring in economics and statistics. I had chosen to choose minor in economics because it is one of my favorite subjects, but also has an intersection with statistics, with interesting topics such as econometrics. Now my goal isnâ€™t to get into economics heavily, but thought it would be a good supplement. I chose to minor in computer science, thinking it would give me some sort of added value when applying for data science positions later on. However, throughout this semester and computer science coursework Iâ€™m not enjoying it as much, and feel as though the classes I will be taking arenâ€™t going to be an added benefit if I become a data scientist. I know how to code, and code well enough where I can implement data science/cleaning tools and run statistical simulations in python with numpy/pandas etc. however the things Iâ€™m learning right now, (creating a compiler, low level programming) arenâ€™t things I would need in the future, as opposed to the rigorous statistical + quantitative knowledge Iâ€™m taking from my math classes such as probability, calculus 3, Bayesian statistics, linear algebra etc. Iâ€™m thinking about dropping the minor solely based on the fact that at the end of the day, the courses I would have taken I feel like wouldnâ€™t add as much benefit/credibility if I was applying for data scientist roles. The only real reason Iâ€™ve thought about keeping the cs minor is because I also have a interest in machine learning/deep learning, so if I ever want to go that route Iâ€™ll need a software background.
