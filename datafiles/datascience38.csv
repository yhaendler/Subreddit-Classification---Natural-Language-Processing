datascience,"When I use a random sample of my dataset, about 10-15% of its size, T-SNE algorithm repeatedly produces visualisations having a shape of a mesh. This behaviour vanishes when I use a bigger sample or whole dataset.

Example figure: [https://i.imgur.com/9a1Eazy.png](https://i.imgur.com/9a1Eazy.png)

The items in my set are represented by an n-dimensional vector, which is a product of a concatenation of two vectors from two different spaces. My guess is that a variation of items from one of the spaces is significantly higher than a variation of items from the other space. I mean that the later one (low) describes items from a more generalised standpoint. Therefore, the apparent clusters are inferred from the low-variational space and the items inside clusters might be organised based on the higher-variational space. I do not know how to verify this hypothesis, though.

Okay so hear me out, 2 years ago I stepped into the realms of Data. Now it was an exponential growth from what I was exposing myself towards the field during my college years, and as the adage goes when the going gets tough, well the tough gets going. However I was no tough back then (now? debatable) and I would just get easily lost in the realm of data science studies and kept bookmarking left right anything that I got my hands on to get back ""later""

So what? 

You see I am not a person of structure and for me to review whatever I had collected in a day was like searching for a key in a football ground (real incident, no kidding). I had to solve the problem to build something out that gives me some sense of direction and voila!

datascience,I do not understand. How are there so many self taught folks and how are you all landing jobs? I’m not against it but I do not see how it is possible. Every single job I encounter requires a minimum of a masters in a technical field. How are you folks bypassing this?,How are there so many self taught data scientists on this sub when every data science job near me requires a masters or higher?,1593753856
datascience,"Hi Everyone,

I apologize if this is a routine question, but I find so many conflicting views and thought to share my personal rationale for why I decided to take a DS Masters Program (decent enough school, top 20 public college in US). 

I am currently working in a profession known as ""Advanced Manufacturing"". I actually graduated with a BA, and then went back for engineering technologies, and then transitioned into industrial automation (Robotics, controls, system integration etc.). I don't design robots, but I do all the integration, programming, system design, and technical management around it.

So I'm already pretty stretched out skill wise, but honestly, although I had a couple of ""stop"" &amp; ""starts"" in my life, (going from a liberal arts to engineering was tough....), I really feel it makes me much more well rounded in my day to day. I know how to communicate well, and have the technical chops to back it up.

So, manufacturing is kind of undergoing a renaissance, and data's a big thing. Well, it's always been big, but automation and data are becoming major trends. Previously when I had discussions about AI and Machine learning / analytics on factories, and while I understood the concepts at a high level.....I really felt like I was missing a lot of the fundamentals.

So, I decided to enroll in a MS Data Science program has been **GREAT** so far. I'm learning a ton (Stats, R, Python), statistics makes a ton more sense, and I feel like data isn't so esoteric anymore....I get it, it's not magic, and frankly, there are tons of tools out there to do the ""heavy lifting"". I'm not going to develop the next great model, but I want to be a functional guy to get an organization to succeed using data.

Where I would hope to be after getting some experience and graduating, is to be a broad engineering technologist. The type of guy that can help big organizations piece together end to end puzzles (particularly in manufacturing and industry). I understand automation quite well, robotics, controls etc. and machine vision for example, is growing rapidly for quality/inspection use cases, thanks to analytics software....so i kind of see myself being at this intersection of a lot of innovation, but being functional at them at the same time.

I've never really spoken to anyone about this, because the dream seems so far out there, but my gut told me to go back to school after a BA because I really wanted to know how a computer worked inside out....and that led me to automation....which has been an incredibly rewarding decision....I hope the expectations from my DS program, and credibility from these types of program, won't let me down. 

Any perspective? Does this make sense? Fellow data scientists, do you see value in someone with a broad background? I can program, build stuff (physically and design wise), write technical documents and present, and I think I'm getting the hang of statistics and theory as well. I have 1.5 years left in my DS program, and I'm currently pursuing 2 manufacturing DS projects currently (one to model planning at our facilities, and the other for labor optimization)....I understand I also will learn best when I actually do a real project too....

My only fear is that I'll only be useful for my niche industry, and may be an oddball to outsiders? Could that be an issue with optics as well?",On the right path? (MS Data Science Thoughts),1593753374

datascience,"How important is it for data scientists to have clean, modular, reusable code? Here’s my problem: while working on a project, I’ll start off in Jupyter notebooks, toying around with the data, doing some EDA, etc. Eventually I’ll pull out some of that code into functions in a Python file, and call those functions from the Jupyter. Neat.

The problem is, as I get more and more functions, I want to organize them more, make them more generalizable and consistent, etc. I’ll also get carried away with organizing files and source control, cleaning up my notes, and making documentation to explain what models/data/source files/results exist, what they mean, etc.

And then I realize I’ve been spending less and less time getting results, and more on this “overhead”. I struggle to balance the desire the rush ahead and get results with the compulsion to make the code “beautiful” and to have the project in the cleanest possible state. I’ve seen plenty of other projects with terrible organization, no documentation, and confusing, poorly formatted code. But if I’m not producing value, my neatness doesn’t matter.

All in all, I’m feeling pretty unproductive because of these habits. Any advice?","Too much code cleaning, not enough results",1593745792

datascience,"Hey there!

I was wondering how perform the following quickly and with tolerance for out-of-memory spill-over:

|Ticker (lvl 0 idx)|Date (lvl 1 idx)|Data =&gt;|Data\_Filled|Data\_Age|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|IBM|1|10000|10000|0|
||2||10000|1|
||3||10000|2|
|MIB|1|1|1|0|
||2||1|1|
||3|10|10|0|
||4||10|1|

In Pandas, I could do the following, but it was not fast enough:

* GroupBy date
   * Use apply and a custom function to calculate Date\_Age
* GroupBy date
   * Use ffill() to calculate filled data
* Combine the results with a join and name the columns",Performant Group Forward Filled and Data Age Calculation,1593739801
datascience,"I'm not as knowledgeable as many of you; my issue is I don't have the appropriate vocabulary to even figure out what to google to find my answers. So that said, here is my problem thank you in advance.

My company handles customer machines, and I handle the data. Each machine has a Model they start off simple, 16D, 16C, 17D and so on. But then customers get add ons, and so while the machine is still a 16D the sales rep or customer will call it a 16D HD, for Heavy Duty.

And then it gets more complex from there. ie: 1234T, 1234R, D6, D6T, D6-20

In the data there ""Model"" column is just whatever people type in. There it would be ideal to have a ""ParentModel"" (D6) ""ChildModel"" (D6D) ""Model"" (D6D-20) columns but I don't. I started by converting all the numbers and letters into placeholders to get patterns but that didn't work out really.

So my desire is to extract from this garbage pile these common denominators into the parent group and child group. I think all i will need is two tiers.

datascience,"Ok, here is my situation (leaving out uninteresting things).

Dataframe from a csv file, weher I get infos about the infentory of stores, like

Date,StoreID,…,InventoryCount

The rows are sorted by Date, but not store ID, and the amount of stores can very in this time series.

What want. 

I want to see the change in InventoryCount from one day to the previous one, for that I was trying:

`for name, group in df.groupby([StoreID]):`

  `for i in range(1, len(group)):`

`group.loc[i, 'InventoryChange'] = group.loc[i, 'InventoryCount'] - group.loc[i-1, 'InventoryCount']`

I want to Add this collum to the main df. But it errors out with “keyError 1”

datascience,"Lets say I work with consumer electronics. People use them, they break in X days, they return them for a refund. We can measure qualities of the device which get sent to our database, for example average temperature every 24 hours.

My goal would be to add quantitative insights around typical avg temperature for a returned device versus the background (not returned) population. The idea is that a returned device ""is hotter"" than a non-returned device. 

So, I'm taking a bunch of random devices unrelated to one another, along with a piece of information in time, and comparing that against a larger pool of random variables to make a conclusion. 

Is there a name for this kind of analysis? I'm trying to dive deeper into DS, but the domain of problem types is so large I'm having problems focusing in on a niche.",What category is my data science problem?,1593711948

I just graduated with BSBA in Data Analytics in May and have been having the absolute worst time getting any leads in this profession.

datascience,"I know it's common practice to apply satandardization to the data before running a clustering algorithm due to the distances that those algorithms need to calculate across dimensions.

However I have a set of data that looks like this, all but one columns are categorical (0,1 columns), and the remaining column is a float. Does it make sense only to standarize this column and keep the remaining as 0,1s? Since the remaings columns are all 0,1 the distances inbetween these dimensions wouldn't be distorted right?

Furthermore of 175 dimensions, 80 or so are 0 in three of the subsets I need to clusterize. What would be the implications of removing these 80 features, and clusterizing only with non all zero columns? At the end I would add to the clusters 0 values to the missing columns in order to be able to compare these clusters in the main dataset.

Before anyone asks what I need to do is, to clusterize 3 subsets to indeintify the ""main"" clients in each subset and then look for these ""main"" clients in the whole database to rank similar clients to these identified clients.",Standardization and Zero value columns in clustering algorithms,1593710296
