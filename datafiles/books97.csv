books,"Hello,   


I am looking for a specific edition of Stephen Hawking's  **A Brief History Of Time.** It's the one with the grey cover but in hardcover. I know it used to be available on amazon and bookdepository, but they have been unavailable for years. Does anyone know where I can find one even if it's a used copy (well kept preferably) and that ships to Europe!   


I know some more specific information like:  

* **ISBN10** 0553175211
* **ISBN13** 9780553175219

and

books," I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I'm always interested in works dealing with interesting philosophical/religious/psychological concepts. There are some themes/concepts which are relatively easy to pick up or understand. But then there are works, which are very subtle with the themes they are exploring. And often I need some analysis posts to understand the complexity of these works.

So how do I read books, watch anime, movies etc, in a way where I can understand the hidden/deeper meaning beneath the story. For me, the plot and atmosphere matter the most, but I believe there are certain works l would appreciate more or be more suited to write a comprehensive review of, if I would at least understand or come up with an interpretation of them, without the help of additional sources.

I guess having knowledge of philosophy and psychology might be useful, but are there any other tips?

Also since I also want to incorporate certain concepts in my own work, this knowledge would help me weaving my own themes into my story.","How do I analyze fiction, so I can interpret it or find a deeper meaning/understand its themes.",1619738336
books,"I’ve written a good bit on Reddit but this is by far the most uneasy I’ve felt about a post. I started to create another account but decided that if anything, being able to see my profile and history of activity could help show that this is genuine and not just some one and done account.

So I’m going into a 60-day program, state funded and free (which is amazing), and I’ve a pack list of what I can and can’t bring. All the hygenics, 7 days of clothes, etc. I’ve got. But the line that hits me is the last.

The last line of things to bring are comfort items. “Photos, books, letters”.

I don’t really have any photos or letters, the few I have just make me sad so I figure they’re best left home. But as audible books have been my escape for so long, I feel like books are one thing that could mean a lot. 

I know we’ll have counseling throughout each weekday (not sure about weekends), and a gym to work out in once a day, but due to covid they’ve suspended any visitation from family, any leaving the site, so for 60 days it’s just me and the 13 other people in there with me. I plan and hope to make friends, but even with friends there’s only so much time you can spend before you just want to read a book and escape to another world for a while.

I thought about the library but that’s a no go as there’s no way to return them, or even extend the rental from inside as internet and such is non-grata.

So I was wondering if someone had any advice? I imagine there has to be people with books they wouldn’t care to get rid of, I know when I read Game of Thrones I kept forgetting to bring it to work and I’d just buy another copy cause I couldn’t wait my whole shift to read the next chapter. I must’ve ended up with 2-3 copies of each book and probably four copies of the first one. That was years ago though when I was still working as a paramedic and could afford to buy a book just to avoid having to go all day without reading.

Oh how times have changed.

Any advice, recommendations, or thoughts would be truly appreciated. I’ll be honest, I’m absolutely terrified at the idea of doing this but frankly I’m out of options and this is my last hope of getting things together.

Also, if anyone’s spent time in a similar setting I’d love to hear any advice or thoughts you have.","Going into a rehab program and can only bring books, all my “books” are on audible and I can’t bring anything “smart” to listen on.

books,"Just wanted to share something I just encountered for those who use scribd and ever decide to cancel the service. A month or so ago I decided to cancel my membership to Scribd, and went through their account cancellation process. In doing so, I thought I had cancelled my membership, but imagine my surprise when I still saw a charge on my card. 

Turns out that I didn't, in fact, cancel the membership, even though I thought I did. Part of the scribd membership cancellation is a feedback form, which asks for feedback about why you're cancelling. After you submit this form you are taken to a screen thanking you for your feedback, which to me gave me the impression that the cancellation was done. Especially seeing as there was no button to confirm subscription, just a big fat button to contact support. What I didn't realise was that at the bottom of the screen thanking me for feedback, there was a line of text asking me if I was still sure I wanted to cancel, with a text link to complete cancellation. I didn't take a screenshot, unfortunately, but it isn't too far off from the image in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/atf5sd/scribd_i_thought_i_unsubscribed_from_the_free/) post, where everything but the cancel link is prominent. 

So yea, for anyone that goes to cancel their scribd just be aware.

**TL;DR:** If you are going to cancel your scribd membership, be aware that the cancellation process is designed in a way that may trick you into believing you've cancelled due to an arguably deceptive design.",PSA: Scribd Cancellation Quirk,1619737951

books,"Just finished *The Factory* by Hiroko Oyamada and would like to share my thoughts and hopefully hear back from others who have read this quirky little Japanese novella.

I thought it was well-written, with a nice attention to detail, and quite funny. Actually, the humor was my favorite aspect. 

Alternating between three POVs was interesting, especially for such a short book. Deliberately confusing, particularly with the Kafka-style wall-of-text formatting. However I'm not sure I enjoyed reading it in this formatting, I thought it was slightly at odds with the light, somewhat flat tone of the narration. The three narrators tone was very similar—again, a deliberate choice I have to assume.

I enjoyed how elements of the different stories overlapped, which was done cleverly and adeptly, especially with the child's report/study of the factory animals, but I was expecting that aspect to go much further than it did. The allegory with the factory animals was interesting, but I thought the last few lines of the book were over-the-top... didn't need to be underlined so strongly.

Altogether, I didn't think it quite hit the bullseye, but it was an interesting and unique story. What did other people think? Should I read her next one, The Hole?",The Factory by Hiroko Oyamada,1619734354

Maybe this is a bad thing considering the antisocial behavior of almost all of his characters but I just can relate to this kind of writing so much. The way he is really able to put you into the headspace of characters, like I genuinely felt insane at some points of reading American psycho just because of the rapid stream of consciousness style. And I honestly really like that some of his books , at least the ones I have read so far don’t even have a plot, I love that it’s just a deep dive into the minds of certain types of people. Though I have heard that the next one glamorama had much more of a plot which I’m excited for as well. I think Bret Easton Ellis is my favorite author now.

books,"If there is another reason I really hate how they chose live action for Percy Jackson is because of Viria, the girl whose fan art of the franchise become so beloved that Rick Riordan and his publishers hired her to become the official artist for the books. She brought in new life to the franchise by giving the characters a look so fresh and fun that it can even charm both fans and outsiders to the franchise and it's more lively than any live-action actor would ever do. So, the fact she was ignored and not even consulted by Rick or the producers to have them use her character designs for an animated show makes me feel really bad for her as her work was only relegated to marketing and nothing else. Granted, she may have took the news like a champ and was okay with it but I feel it was a waste of her talents to only resort her designs just to market the books instead of giving PJO new life, only for profit and not for love is what I see.

books,"do you think the high school literature curriculum is outdated and needs to be changed? since i live in the US i can only speak from experience with our curriculum, and i think many high schools across the country have a similar reading list for high schoolers (to kill a mockingbird, the great gatsby, etc.) now i know these books are considered classics, but i think it’s important to recognize the problematic themes in these books that i wasn’t able to analyze at a younger age. for example, i loved reading to kill a mockingbird when i was a freshman, but i’ve listened to some discourse recently about how it promotes the white savior complex, and now i see the book in a new light and don’t really think it’s the best book to provide high school students to teach them about racism. wouldn’t it be much more effective to have them read a book by contemporary authors who are POC whose stories are more relatable to our social and political climate today?

books,"This was an utterly uncanny novel. Perhaps I will discover a deeper meaning in it when i am older and therefore wiser. It explores many themes such as desire, fate and (my personal favourite) music. Surely, it is not the best I have read by Murakami because it simply drags on towards the end, however, as I said, i'm just fourteen-year-old.  


Both characters from which perspective the story was told are portrayed as very likeable but i would've immensely appreciated it if Murakami had cut down on the incest. Arguably, the entire novel is centred around it so I'm sure it was a 'the more the merrier' kind of situation for Murakami.  


I understand the concept of it being widely described as a metaphysical novel. It evokes in great detail the nature of consciousness and the relationship between thoughts and actions through Kafka's alter ego: the boy named Crow. I would say that it is literary realism at its best.  


Fate plays a pivotal role in this novel - it is almost as significant as it is in Shakespeare's plays. Notably, there is a thought-provoking simile conjured up towards the beginning of the novel, 'fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing direction. You change direction, but the sandstorm chases you.' That being said, i also adore the use of metaphors in this novel. Murakami's writing strikes me as a more refined version of John Green's, especially due to the reoccurring labyrinth-related metaphors.",thoughts on kafka on the shore by haruki murakami,1619728361

books,"I'm currently over halfway through the third book in the Mistborn trilogy. I've loved the series so far and, although I don't think the writing is great, the story, world and magic systems are. I'm just wondering what the general opinion is on the repetition  I've noticed in these and other books that are part of a trilogy or series?

For example, a character has abilities that are specific to one of three branches of 'magic'. This is explained in some detail in book one and since then is regularly repeated. I'm halfway through book three and a whole page is explaining what's already been explained multiple times before. Why do writers do this?

I understand little reminders early on in each book because the reader might have had a break in between each entry in the series / have waited 10+ years for the next installment. But to repeat the same thing a number of times in the book just makes me roll my eyes and skip a page. 

Is this just bad writing? Do the authors not expect their readers to keep up? Is it some weird thing editors/publishers want their writers to do? I can't figure it out.",Repetition in a Book Series,1619715229

books,"I vividly recall trudging through this novel on a hot summer afternoon, unaware of the beautiful figurative language and nuances in Plath's writing, foraging for the 'plot.'After doing a great deal of research on the poetry and life of Sylvia Plath, I have grown to worship her.  


It is stunning how Plath manipulates similes - for instance 'a summer calm laid its soothing hand over everything, like death' - as they are reminiscent of her tendency to turn the somewhat positive into haunting imagery, almost as though her personal discontentment hangs as a shadow over her writing.  


'I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.'  


The fig tree comparison is yet another example where this 'shadow' can be seen, one of my favourite pieces of writing ever; it coincides so deeply with Esther's ambiguity and the enigma: what is she going to do with her life?",thoughts on the bell jar by sylvia plath,1619715078
books,"Ok so my wife wants to watch Lord of the Rings (neither of us has seen it) but I have a pretty strict rule that I must read the books first, which amazingly I’ve never read. I’m about 1/4th through the first book and I love it. 

My question is, are the storylines of the movies pretty true to the book? For example, if I watch Fellowship after reading the book, will it spoil my reading of the second book? Should I read all three before watching any of the movies?

I love books, print, eBook and audiobooks. I always have. I remember listening to The X Files Eugene Tooms episodes at 2am as a teenager on cassette (gasp!) and being freaked out. I find sometimes a book in print is ok, but the audiobook is phenomenal and vice versa. 

I cohost a book discussion podcast called Fictional Hangover and found that in order to read a book a week for the episode AND for my own pleasure I needed to listen to more as audiobooks. 

As I’ve gotten involved in book groups and discussions I realised there was a stigma or perception of audiobooks. Everyone is allowed their option, but I wanted to find out why. When it came time to pick my research topic I struggled. Like, long painful, lying awake at night struggle until I talked to one of the senior lecturers. Within 2 minutes she had me talking about reading habits and audiobooks and I knew I had my topic.

So while I really appreciate your help with my research survey, I think it would be great to hear on this thread your thoughts on reading habits and print v eBook v audiobooks.

books,"Have you ever been in a Reader's Block?
That is, when you have this strong desire to continue reading the book you've been reading; BUT, for some reason you are not able to squeeze in time to read the book. Or, when you do get the time to read, and you finally take the book in your hands, it feels as if you're injected with serotonin; but the feeling is so utterly profound that you don't find the required concentration and end up not even reading a single page. Well, I don't even know if such a feeling is common or naming it a ""Reader's Block"" is a just thing.

Even so, that overwhelming feeling is there. In fact, here I am typing this post, where I could be reading The Stand or The Shining right now. But it just doesn't seem to be happening. I so desperately want to read them.

books,"*Lolita* is one of my favorite novels, mostly for the writing itself. Recently, I listened to the audiobook version, read by Jeremy Irons, which is fantastic. He gives a brilliant performance. Anyway, it got me thinking about another novel I read a while back, Iris Murdoch’s *The Sea, The Sea*. I had an audible credit I needed to use, so I decided to listen to that one as well.

It occurs to me now how similar these books are, as far as the narrators go. Both are obsessive and narcissistic, fixated on some original *lost love* from the past, prone to lyrical flights of fancy and overwrought descriptions, manipulative and self-deluding, viewing other people mostly as objects in their dream. They rarely consider the feelings of others (although they think they do), and only care about them to the extent that they can play a role in the fantasy. Otherwise they’re expendable or merely a nuisance. Obviously, in the case of *Lolita*, Humbert Humbert being a pedophile adds a whole extra disturbing layer to it. 

Thing is, I understand why someone wouldn’t want to be trapped for 300+ pages with a narrator like this (pedophilia in *Lolita* aside), but when it’s done well I find it super entertaining. Maybe it’s because there is a pretentious/overly romantic side to my own personality, and so I find totally unhealthy depictions of it to be darkly funny in a way, although I can’t relate to the more destructive elements. For example, the way Charles Arrowby forces himself into people’s lives, creating chaos and drama, his casual cruelty and sense of entitlement, his constant push/pull dance with people he senses he has emotional power over.

I do enjoy his fussy descriptions of meals (“Fresh apricots are best of course, but the dried kind, soaked for twenty-four hours and then well drained, make a heavenly accompaniment for any sort of mildly sweet biscuit or cake.”). He’s insufferable but it genuinely makes me laugh out loud at times. 

I’m trying to think of other novels with this kind of narrator. I might put Ignatious from *A Confederency of Dunces* in a similar category, but he doesn’t quite have that melancholic “starring as Hamlet in the tragic play of my life” thing.","Nabokov’s “Lolita,” Iris Murdoch’s “The Sea, The Sea,” and other novels with obsessive, self-absorbed, pretentious and/or overly romanticizing narrators (mild spoilers)",1619711651

books,"The Rhythm Section is a 1999 spy thriller in series written by British author Mark Burnell. The main character is Stephanie Fitzpatrick, basically, the plot is that a bomb brings a plane down and the majority of her family is killed. It’s similar to the movie but that was horrible. Anyway, you don’t actually get into the plot until a hundred pages later, the first 100 pages are her being a prostitute because of her depression, and a journalist that follows her. After that, the plot gains speed and shes contracted as an assassin to get her family back.   


That’s the beginning part, for me the story is pretty good, lots of character development and plot twists, but the best part, the best part, the \*\*writing\*\*, it’s so \*goddamn good\*. The author‘s description of the environment and objects are so amazing that it’s unlike anything I’ve ever read. Take this paragraph for example

\*’An hour later, Proctor hurried along Shaftesbury Avenue. The falling drizzle was so fine it hung in the air like mist but its wetness penetrated everything. Those who were heading across Cambridge Circus toward the Palace Theater for the evening’s performance of *Les Miserables* looked suitably miserable, shoulders curved and heads bowed against the damp chill. The traffic on the Charing Cross Road was solid. Red tail lights shivered in puddles.’\*

It’s like this for every scene and object, and the subsequent books. Take another one

\*’The doors parted to reveal a carpeted hall with cream wallpaper. On the walls, there were prints of engravings depicting idyllic rural scenes. The man showed her into a room. There was a single bed by one wall, a TV, a desk, two armchairs, a full bookcase and a door leading through to a small bathroom.‘\* 

i read some reviews on some other sites and some people didn’t like the long, drawn out explanations and details in the book, but to each their own. 

Now, the character development, over the course of the book, Stephanie develops from a miserable wreck into a cold and trained assassin. The most major turning point is when she goes to a place to train, the author really emphasis her consciousness and the technological aspects of 1999.
