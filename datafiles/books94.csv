In a way, I think all good books should some aspect of this thought-provoking ability, but some are certainly better than others.

Leonardo da Vinci by Walter Isaacson was one example of those books for me. I think Isaacson does a great job of presenting many deep yet approachable ideas throughout the book. I thought it was so interesting the way Leonardo thought through things and made connections between all his different areas he studied, that I was stopping throughout to think about this idea.

Now that I'm finished, I understand what the author is aiming for. And yet there's so much turbulent emotion being expressed that I still somewhat think we're being distracted so that the unbelievable world through which we're reading won't seem too abnormal. 

Again, as a male, I'm irritated that practically every boy and man in the book is characterized as either a victim or more often a guilty aggressor if not both.

books,"I recently started reading Gone with the Wind, which is over 1000 pages long, as most would know. This is probably the longest book I've ever had a chance of successfully completing, since I usually find books of such length intimidating and don't bother, or I do try but give up fairly early. 

I don't like the characters, I don't agree with their values, and I find it a very controversial read on the whole, but the storytelling is brilliant and I just *need* to know how things unfold. *However,* a little over 50% in (approximately on page 650 out of 1200), I accidentally spoiled the ending for myself and now I'm practically in tears. I don't like sad endings, and as much as I dislike the characters, I can't bear for anyone to be hurt. I spoiled it for myself yesterday, and I initially debated genuinely just putting it down, but like I said, getting this far in a book of this length is a huge achievement for me, and genuinely caring about the outcome doesn't make it any easier. 

So I decided instead to write my own final chapter (I haven't written it yet because I'm still around page 700, but I know what I'll put down). Usually, I would just drop the book if something like this happened, which it often does. As someone who finds such situations stressful and emotionally taxing, I'd love to know how everybody else copes with the disappointment?","What do you do when you're enjoying a book, but find out before finishing it that the end is not what you want it to be?

So two heads up before we start this. Firstly, English isn't my first language, so I'm gonna make a lot of grammar mistakes, which seems ironic since I'm doing a book review, but so is life. Secondly, this is a spoiler-heavy review. If you're interested to read the ramblings of someone dipping their toes into literature at 22, or if you already read this book and want to know what I think of it, read on. But if you plan on reading it, then this is your warning

I'm not sure if a trigger warning is due or not, but there'll be a lot of death talking, and family member losing

Now, without further ado. They Both Die At The End 

Okay so I loved this book. Yeah, it's young adult, and yeah I'm too old for that, but I've always read young adult fiction as a kid, so I just have a sweet spot for the genre. I really can't say how much I loved this book. I just finished it earlier today, and I'm not ashamed to say that I teared up a little... Okay maybe not a little 

As a thanatophobe, what drew me to this book was the title. I'm always looking to try to defy my fear, and trying to face it. Or at least read someone else's thoughts who share the same fear, or see how they would deal with it. So a book about two kids dying at 17 and 18, and trying to make due with it and live all the life they've missed in one single day was just the book for me

Rufus and Mateo are Deckers. What's a decker? It's someone who got the death-cast alert. What's the death-cast alert? It's a new service where company employees call people to inform them that they only have one day to live. They don't give exact time or cause, but they do have 100% accuracy and no one has ever been able to beat the alert

So in this world, society has restructured itself around that idea. There are decker discounts, and services dedicated to give deckers the chance to live by skydiving or swimming with sharks (all in vr), and ai just love how real it was. I mean, come on. We all know society isn't all roses and bubblegum. Capitalism will win, and the depressed employee forced to smile and say ""we're sorry to lose you"" or ""our condolences"" to a thousand and one decker every single day was all to real

Apps were made to bring people together. Whether last friend, which was designed to give people one last friend to spend their end day with (which was used by a serial killer to lure deckers out and kill them during one fateful summer), or necro, which is exactly what it sounds like. Hookup app for deckers

All of it is way too real, and you could see it happen in real life if death cast was a thing. People would try to take advantage of it, and as long as you don't get the alert yourself, you'll try to capitalize on other deckers and try to make a profit out of them, whether by making vr services to give them a safe adventure, or messaging someone on last friend and asking if they have a couch to spare

The world is full of A-holes, and this book didn't sugar coat it

But amid all this chaos, humanity still shone. The waiter at althea  was the most devastated stranger to meet our boys, and while everyone else treated them as some statistic (a death cast employee even considering them not humans), the waiter really just tried to give them the best meal of their lives, and was genuinely sorry. Humanity also shone in Rufus and Mateo meeting. They somehow, someway found each other on last friend, and even though their character types is totally cliche (shy nerdy kid with glasses who spends all his days in his safe haven at home vs a hot muscular hunk with a tragic past who lives in a foster home), I loved their dynamics. I mean, just giving you their descriptions alone, should've made it clear what role each of them will play in the other's story, but seeing it unfold was such a pleasant read

It was all so wonderfully done, and I could feel the anxiety, dread, and hope that they might be the exception to death cast's 100% accuracy. But alas, there's no escaping death

Mateo's death happened before Rufus, and it hit me like a brick wall. It was so sudden, and it happened in the safety of his own home as well. The place he thought he could be safe from the outside world, a world that wanted to kill him, while in fact, it was his own house that did it. His last thoughts were about how even when death is to be expected, it's always so sudden, and I couldn't help but choke back tears as I read that part

Rufus's death was also sudden (if he even did die), but it didn't hit me as hard as Mateo. I guess it was expected that it would happen soon since the day was ending, and it he didn't have enough time. Plus what hits me more than the death is the reactions to the death, and Rufus didn't have that. There was no aftermath since the book ended with his supposed death

But still, the book wasn't just about their deaths, but their lives as well, and I loved their budding romance (oh, did I mention they were both bi?). I didn't know whether I wanted them to get romantically attached, or keep it strictly platonic since I believe there are way more books that discuss romantic relationships than platonic friendships, but when they kissed, I didn't mind it at all. Their last moments together, Mateo singing for Rufus, Rufus wearing Mateo's glasses, it was all so intimate and sweet, and I was happy they got to experience these moments together

I also loved how everything is related. The butterfly effect was very prominent in this book, and I loved how connected it all was. There was a loooot of POVs. Almost every character had a pov, and you could see a little snippet of everyone's lives, from the depressed ""we're sorry to loss you"" employee, to the heartless death-cast heralds. You got to see a frame from everyone's life theater

One thing I didn't like though, is the hand holding. It felt like the author was holding your hand the whole time, pointing towards smart metaphors. Like when Mateo was sitting is his half-dug grave, and Rufus helped him out of it, Mateo thought that someone could write poetry about Rufus helping him out of his grave. Also when Mateo was wasting time so he doesn't go out of the house after he got the alert, he suddenly remembered he has to clean the entire house and said that ""its not an excuse not to go out of the house"" 

These are just little nitpicks, but I felt like the author didn't trust his readers to pick up on these stuff themselves. I'm the kind of person who reads and runs. I don't analyze every phrase of every book, I don't look for hidden meanings, but I know if I found a metaphor, I'd like the satisfaction of finding it myself, and not have the author point it out to me 

Okay so, now it's time for me to become controversial. I'm not trying to stir anything up, but just sharing my views

So this is my first time reading ""LGBT literature"" and I have to ask, why the sub genre? I didn't even know it existed before I picked this book up, and the genre is just a weird one. I mean, you could have LGBT characters and not call it ""LGBT literature"" just like you didn't call it ""introvert literature"" because of Mateo or ""extrovert literature"" because of Rufus. It's just weird

Okay so I realized I have some more controversial opinions that probably shouldn't be mentioned here if I wanted to survive to post another day (and hopefully do another review). I don't know what book I'll start next, or what genre it'll be, but I'm open for suggestions

So what did you think of They Both Die At The End? I, personally loved it, but I want to hear your opinions as well. Also any recommendations that you might have for me would be very much appreciated

Having just finished book three, it wasn't really worth the wait. It feels like the story is being dragged out for the sake of making it long enough for a book.

The climax is over incredibly fast and it's doesn't feel like it was worth the it. What's more frustrating is several story threads feel irrelevant to the main story.

For example, there's a small family that are safely living on an island in Scotland, listening to what's happening in the world. I can't remember if they're linked to the main plot in the beginning of book 1, but at the end of the story in book 3, nothings happened to them. So why are they kept relevant throughout the story.

Is it different for different genres? How does a book price get set?

books,"Fingersmith by Sarah Waters. In a few words, a lesbian romance between a scammer, Susan, (fingersmith as an old fashioned way to say delinquent) and a sophisticated lady, Maud Lilly, who she goes to work for, set in the 1860's London. Plot: &gt;!Susan, with the help of ""Gentleman"" plans to scam Maud Lilly, a na√Øve woman who is in love with Gentleman, to get her large fortune.!&lt;

Now, ¬øWhy is it genius? First of all, Sarah pretends to be a heterosexual man who would belong in [r/menwritingwomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/menwritingwomen/) by her description of Maud Lilly during the first part (not a spoiler, it's on the back of the book in the plot description). Here are some direct quotes from Susan's perspective:

&gt;She was like a twig on a rushing river. She was like milk‚Äîtoo pale, too pure, too simple. She was made to be spoiled.  
&gt;  
&gt;For if I was young, then she was an infant, she was a chicken, she was a pigeon that knew nothing.

A perfect damsel! She was in distress 12 hours of the day, blindly in love with Gentleman, and perfectly innocent. &gt;!At one point, she even asks Susan, ""what is it a wife must do, on her wedding night?"" Then they have sex, but Sue, of course, is on top.!&lt;Everyone sees her this way, especially Susan during the first part. And I'm not going to lie, she fits into some of the adjectives. However, all the plot twists and revelations make for a delicious thrill while reading. *Oh, you thought you, inferior reader, were up to date on the drama? \*Slams down plot twist card on the table\*.* It leaves you gasping and closing the book in shock every now and then.

Then there's the fact that Ms. Waters explains the different points of view of the characters. You can really tell that one person interprets a scene differently than the other, so it feels real.

Something I noticed and loved was the use of &gt;!the ""pearl"" adjective from Susan to Maud. When they first have sex, Susan says to Maud, ""You pearl, you pearl"". A pearl is cold, it's shiny, it's fragile, it's valuable. This is how Susan basically sees Maud. Her bedroom is cold until Susan puts more fire to it, and Briar is a somber place with rarely any sun. Maud is, for the first part of the book, a shiny new, valuable and fragile human (not objectification at all). However, at the very last page, she says ""not like a pearl, warmer than one"". After going through everything, she understands she's a human, she's smart and she's imperfect, and she loves her either way. Romance 100.!&lt;

I didn't like that it's comparable to all the lesbian drama period movies that are the main content lesbians get nowadays, that all share a similar sequence:

1. Lesbians meet
2. One of them is married/promised/being courted
3. They fall in love
4. They are intimate right after they kiss for the first time (not going to lie, I like this trope)
5. They get separated and mostly have a sad ending

(If you know a lesbian movie or book that doesn't roughly follow this sequence please let me know in the comments!)

It moves a bit slow for some people, mainly the second and third part, but I've learned to love the long scenes in movies and books. For example: Portrait of a lady on fire was boring to me when I first watched it, but rewatching it I discovered and noticed so many little things, so many odd little things, that made the movie much more intricate than what I first expected. *It's all in reading between the lines*.

If I had written it I would have &gt;!made the ending less easy for Susan. She found Maud after looking for like two days. Susan is so decided to look for Maud absolutely everywhere, and maybe never return to London, that it's, in my opinion, lazy to let her find her at the first place she looks. Of course I don't mean make a whole other book describing a Nancy Drew style Susan looking for Maud everywhere in the world, but I would have left the last chapter in Susan saying goodbye to Dainty and leaving, then make a bit of a long epilogue explaining how she looked for her for maybe a few months, then found her at Briar and we get that amazingly heartwarming ending.!&lt;

The ending is (happy/sad/neutral): &gt;!For me, it was a perfectly happy ending.!&lt;",Fingersmith by Sarah Waters is a genius novel (Spoilers are censored),1618414824

books,"I'm 18 years old and recently started to try and read books for fun as a hobby. I remember the last time I read a book for fun was when I was 9 years old. I remember being able to focus/concentrate a lot better and it came a lot faster to me. 

My attention span/focus specifically for books has gone out the window (and I think it's because I haven't read a book in so many years? So almost everyday i've been practicing reading books and trying to focus on the storylines but I find myself only reading the words but not really paying attention to the full context of what the words say. 

I can focus on social media and other things perfectly fine (which I heard hurts your long-attention span for concentration, but not sure if that's true). 

This is making reading not very fun, but i'm not trying give up early if I can make it work. But if I can never teach myself to fully focus on what the book is actually saying then I feel like i'm not going to be able to pursue this hobby. 

Is this normal when you first start reading books after going literally years without doing it? I feel like I almost have to retrain my brain to focus/concentrate again because it's just not there. I've noticed some slight improvements over the past week but nothing major.

books,"Longtime lurker. I read this book called [Bell Hammers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48731251-bell-hammers) \+ won it off a Goodreads giveaway. Humor novel set in the Little Egypt region of Southern Illinois. This book talks about... I felt very TIL-y most of the time. For instance, I¬†didn't know about the Herrin Massacre of Bloody Williamson (HORRIFIC real event in Illinois sponsored by Chicago money) + that the first bomb dropped from an airplane in history was in Southern Illinois during the coal wars (!!!!)

It's this rambling picaresque (which the [Publisher's Weekly review warned me about](https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-949547-02-3)). He wrote it in a heavy dialect from the region. Yet... I settled in + it ended up being hilarious at parts. Many pranks + MIT-level hacks. The book doesn't really seem to go anywhere until the VERY end, but it's very, very powerful at the end.

Here's the thing, though: Remmy, the main character, I ADORED + he reminded me of all the things I loved about the nostalgia and humor of Tom Sawyer. Yet... his journey is as sad as some of the sad stuff in Toni Morrison. It felt like Secondhand Lions + Boy's Life + Marquez. But also like many of the sprawling family sagas I love (Thorn Birds, Pillars of the Earth, Gone with the Wind, TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, Bonfire of the Vanities, Joy Luck Club).
