datascience,"I am graduating with a biology degree this spring and will be working at the National Institutes of Health, doing computational biology research mostly with sequence analysis and clinical data in cancer patients. I was wondering if there’s any statistics books you guys have come across that would be a good overview of practical statistics and as a reference for later.

As a background, my math background is calculus I and II - I have not taken multivariate calculus but am decent at math so I wouldn’t mind learning some aspects if needed. I currently do some computational work with python but all the statistics has been pretty basic. I’ve taken intro stats so I don’t really need an in depth intro to probability/hypothesis tests etc. 

I’ve found that my intro stats classes haven’t really prepared me for some of the statistical methods used in biology and especially in computational biology and sequence analysis, which can get pretty stats heavy at times. What I’m looking for is a book that is more applied, though I don’t mind some theory as a basis. I’d like to be extremely comfortable with and know the ins and outs of scientific statistics as it relates to medical and biological investigations. 

I’d appreciate any textbook or video series recommendations. I don’t have a lot of time to take an online course but if you guys know of one that is self-paced and would suit my needs I can definitely consider it. Thanks in advance.",Best statistics textbook for biomedical scientists?,1613777382
datascience,"Hi all,

Looking for some advice. The hardest part is that I'm still not knowledgeable enough about the Data Sci nor CS fields (and what they do) to solidify what I want to end up doing for the rest of my life.

A little background about me: I started off in EE in undergrad, failed miserably (though mostly due to outside circumstances), and tried CS, but the theory was hard to understand, the school didn't give a f about their students' learning, and I didn't have a ""why"" to push myself to tough out the hard theory, other than ""to get a good job"". My GPA was abysmal. I finally gave up, told myself I was ""too dumb to code"", quit school, worked for a few years, and went back to business school and graduated top of my class. With the high GPA, I landed a cool gig doing finance, which turned into pricing &amp; sales analytics, so I learned SQL and Tableau. I learned a little Python just to make my work more efficient.

I'm okay doing analytics, but it's not my passion, because I don't see it usefully benefitting my life other than to get a high-paying job. However, Data Sci interests me because I can see it being applied to my own life: personal finance, starting a business, helping non-profits (especially for COVID projects), and creating AI to help write music (I'm a musician too).

Now, I'm torn. A lot of people have recommended that I go to grad school for CS instead of Data Sci, because I don't have the CS fundamentals. Others recommended that I  do a CS bootcamp or MOOC and call it a day instead of spending a ton of money. Others recommended that since I'm more experienced in analytics, that I do a MS or bootcamp in Data Sci, because I probably won't get into a good CS school anyway. I'd prefer to start off with more than just MOOCS, because I don't know where to start.. there's a lot out there, and it's overwhelming. I've got a list of schools but open to any and all suggestions!

datascience,"Background: I was a Project Manager (PMP) who got interested in data. I have an Econ degree, and I learned enough econometrics to be able to explain/implement most regression types. I had a load of fun doing what I am writing about below, but my company is slowing down and I am probably getting a lay off. I want to keep doing this, but not sure really where to go from here.

In my company, I moved into a role where I had the opportunity to create the workflows for how they would do their cost analysis (this is small data by definition, but big enough to where it is very painful to do things in Excel). I ended up building the following:

* AWS Amplify Web UI w/ Incognito Authentication. User register, uploads various raw data pulls from internal software (our software is custom built and has no usable APIs).
* AWS Amplify pushes the data into S3
* AWS RDS I setup for being on the final receiving end (MySQL)
* S3 Sends notification to Lambda for data preprocessing
* Part 1 of Lambda code does the pull from S3, data preprocessing, automatically detects which form of data the user is submitting to direct it to appropriate pre-existing tables. This is mostly done with  boto and Pandas.
* Table Schema was built manually and written into a config file in Lambda.
* Part 2 of Lambda code sockets into the AWS MySQL and writes the pre-processed data to the RDS.
* I'll admit here I got a little lazy and decided just to truncate the existing tables each time, but with the volume of data going through I didn't think it would be an issue. In an environment where resource management becomes an issue, I'd probably make a valiant effort to ensure only writes that contained new data key would be performed.
* Power BI Dashboard I built then is permanently socketed into the MySQL on AWS. Multiple tabs, multiple tables.
* Data refresh. Done.

The User Procedure/Experience is as follows (it was intended to be rather hands off):

* User registers to the Web UI. Uploads some common data files (in our case its xlsx).
* User logs into their Office 365, has shared link to the dashboard. Refreshes data in dashboard.
* Good to go.

I can talk about this rather in depth. But I guess what I'm asking is, how much do I need to be able to do to confidently look for work in this domain? What should I start learning next? And considering that I enjoyed this type of work, what would you even call this, and how could I further strengthen that brand for myself?

datascience,"I've been self-learning Data Science, but browsing this subreddit, it would appear the field is a bit overhyped and very oversaturated - with millions of juniors graduating in data science trying to break into the industry.

I currently work full-time in an unrelated role, but I'm at the age now where I just want to land myself a programming job where I can earn decent enough money. I'm worried I'll spend the next couple of years self-learning Data Science, only to spend another 2 years or more trying to get a job.

I should note I have various interests. I do enjoy stats, programming, data, and so on. So I find enjoyment in anything that relates to these - although I'm probably a better programmer than a statistician. I'm okay at Maths, but I do have to relearn everything starting from Algebra, and I'm always doubtful as to whether or not I could ever apply a machine learning algorithm to a business problem. I'm also aware, even with the time I've already spent learning Data Science, it would probably take me a lot less time to start earning money in web development.

I'm just wondering if the right thing for me right now would be to switch to something like web development. I enjoyed learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Or perhaps find a Python developer position. I don't really know. Ideally I would just learn everything and see what happens but obviously that's not an option.

Whatever I choose, the idea of giving up on something I've dedicated 100s of hours to only to start from scratch in another field is causing me all kinds of mental anguish, especially at the age of 29.

datascience," Here's a quick review of PDSHB, a great book to learn Python for data related tasks.

# Synopsis

Provides details and code example on how to use the Python data science stack to work with data.

The book covers:

* IPython and Jupyter
* NumPy
* Data Manipulation with Pandas
* Data Visualization with Matplotlib
* Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

# Who is the Book For

It's for people who:

* Want to learn Python's stack for data science tasks
* Want to learn to store, manipulate, and gain insight from data
* Have some familiarity with python

People with zero Python experience might want to take a quick beginners course before reading the book.

# What I liked

* Overview of Python's data science stack
* Includes most critical tasks; data manipulation, data visualization, and machine learning
* Consume book on multiple mediums; GitHub, physical books, Jupyter Notebooks, etc.

The author ensures readers get a baseline of knowledge that will be applicable to many problems by including these libraries. These are the most common data science libraries so it’s great to see that the book is dedicated to them.

# What I Disliked

* No practice exercises
* Long and tedious to work through

There are no practice exercises at the end of sections or chapters to help the reader solidify their learning. In my opinion, practice exercises are a critical aspect of a data science book to help the reader internalize the ideas.

The book is long and dense at just over 500 pages. There is so much information packed into PDSHB that it never feels like you get a break while reading. It feels tedious at times, especially if you’re coding along with all the examples.

# What Could Make it Better

* Practice problems
* A shorter or Abridged Version

A benefit of practice problems is that the book would be 100% self-contained. There would be no need for the reader to explore content outside of the book to get practice.

A shorter, abridged version of the book with practice problems may be a perfect balance.

datascience,"**I hope this can be considered on-topic as it is, at the end of the day, a question on data science careers.**

&amp;#x200B;

I am no developer nor data scientist but there is some stuff I do in code (the actual language is irrelevant for my question); some of this stuff used to be done in Excel (it took forever and was incredibly messy) while some other stuff was never done at all because it simply cannot be done with spreadsheets.

&amp;#x200B;

**I sometimes meet a lot of resistance from the people with whom I have to share this work:** many say they prefer Excel because:

1. they can ""see"" the calculations, and
2. they can change some of the inputs / assumptions and see for themselves how the outputs change

&amp;#x200B;

1) is nonsense. We are talking about huge, undocumented spreadsheets with loads of tabs, interconnected calculations etc - auditing and debugging them is a nightmare. I think these people like the *delusion* of thinking they might understand it if they spent enough time on it, but it's a delusion

2) This is trickier. I cannot give IT-illiterate dinosaurs some code for them to play around with, but I can give them a spreadsheet with an idiot-proof sheet in which they can change some inputs themselves.

**Has this ever happened to you? How do you handle it?**

**What I typically do is:**

* Incorporate all the scenarios I can think of and be flexible in adding more. I mean, if I show you what happens when assumption x is 5%,7.5% and 10% lower, do you really need to see what happens when it's 5.2345% lower? I think this is related to a delusion of control, too
* Try to point out the benefits of code vs spreadsheets: version control, a clear audit trail, unit tests etc. This usually gets me nowhere with dinosaurs whose idea of version control is having files named ""spreadsheet\_v23\_FINAL\_v\_5\_REALLY\_FINAL\_VERSION\_v3""
* Point out it takes me less time to produce a more robust output; again, this typically gets me nowhere - many people's approach is: the whole world runs on Excel, what does this weirdo want?

**Of course a lot depends on what kind of people you are getting resistance from:**

* if it is clients / customers / business partners etc, there's only so much you can do. They may be wrong, they may be IT-illiterate dinosaurs, but you can't tell them that, can you? :)
* if it is colleagues, especially more junior ones, it is easier to educate them on the pros and cons
* very senior managers very rarely care, in my experience
* intermediate middle-managers can be trickier, especially if they feel threatened - a strong reason to want that delusion of control",Ever met resistance when using code instead of spreadsheets? How do you handle those who insist on using Excel because that's all they know?,1613735048

Yesterday, I rewatched one of these Udemy courses (btw this course is one of the tops in terms of the ratings and the number of people watching) and I was impressed how sloppy the instructor was in an univariate linear regression problem. He basically just verified if the data is more or less linear and applied a cross-validation analysis with $R\^2=0.8$, He didn't check more carefully the linear assumption with the residuals graph, the independence and constant variation of the residuous neither, etc.

I suppose many of the 6-months-DS-without-stat/math-background make predictions in this way. (In some kaggle challenges most of people just apply a bunch of algorithms blindly (maybe some algorithms may need opposite assumptions) and choose the one that gives them the best prediction(type I/II error or a mixed of the two).

I’ve been moved around teams a few times, the most value-add having been embedded in Product. Because of volatility and several company/project pivots, fifty percent of the DS team have left the company in the last 6 months. We also had/have no data leadership.

Recently we got a VP of Engineering and now the data team reports to him. Product is left without any data scientists. And the data scientists we have are being tasked with database management roles to “revamp” our existing data infrastructure as part of a 3-6 month project. There are certainly gaps to repair, but most of our data is already in usable state.

While DB management is certainly part of the data scientist’s duty, I’m concerned the company is being short-sighted with the data science talent they’ve so far been able to retain.

Decks need to be very straightforward and what I find is often put forth by sales people who need to be able to explain it in a couple sentences or less. So not only do I need to choose simple methods but due to the nature of my work my stats knowledge has... dulled over the years. 

Our thesis is that a primary driver of multifamily rents is jobs (easily shown) and that in port cities e-commerce is helping to fuel a growth in port jobs. On the second piece I'm running into an issue in that the relationship is non-linear. E-commerce has grown steadily since 2000 and when ecommerce sales were lower there were two recessions that caused employment to fluctuate. One of my colleagues noted that it's inappropriate to use either Pearson's R or OLS in this situation. But those are the two things that can be made easily understood.

What I noticed is that when cutting the data off at 2009 the relationship is linear. And the 2009+ relationship is similar to using all of the data and just pretending there's no issue with non-linearity.

Essentially, my question is: what the community is doing when it comes to re-training models in which an intervention based on model predictions influences the target variable.

Take, for example, a model to predict customer churn. Prior to initial training assume there was no intervention to reduce churn. Following implementation of the model, the company implements a new intervention intended to reduce churn for those with medium-to-high likelihood of churning. Let's say the intervention was effective. A year later, due to other factors (like changes in the competitive landscape, customer age, etc.), The model and/or intervention are no longer effective. Those with low predicted probability of churning (and perhaps did not receive the intervention) are now churning with a much higher rate.

Now the company wants to you re-train the model, however your target for the last year has been influenced by the presence of the intervention intended to reduce churn. Naively re-training could result in a poor performing model, increase in FNs, etc.

There are certainly ways to address this: including the intervention as a feature during re-training, Holding out a random sample of individuals to not receive the intervention, ensemble of original &amp; new model. But all have their drawbacks and limitations.

I'm really Interested to hear what others are doing or would do in this situation. Also if there is any robust literature on the topic. I've found some articles but they seem to be scattered and the references haven't led me to a large body of research.

Faker Library

This release introduces the ‘faker’ library in De-Identification Module to automatically generate random data like names, dates, addresses, etc. so users do not have to specify dummy data (custom obfuscation files can still be used). It also improves the obfuscation results due to a bigger pool of random values.

This release introduces 3 new relation extraction models between body parts and clinical entities and 1 new relation extraction model between date and clinical entities. These models are trained using a binary relation extraction approach for better accuracy.

&amp;#x200B;

**NEW RESOLVER MODELS USING JSL SBERT**

\- sbiobertresolve\_icd10cm\_augmented

\- sbiobertresolve\_cpt\_augmented

\- sbiobertresolve\_cpt\_procedures\_augmented

\- sbiobertresolve\_icd10cm\_augmented\_billable\_hcc

\- sbiobertresolve\_hcc\_augmented

Returning auxiliary columns mapped to resolutions: Chunk entity resolver and sentence entity resolver now returns auxiliary data that is mapped the resolutions during training. This will allow users to get multiple resolutions with a single model without using any other annotator in the pipeline (In order to get billable codes otherwise there need to be other modules in the same pipeline)

&amp;#x200B;

We also added a cosine similarity metric in metadata to resolve entities and find the closest matches, resulting in better, more semantically correct results.

I am quite new to the topic so please don't judge me if I'm completely wrong about something. I have made an attempt to fit an ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,Q,D)s, and carry out forecasts. However, I do not understand if this approach is feasible.

I have data containing sales on a daily basis over approx 3 years, the values vary very much from day to day. The data is not stationary (trend is obvious when visualising the data, and assuming there is yearly seasonality). I have aggregated the data on a weekly level. When doing a ADF test on the data, the p-value is &gt; 0.05 and indicating that the data is not stationary.

In order to make data stationary, I take difference on the data until the ADF yields p-value &lt; 0.05, which happens after one difference (so d = 1).   
**Questions: 1. Is this enough in order to say that the data is stationary? 2. Should I look for seasonal difference too; how?**   


Further, for finding parameters p,d: I look at ACF and PACF. These do not exhibit a 'perfect decaying behaviour'.  These have significant values for lag=1 or 2, and they can also show a spike at for example lag=12.  **Questions: 3. Is it still fine for me to proceed on with using ARIMA, or is the weird decaying behavior telling us something else? 4. How do I find suitable starting values of P, D?**  


Further, I have divided the data into test (10%, latest observations) and train (90%) and fitted an auto.arima on the training data with starting params d=1, D=1, and max\_p=3, max\_q=3 and find the best params based on AIC. After fitting this arima model, I carry out forecasts and compare these to the test data. The forecasts are very bad and more seems to **memorize earlier behavior from the same time previous year - not following the latest behavior in the data?**  Any ideas what might be wrongly here?
