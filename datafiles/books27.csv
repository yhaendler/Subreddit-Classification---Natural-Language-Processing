books,"Hello there. 

This post reffers not only to exams, but to slow reading in general, and I'm not entirely sure it fits on this subreddit.

First of all, I want to start by saying I've never read too much in my life, but I have always noted that I don't read fast, and even slow by some standards. I am now in my first year at University, studying Law, and I was never put against such enormous quantities of information and reading in general. My interest in reading actual books grew and am reading more and more, besides my mandatory lectures.

A few days ago I've started going through a course of mine that I haven't touched since before quarantine hit, and I was behind approximatively \~100 pages. I had a goal today to read a 50 pages chapter and underline important stuff. So I started the work, and I am reading 10 pages per hour. Not only this, but after 15 pages or so I felt so exhaused I couldn't go on anymore. I read too slow, and can't figure out what is important and what not, and read it word by word. This way, I'm never going to actually use my time properly, because it took my 5 damn hours to READ, not learn, 50 pages.

I feel so hopeless and lost, because I've got hundreds of pages that I need to learn for every single exam, and I can't do it properly, and it just wastes my time. It might not sound like a big problem, but it is, as it messes up with my really really bad, and my stress grows bigger and bigger.

Hey all,

When I was younger, I had this book ""The Elephant's Airplane and other Machines.""  It was always one of my favorites.  I loved the artwork in it; it was very detailed and beautifully colored.  Since having my own child, I asked my parents to send me our old copy so I could read it to my daughter when she's older.  I've since gone on Amazon and purchased three other books that have the same illustrator, Doris Susan Smith.  I was wondering if anyone has any information on her, since online I could only find a very short entry on Goodreads.  Is she still living?  Where is she from?  Did anyone else have these books?  They seem pretty rare on Amazon (the book Need a House? Call Ms. Mouse! was quite expensive, since I guess it was banned for having imagery of some of the animals smoking, which makes no sense to me since Curious George has plenty of art of the Man in the Yellow Hat smoking a pipe).

books,"Before March, my choice of books was mixed, really. Fantasy, nonfiction, biographical, science-fiction etc. Anything that caught my eye, really. But March 2020 happened, with Covid-19 rapidly spreading across the globe, and suddenly my reading selection turned grimmer. I've since read:-

* The Stand by Stephen King.
* 1984 by George Orwell.
* '48 by James Herbert.
* Boneshaker by Cherie Priest.
* Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.

I've got several more lined up, like Atwood, Stephenson and more books by King.

I guess I'm subconsciously trying to remind myself that things can always be worse. I know, it's a rather bleak comparison to make, considering how bad things are right now. Reading has really kept my mind occupied. 

One of my favorite moments from these books is from The Stand. Nick Andros, a deaf and mute (but intelligent) character, is deputized and is guarding the prisoners, when the people of the town (Shoyo) start dying like flies. One evening, the power goes off, leaving a deaf, mute character in the darkness with prisoners, symbolizing subtly but powerful the advent of the apocalypse. The book set me on edge at every point.

books,"I acknowledge that this story is mentioned and discussed A LOT (*and rightfully so!*) on this subreddit so forgive me for making another post on it. However, looking back through the past discussions I haven't seen much related to the differences between the short story and full length novel. I was crazy and read the short story first and then the novel in the same day and I have to say I think I preferred the short story greatly over the novel, despite the latter offering more depth and background to Charlie's story. Spoilers for the novel ahead:   


&gt;!I found the visit to the Warren home and the science convention (until the release of Algernon) incredibly moving additions to the story that highlighted Charlie's emotional pain with his situation and unknown future, and also found the history of his upbringing and relations with his family interesting too. But for me this was all that the novel added for me. I understand that at his peak of intelligence, he was intentionally portrayed to be smarter and superior to the average human but I really couldn't keep up with a lot of his thoughts to the point where I wasn't connecting to the book at all (is this the point?). I found the abstract passages (eg. final therapy session) to be waffle I couldn't really comprehend and to me, this took away from his regression as I wasn't as engrossed in the novel as I was the short story. As for the love and sexual components in the novel, I was somewhat neutral to these and realise I could probably gain more from these parts from a 2nd reading. If there was a phase of Charlie's journey that I would've liked expansion on from the short story, it would be his regression 'back down the elevator', however the novel didn't add as much to this phase as it did to his childhood and intelligent phase. !&lt;  


From those that have read either or both, what do you think? Do you prefer one over the other? Thanks for reading!

books,"I've been an avid reader since I started reading about a decade ago.With a social life and my full time job, I aim to complete a modest 10-15 books year on year which I've been able to do regularly. Over the years I've come across two/three major limitations of reading books and just wanted to validate if this is something that people across the world face as well:Firstly, there's beautiful literature and intelligent ideas out there that might never reach the masses cause it's written in languages other than English and translation from languages like Hindi/Chinese/Spanish/Japanese etc isn't nearly as high. This Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) keeps me anxious on all the great things we might never have access to.Secondly, just reading a book is a half fulfilled experience in my opinion cause we play along with the narrative the author or poet sets which leads us to making big logic leaps as we move along in the book. Discussing it with people or writing one's interpretations down is probably one way to overcome this issue since we are forced to verbally articulate what we are reading and hence bridge said logic gaps.Thirdly, a reader like me will go through 10 books a year for the next \~40/50 years which amounts to only 500 books in a lifetime. Doesn't this seem strikingly low? Every half decent library and book store has more than twice this amount of books.

Does anyone else resonate with any of these three problems and can help come up with ways of solving them?",Limitations of Reading a Book,1589022194
