datascience,"Hi All!

I was wondering if I could get some advice:

So I am 27 years old. Majored in Business Finance from a top U.S. university. Over the past 3-5 years since graduating (after leaving the finance/i-banking world), I've tried a bunch of different things and have finally come upon data science/ml. I have decided that this is the route that I am going to commit to and pursue for my career. 

Now here's the thing. I've been programming for the past 6 months or so, taking some courses. Built a few small things in the courses. And the plan has been to work another 6 months- 1 year and continue in courses and build a bigger project or two for my portfolio. Then to hopefully land a data science or ml internship. 

But here's the thing. I can't stand not knowing exactly what's going on ""under the hood"". I want to get to the source. AKA...Mathematics. Not only that I want to know (what's going on under the hood), but frankly, it seems that ALL data science jobs have a pre-req of a masters (or more) in a quant field. 

If I were to pursue the route that I'm on now and go straight into the field, I presume it would be more of a data analyst type of role. 

Now here's the thing. I don't see a clear route to move into data science from a data analyst role (I mean, sure, you could take some programming and other classes on the side and build projects on the side to eventually have something to show, but that would take a lot...I'm not sure I would have the energy to have a full time job and then to spend so many hours on top of that taking very difficult classes and building projects). Again, I think it would come down to going back to school and getting that masters. 

I have a family friend who is a professor of statistics at Stanford, and he seems to recommend that I just go straight into the field and start working because he says that it would be like a 5 year journey to lean the maths (which it would because I would have to take a year or two of pre-reqs before I could even apply for my masters in stats!). 

Here's the thing though: I don't mind a 5 year journey into maths. Meanwhile, I could meet really smart people and work on side-projects and apply what I'm learning and TRULY understand what's going on with the whole ML thing. 

Hopefully this rant makes some sense at all.

What do you guys think??? Any input is appreciated. Thanks so much for taking the time to read.",Get in the field asap vs. going back to get my masters (stats),1588179631

datascience,"I work in targeted marketing for a company that is somewhat new to using analytics and data science. This is my first job out of college, so I’m also pretty new to real world data science applications. My current project is to retrain and enhance a model that was built about 2 years before I started here and has not since been touched or tuned. The purpose is to predict propensity to make a purchase, and then immediately supply that person with a targeted offer. However, looking at the incumbent model’s performance, for the past year or so it has been selecting just about everyone it scores. So my question is, when looking back and retraining to predict propensity to purchase, do I need to account for the effect of being serviced this offer or is this something I’m overthinking? The goal is to be able to avoid sending the offer to people with a very high propensity and instead use the model to target people that can hopefully be swayed into making a purchase, but without a control in place I have no accurate way to measure the treatment effect.

datascience,"So I am working on a project in R Studio that is looking at the genome of a bacteria called C. crescentus. Basically, I am looking at expression of every gene in this bacteria, and trying to determine if genes with similar expression statistics (using the fold change, if you wanna know) are more likely to be clustered together in the genome (for those not inclined to genetics, the genome is one long string of genes, i.e. gene1-gene2-gene3), or are they distributed randomly, and one genes expression statistic is not correlated whatsoever with its neighbors. I have run into a couple questions and would love your guy's thoughts.

1. Right now I'm using a Mantel test for comparing two distance matrices, i.e. comparing every single combination of points and looking at their spatial distance in the genome (how many genes come in between) and genetic expression ""distance"" (just a difference in expression statistic). I've also created a scatter plot comparing the spatial distances of pairs of points versus their expression difference, to see if points closer together had a smaller difference in expression. I was just wondering if you guys had any other ideas with how I could look at this problem/any packages good for gene clustering or clustering in general.
2. This expression statistic has a range of anywhere between negative and positive infinity. However, the way this statistic is calculated, NA's are produced in place of any infinities or zeroes. Now, these would-be infinities and zeroes aren't significantly different biologically compared to say, expression statistics that are extremely high or extremely low; they just can't be calculated and thus can't be used when looking for clustering based off of this expression. How can I include them in my analysis? Do I need to look at them seperately and just compare would-be zeroes to other would-be zeroes for clustering, or should I look into subbing in very high or very low values to include them in the overall analysis? Like I said, these genes have no reason biologically to be set apart and studied separately from the rest of the genes, so I hope to not exclude them from the bulk of the analysis, but I don't see many other ways here to look at them.
3. If I were to look at them separately, I would probably just look at their spatial distance compared to each other, since their expression statistic would all be the same. Now is there some test or statistic to measure how clustered these points would be spatially among the other genes with a p-value, the null hypothesis being the genes are randomly distributed? I figured there would be some spatial autocorrelation-like test to test a subset of values in the context of the rest of the values, but I'm not coming up with much luck after googling. Any known tests out there that could help me out? One colleague I talked to suggested I simulate a p-value by coming up with some statistic, like average distance between all 800 genes with NA values, and testing the actual 800 genes and comparing that to a 1000 different trials of randomizing those 800 genes' placements. Whatever the percentage of trials with a higher average distance statistic would be my p-value. How does that sound? It sounds alright to me, but I know it would take a while to code that into R. Also, I'm not sure that average distance between points would be the best statistic to use there to look for clustering, but I'm not sure what a more accurate statistic would look like. Any ideas on other ways I could calculate clustering?

I can study and practise sure but in terms of real experience I don't have much. The only DS jobs I would be able to land would be title inflated business intelligence roles. I might switch to a software engineering role because I didn't build any relavent experience for the type of jobs that I want. And I'm also tired of the reporting heavy work. I want to go somewhere where I can build things and code more than I do, with team that follows strong software eng practises.
 Do you think DS jobs with actually challenging work will be harder to get into since I don't have modelling/ML experience? 

My company is willing to start Green Card process, and then I'll be stuck here for a couple of years. At least my gc will process faster since processing dates for my nationality is current. It also makes staying at my current role more attractive since I don't know if newer companies would be willing to file GC straight away.

datascience,"Hi All,

I am relatively early in my career in data with 3 years of work experience and an education background in stem (engineering/operations research). If it is relevant, I have always work in a business department as the main data person.

With my limited work experience,  I have been really struggling with determining if a simple average/count analysis or more in-depth stat analysis are needed to make data driven decisions. Especially, when in-depth analysis are usually inconclusive. 

How do you know when simple reporting averages are enough to make a decision or a deeper analysis should be done? How do you convince the business that inconclusive results from deeper analysis means you should not make a decision based purely on the current data? 

**For example** (imgur screenshot of the example/methods).

[https://imgur.com/tT0tmB5](https://imgur.com/tT0tmB5)

Lets say I have data on the channels (phone, email) customer support agents use to resolve tickets and the time to complete the tickets. Usually, their is a report that is monitoring the ticket resolution overtime and at some point an executive might ask ""should we invest more resources in the phone or email channel). 

**Data Descriptive Stats Results**

email = 5.2 mins avg with 9.7 variance and 5 samples

phone =  6.2 mins avg with 2.7 variance and 5 samples

**Method 1**

Based on this ask, I noticed that the majority of the time, people would just take the average and say that the email channel closes tickets faster by 1 minute, therefore we should invest our resources in email. (Method 1)

**Method 2**

On the other hand, I would run a hypothesis test and noticed that the results are inconclusive, because the variance is high, small sample, and the averages are not that different to determine a difference. Therefore, I would recommend to collect more data for a future experiment to determine a decision.

However, i noticed that in working with the business, their is a very heavy bias to using method 1, because method 2 was inconclusive, the analysis was too complicated, or the business wants to execute towards something immediately.

So far, the best thing I have found is **Freie Universität Berlin**'s course on [Statistics and Geospatial Data Analysis](https://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/v/soga/index.html) from the department of Earth Sciences. It is very goddamn comprehensive and also covers the statistics basics required to take it in case someone lacks them. I am currently going through it and in my humble opinion it really makes a beast of an introduction. Some bonuses:

* Although the notes have been made to accompany lectures on the matter, they are so well explained that it doesn't really matter, you can use them on their own.
* 100% free.
* FULL of R code snipets and graphs, the lecturer really knows how to implement RMarkdowns as they have to.
* For those already familiar with both R and undergraduate level statistics, I would go directly to the geospatial part, as the rest is related to the basics of the language and the field, respectively.

Overall, I think it is very cool and I intend using it to kickstart my learning in the field. Not to say there are not other good resources around ([this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/6phr4t/workflow_examples_for_spatial_analysis_in_r/dkpk3r6/?context=3) has plenty of them, for example) , but oh well I reallu liked this one.

datascience,"*Edit* I tagged this 'Education' but maybe that's the wrong tag... Maybe this isn't even an appropriate sub for this after all but still open to advice if anyone want's to help!

I'm trying to graph two trends against each other to visualize any relationship. As I write this, too, I realize I could probably just run multiple regression with all the data and look at the numbers but it would be nice to visualize it all.

[Here's a Gist](https://gist.github.com/plytheman/bd819fc23bbac33a25b83967d3acfec8) with my demo data and the code I've tried.

**The Data** I've got five temperature monitoring stations clustered in one location with *Diapensia lapponica* plants monitored at each station. The idea is to track how changes in temperature will affect the fist flowering date of the observed species. Unfortunately, our loggers are pretty inconsistent and at any given time one of the five sites probably isn't logging temperatures correctly. I got sick of trying to impute the missing data per site so I'm just averaging all five sites together then getting a yearly average temp. Likewise, I'm averaging the day of first observed flower at each site. (Also, I'm aware that the First Flower in 2013 is way off... I've still got to track down some missing observations and clean up data)

**What I'd Like** is to plot the trend of temperature against the trend of **D lapponica** first flower. What I'd expect is that as temps increase the first flowering day would decrease. In actuality, I don't think there's a strong trend with this species, but I'd like to get the graphing down so I can explore other sites/species.

**What I've Tried** Usually I just reach for Seaborn for trend lines but I couldn't find any way to plot two separate y-axes on one plot. I tried following some instructions on [creating trendlines with sklearn LinearRegression](https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-in-6-lines-of-python-5e1d0cd05b8d) but ran into issues with `.values.reshape(-1, 1)` demanding an integer and not a float. I tried forcing everything to be an integer but kept getting the error and I still can't figure out why. 

Regardless of that, I found plotly to have some nice and straightforward plots. As posted in my Gist, I can create a graph with OLS in plotly.express. I can use `.add_scatter()` to add data but it combines the y-axes and doesn't seem to allow for OLS. And lastly, `plotly.subplots` allows for different y-axes on the same graph but that doesn't seem to work with `plotly.express` and OLS. So I feel like I have all the pieces but they don't fit together.

Thanks for reading and any advice!",Can anyone help me make a plot with two y-axes and each data set has an OLS regression? Currently trying with Plotly.,1588088590
