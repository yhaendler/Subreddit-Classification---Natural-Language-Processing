books,"What a ride! This translated French classic novel was nothing short of grand and satisfying. At its core, it is a revenge tale but offers many layers of commentary and charectisation. 

Initially, I was intimidated by taking the task of reading this book due to its enormous size  (you can imagine my shock when I saw that it exceeded a thousand pages!) Also I typically do not lean towards picking up classics as they do not suit my reading tastes, not to mention my complete lack of connectivity with characters and the overall story. But Mr. Quarantine freed up my schedule and i found myself on the edge of a ledge, ready to take reading risks and take a leap of faith. And boy was I pleasantly surprised with the outcome.

Something about the author of this novel conveying much of the story through dialogue rather than endless narration hooked me. It was like watching a dramatization at some points. 

Given the sheer size of the book, i did not feel boredom or ennui (a word i learned from the book which means boredom or sadness caused by boredom). The plot was exciting, I rooted for the main character and was always amazed by the intelligance in which he constructed his plan for revenge. 
It had a satisfying ending too. 

In conclusion, I loved this book and i recommend it!

books,"Shadow of the Wind is beautifully written. Zaf√≥n's phrasing and plot weaving is some of the best I've ever read. ***However***, I feel like no one is talking about how he treats women vs men in his novels. I find it extremely toxic (as a man) the way he writes about women.

**Every single woman** that is introduced in his novels is fully described by their physical appearance, as well what role their sexuality fulfills for another man; while most men are described by only their character traits, with no physical traits mentioned at all.

I couldn't tell you what Daniel, *the main character*, looks like. But I can tell you that every single woman has their figure greatly described, or their breasts, or their ""yummy"" thighs being pinched - only to be later called out by **another woman** that men should be validly excused for their behavior, because they are ""too manly"" to resist touching a woman (in this case it is Fermin's nurse he aggravates, and his significant other of all people is the one excusing his behavior - no female author would write this passing comment into a scene).

Any time a woman is mentioned, Zaf√≥n rambles in what *reeks* of a teenage boy who has never been with a woman. Every woman is ""mysterious"" and an ""angel"" simply because of their superficial looks. Before any woman has even interacted with a character in his novel, they are placed on a mountain of a pedestal, simply because the male characters can't see females as real people: the female's only role is to be beautiful, and it's extremely degrading to normalize that line of thought.

Reading reviews on GoodReads by women who praise the book so highly is astonishing to me, there is no regard among them of this subject in Zaf√≥n's writing. No woman would or should consent to every single female character being extremely sexualized by a male author (Murikami reeks of this toxicity as well). I want to reiterate that as a man writing this, the novel reflects a huge problem of social conditioning - essentially the ""boys will be boys"" nonsense that has permeated our daily life. Women have thoughts, feelings, character traits **- depth** beyond their projected male sexuality. Not one female receives the respect and command Zaf√≥n gives his male characters in the otherwise great *Shadow of the Wind*.",I just finished Zaf√≥n's Shadow of the Wind - can we talk about male vs female roles in this book?,1587760464

The Latest Instalment 

Panting and whining the four terriers were straining to get inside the church. With wiry coats and little beards around their snouts they were not dainty dogs. They were tough little mutts, with scarred muzzles and tattered ears. They had been brought from a local farm for their rat catching prowess. A frayed rope around each of their necks was held in the hands of a scruffy dressed man. 

‚ÄúThey look keen,‚Äù the Professor remarked.

‚ÄúThey just want to get in there and do their job,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúBest ratters in the country.‚Äù

They would have to be Nigel thought. Four dogs were nowhere near enough to deal with the number of rats that had been in the church. There had been hundreds of the vermin. They had been everywhere. A writhing wiggling mass of furry bodies. The thought of the rodent that had climbed his leg made him shudder. 

A small hunting party gathered inside the church grounds. Clutching weapons they looked as if were about to go to war. And perhaps they were. They intended to take the church back from the vermin invaders. The vicar was amongst their number holding a shovel over his shoulder as he shared a joke with the gravedigger. A dozen other young men waited with spades, pitchforks, and shovels in their arms. Safely behind the church wall the rest of the village waited for the spectacle when the church doors were opened, and the rats poured out. 

The Professor crouched down and tucked his trouser legs into his socks. 

‚ÄúWhat are you doing, sir?‚Äù Nigel asked. 

‚ÄúIt will stop the little blighters running up my trouser legs. I do not want to have a rat biting my‚Ä¶‚Äù He looked up to see the vicar standing over him. ‚ÄúCan I help?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are ready to send those rats to hell, sir,‚Äù the vicar said grinning at the prospect. For some reason that Nigel could not fathom the hunting party looked to the Professor for leadership. A role the Professor seemed to be greatly enjoying.

The Professor straightened up. ‚ÄúRelease the hounds.‚Äù

The scruffy farmer loosened the slip knots around the terriers‚Äô necks. The dogs shot off to the church doors. Their noses pressed against the bottom of the door they snorted and whined in their desperation to get inside. One of the dogs started scratching at the bottom of the door as if it could dig its way through the wood. Keeping to one side the farmer leaned over and took the door handle. He glanced at the Professor. The Professor nodded and the farmer pulled open the door. The dogs were in before the door was even half open. There was clattering noise from within followed by high pitched squeals. Armed with their weapons the men poured inside. 

The church was empty. One of the terriers was proudly carrying a rat in its mouth. Another terrier followed it trying to snatch the rat from its jaws. The other two dogs darted around the church with heads down sniffing as they hunted for more rodents.

‚ÄúWhere did they all go?‚Äù one of the men asked clearly disappointed that the vermin were gone. They had been denied their sport. A few of the younger men had already drifted back outside. 

Gesturing for Nigel to follow the Professor headed for the nearest row of pews. Puzzled Nigel followed. There had been thousands of them crawling all over the church. Yet barring one unlucky rodent they had disappeared as if by magic. It was as if they had never been there to begin with.

The Professor knelt to study one of the vents. He passed Nigel a tuft of course brown hair.

‚ÄúThere is rat hair everywhere. They were definitely here. You can tell by all the faecal matter.‚Äù

Looking closer Nigel noticed the small brown pellets littering the ground and the pews. ‚ÄúBut where have they gone?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is the mystery.‚Äù

At the front of the church the vicar was instructing several of the young men to put down their shovels and to carry the coffin outside. The Professor headed for the pulpit

‚ÄúPity the vermin are gone. I was looking forward to slaying the little monsters,‚Äù said the vicar. ‚ÄúLeft quite the mess. I think in the interest for the family and the deceased we will continue the service at the graveside.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery well. My assistant and I will continue to examine the church. See if we can find out where the rats have gone.‚Äù 

One of the terriers stood at a door by the organ. Its hackles were raised as it growled. It let out an aggressive bark drawing the other terriers over to it. The dead rat was dropped as all four of the little dogs lined up in front of the door barking and growling. 

‚ÄúWhere does that door lead?‚Äù asked the Professor.

‚ÄúTo a set of stairs going up to the bells and then on to steeple. It also heads down into the cellar. Why? Do you think it is important?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe dogs seem to think so.‚Äù The Professor said crossing over to the door. He tried the handle. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs locked.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe keep it locked. Wouldn‚Äôt want anybody climbing up the bell to cause mischief.‚Äù The vicar rummaged in his robes and produced a ring of keys. He flicked through the keys to a long black key which he passed to the Professor.

The Professor unlocked the door and pushed it open to reveal a spiral stone staircase. Barking the dogs backed away from the open door.

‚ÄúSomebody get those dogs out of here,‚Äù the Professor ordered.

The farmer hurried over with his frayed ropes. He slipped a loop over the head of each dog and pulled the knot tight. He began to drag the growling and barking dogs away.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Nigel said. He reached for the rope for one of the dogs. ‚ÄúMay I just borrow him for a second.‚Äù

The farmer passed him the rope.

‚ÄúI said I wanted those dogs out of here.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne moment, sir.‚Äù

Nigel led the dog towards the door. The dog hesitated and Nigel pulled on the rope. The dog thrust its front legs out in front of itself resisting as he urged it on. The growls became whimpers as the dog fought to pull itself away from the open door.

‚ÄúYou have proved your point,‚Äù the Professor said. ‚ÄúThe dog is spooked.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs terrified.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we had better go and have a look. Leave the dog here.‚Äù

Nigel let go of the rope and the dog raced back to the farmer. ‚ÄúDo you think that is a good idea?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is nothing to fear. It is just a cellar. Come along, and you too vicar.‚Äù

The vicar was no longer smiling. His round face was ashen. He lit a candle and passed it to the Professor. 

The Professor promptly passed the candle to Nigel. ‚ÄúLead on.‚Äù

Nigel stepped onto the staircase. It was noticeably colder on the steps. He looked back. The Professor face was blank detached from any emotion. He was either not concerned or was hiding his unease. Nigel suspected the latter. The vicar clutched a bible tightly in his hand.

Holding the candle out in front of him Nigel slowly descended the stairs. He kept close to the wall where the stone steps were their widest. There was a dampness in the cold air and a mouldy smell. The steps levelled out and he stumbled forward. The cellar ran the whole length of the church. At the far end of the cellar were five flickering flames.

‚ÄúShould those candles be lit?‚Äù the Professor said.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the vicar said. ‚ÄúNo one has been down here for days.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen who lit them. Lead on Nigel, let us get a closer look.‚Äù

The Professor gently pushed Nigel forward. Nigel resisted like the little terrier had. He didn‚Äôt want to go near the candles, let alone be in the lead. The Professor shoved a little harder. 

The flames had distorted the candles into grotesque shapes of melted wax. Each candle had been positioned at the tip of a large star drawn on the floor. Laying on its back in the centre of the circle was a skinned rat, its large yellow teeth bared. The Professor touched one of the edges of the star then held his finger up to Nigel‚Äôs candle. White chalk dust covered his finger.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pentagram,‚Äù the Professor said brushing his chalk finger clean against Nigel‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúA symbol adopted and used by many religions over the millennia. In different faiths the points of the star represent different elements or attributes. The symbol appears in myths and legends from all over the world. It even appears in the Arthurian Legend Sir Gawain and the Green Knight to emphasis his virtue.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is the star upside down?‚Äù Nigel asked.

The Professor frowned. ‚ÄúThat all depends on where you stand. True from our position the star is upside down, but if you stood at the opposite end it would be the right way up. Drawn on the floor it is impossible for us to know which way the painter envisaged for it to be viewed.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if we assume the rat‚Äôs head is pointing upwards then the star is upside down.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat have I told you in the past about assuming? We must work on facts not on gut instincts. However, I will research the significance of the positioning of a pentagram when my texts arrive at the hall this evening. Now Vicar, do you have any idea who would have drawn this?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, sir. It shouldn‚Äôt be here. It is some sort of ritual.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is obvious. But by who? Who has access to this part of the church?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know sir,‚Äù the vicar said flustered. ‚ÄúAs I said we keep the door locked and there are only two keys to the tower. One I keep on me at all times.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the other key?‚Äù

‚ÄúKept in my desk draw in the rectory.‚Äù

‚ÄúI suggest as soon as we leave here you ascertain the whereabout of this spare key. Our hoaxer may have stolen it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think it is hoaxer.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. Somebody released the rats into the church, and they meant us to come down here and find this display. They are trying to trick us into believing in witchcraft.‚Äù

Nigel frowned at the Professor‚Äôs assumptions. How had the hoaxer gotten all the rats into the church and then had them all miraculously disappear? His quip about the Pied Piper was a more realistic alternative.

The candle flames flicked caught by a sudden gust. Nigel swallowed nervously. They were underground.

‚ÄúIt is just a draft from the stairwell,‚Äù the Professor said. ‚ÄúNothing to fret about.‚Äù

The breeze increased until it was ruffling their hair. One of the candles vanished. Chanting the Lord‚Äôs prayer, the Vicar ran for the stairs. A second candle blew out.

‚ÄòWe better go as well,‚Äù the Professor said his voice strained. ‚ÄúWe have seen all we need to. It‚Äôs been a long day best it we head back to the hall and speak to Mr Gates.‚Äù

Nigel did not need to be told a second time. He hurried after the Professor. Reaching the steps, the breeze ceased as abruptly as it had begun. The candle he held no longer flickered. Without stopping the Professor dashed up the steps. On impulse Nigel took one last look at the cellar. Only three candles remained lit. In the dim candlelight he had a fleeting glimpse of a cloaked figure crouched between the candles. Then as one all three candles went out concealing everything in darkness.

Is there a resource out there that lists all the tricky words so I can memorize their definitions before reading the book?

Or perhaps, is there a de facto Dune dictionary for the Kindle? I've tried some but disliked them.

books,"TL;DR: Let's not forget about the authors during Covid-19.

I bounce through r/books fairly regularly just to see what's up, but lately I've noticed a trend:

Lots of posts about fearing for bookstores during Covid-19. Lot's of posts fearing for publishers.

Not much at all, if any at all, about *authors*. You know, the people who *create* the actual books the other two peddle?

Roughly 80% of authors have to work a second job to make ends meet because they're already getting very small amounts of income from their books. Now with Covid-19 a lot of authors reported at the start that their sales had plummeted, some falling to almost nothing‚Äîeven authors that were largely digital (and yes, I know it seems like it'd be counter-intuitive, but Covid-19 seems to have shocked a lot of people into not reading).

Yes, your favorite bookstore/shrine facing rocky business is definitely alarming. But don't forget that ultimately it doesn't matter if it stays open or not if the authors that filled it with books leave the industry.

I'm not saying to stop posting about saving bookstores or whatever. Just keep in mind that the bookstore that's saved will having nothing to sell but old works if the authors negatively impacted by Covid-19 have to call it quits.

And if you're alarmed at all by how little authors make off of their books, consider rather that supporting a publisher that pays a pitiful 2% royalty finding and supporting publishers that pay 40-70% royalty, tipping authors on Patreon, or buying books directly from them.

books,"I've never written a book review or posted on Reddit in my life but I need to put this into the world so here it is:  


I knew *A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara was a sad book when I decided to read it. I decided to read it *because* I‚Äôd heard it was a sad book‚Äîbecause I‚Äôd heard it mentioned in videos as ‚Äúthat one book that makes you cry a lot,‚Äù that‚Äôs ‚Äúformative and important,‚Äù and that ‚Äúyou can instantly tell is going to be emotional.‚Äù A girl I‚Äôm subscribed to made a half hour-long video about it. I saw Antoni from Queer Eye wear t-shirts with the characters‚Äô names on them on the show. This is what convinced me to read it: that it is widely regarded as an impactful story that makes those who read it feel very strongly. I thought that if there‚Äôs a book that‚Äôs so powerful it makes those who read it cry and carry the characters‚Äô names around with them, then that means it must be worth reading. So I bought it off of eBay and read it. 

In hindsight, I chose to read this book at a bad time. It‚Äôs April 2020, the pandemic is happening, and I read it over the course of about 12 days in quarantine during which I had nothing but time to sit in my room and read it for hours straight and think about it for days on end. *A Little Life* has been on my mind every single day for over two weeks now. It‚Äôs what I can‚Äôt stop thinking about when I‚Äôm trying to go to sleep. Sometimes it‚Äôs the first thing I think of when I wake up, and I know I‚Äôve been dreaming about it. At first, this was because I was in the middle of the story and was immersed in what was going on, anticipating where it would go. Then, it was because I‚Äôd finished it and was consumed by how devastating it was. Now, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm genuinely angry that I let myself get so emotionally invested in a book that is in actuality terrible in every sense of the word. In short, *A Little Life* has deeply and personally upset me in multiple ways and I‚Äôve come to realize I won‚Äôt be able to fully focus on anything else until I put into words why. 

The blurb on the back of the book promises a story that ‚Äúfollows four college classmates‚Äîbroke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition.‚Äù It tells you what you‚Äôre about to read is ‚Äúa hymn to brotherly bonds and a masterful depiction of love in the twenty-first century.‚Äù Both of these things are lies and the second one, after a certain point in the book, almost reads like a sick, twisted joke. 

But before that, here is what I initially loved‚Äîand still do appreciate‚Äîabout this book. It is undeniably gripping from the first chapter to the end. Despite having little to no plot, just detailing the lives of the characters for 800 pages, this story kept me up reading until the sun came up more than one time. The first hundred or so pages gives such a solid introduction to (what you are deceived into thinking will be) the four main characters that you become invested in each of their lives, rooting for them individually along with dying to know more about their history and dynamic as a group. I knew *A Little Life* was different from any book I‚Äôve ever read pretty early on when I started to feel it in my chest. It‚Äôs a physical ache that makes my chest feel hollow and heavy at the same time. That feeling in my chest has only gone away a few times since I‚Äôve read the book, it keeps coming back, and it‚Äôs here right now as I‚Äôm writing this. I know this sounds so over the top but it‚Äôs true and that chest feeling is honestly the main reason I‚Äôm writing this, it makes me feel like it‚Äôs hard to breathe and I want it to go away. That feeling started as a combination of genuine love developed for the characters, pain from the truths about friendship and life weaved within the narrative that hit me with an intensity I wasn‚Äôt ready for, sick anxiety for what could possibly be waiting in the following hundreds of pages I still had left, revulsion at the scenes I was being made to visualize, and eventually just pure sorrow for Jude and all the people who loved him. It made me cry harder than I ever thought I could cry for a fictional story. Hanya Yanagihara put something into the world that will stay with me forever, and there is absolutely something to be said for that. 

But Hanya Yanagihara did not write a good book. She wrote a moving book, she wrote an unflinching book, she wrote a haunting book. But I‚Äôve learned through reading this and thinking about it nonstop that those things alone do not make a good book. She wrote a book that is not only dark and intense in subject matter, but that is excessive and visceral in its depiction of torture to the point of no longer being believable. The narrative is exhaustingly repetitive of Jude‚Äôs pain to the extent that no other characters get the room in the story they need to develop and grow. It becomes clear after reading scene after scene of nauseating violence and abuse that Hanya Yanagihara got carried away with detailing her protagonist‚Äôs suffering for what disappointingly seems to be no reason other than shock value and eliciting negative emotions from the reader. She is careless with the reader‚Äôs emotions, invoking pain in them just for the sake of it. 

**Here is where I‚Äôll start to spoil the book and won‚Äôt stop for the whole rest of the time until the last paragraph.** 

&gt;!Did Hanya Yanagihara think forced childhood prostitution wasn‚Äôt traumatic enough? Did she believe all the other horrors were necessary to make Jude‚Äôs past experiences warrant his current trauma? Not only does that seem to me like a slap in the face to all real-life sexual abuse survivors, but at a certain point it also begins to warp the narrative into something that is no longer plausible. For me, this point was when Jude hitchhiked from Montana to Philadelphia.  Every single trucker he waved down was a rapist pedophile monster? Not one of them had a heart? Really? And before that, every counselor at the home was either a rapist pedophile monster or turned a blind eye to their rapist pedophile monster coworkers? Then, as an adult, the one guy Jude finally decides to date is the most batshit crazy evil fucker in all of New York City? I‚Äôve never had to stretch my suspension of disbelief so thin as I had to to get through the Caleb part of the book. Jude‚Äôs abusers were cartoon villains, not characters, and this cheapened the story so much. !&lt;

&gt;!Out of these cartoon villains, Dr. Traylor especially was entirely unnecessary. He had no motives, no depth, no character; he only served as a vehicle to deliver further suffering to Jude, just to really drive it home that Jude‚Äôs childhood was bad, if that wasn‚Äôt already clear. Jude‚Äôs character already had a central tormentor in Brother Luke. He did not need another to make the reader buy his suffering; the manipulation, physical pain, imprisonment, and perpetual shame he endured at the hands of Luke was enough. It was visceral and painful and hard to read, but it worked within the story because Brother Luke and Jude‚Äôs relationship was one that the reader got to see develop and change over time. We understood why Jude trusted Luke, how Luke exploited him, and the horrifying world that Jude was forced into because of him. Again, this was enough. Of course the car injury needed to happen, but that could have easily been worked into Jude and Brother Luke‚Äôs storyline. With each bonus villain, Yanagihara unwittingly draws the curtain back and exposes Jude‚Äôs life story for what it is: a series of unthinkably awful, unlikely tortures imagined by an author trying to make her book as emotionally taxing as possible just to get a strong response. !&lt;

&gt;!Not only does the excess of Jude‚Äôs suffering make the reader doubt the reality of the book‚Äôs world, but it diminishes the impact of all the other characters and their experiences. Yanagihara created complex, beautiful characters worth exploring and then threw them to the rats. This, for me, is the most unforgivable part about A Little Life. The bones of a powerful story about close friendship are there, but they are buried beneath the rotting flesh that is what this book actually turned out to be. Did nobody edit it? Did they not say, ‚ÄúWait, what about those other two main characters? Hanya, did you forget about them? What about JB and Malcolm? Isn‚Äôt this their story too?‚Äù Even Willem is a victim of this. We meet them as lost twenty-somethings each struggling to make it in their respective careers, and then suddenly‚Äîwith a brief interlude for JB‚Äôs glossed over battle with addiction‚Äî they‚Äôre all famous and successful and bathing in riches.!&lt;

&gt;!Even though this shift in circumstances was a little jarring, (though did any of their characters ever really grow or change in all those years?) there was still a beacon of hope I looked towards: Part 5. Titled, ‚ÄúThe Happy Years.‚Äù Seeing that title in the table of contents, I was at first hoping, then at some point just assuming because of the lack of exploration of the friendship group in all the pages I‚Äôd already read, that this section would document Jude, Willem, JB, and Malcolm‚Äôs college years and I was so excited. Finally, a break from visceral descriptions of child prostitution and self harm, and now we actually get to see these friendships we‚Äôve heard so much about develop. Now we get answers to the driving questions, ‚ÄúOkay, we know JB, Willem, Malcolm, and Jude love each other with every bone in their bodies. But why? Yeah, we know they were randomly put together in a cramped little dorm in Hood Hall, but what made them friends? Why were they known as an inseparable group throughout campus? What did they do together? What emotional connections did each of these boys form with each other that set them apart from the other randomly assembled college kids, and how? What are the first memories they have together? What fights did they have early on, and how did they learn to reconcile? In what ways did they struggle trying to stay connected after leaving the place that brought them together?‚Äù I thought, ‚ÄúI know these four very different people love each other, but now I‚Äôll get to see how and why and when and where it all began. Almost 500 pages in, finally.‚Äù But you never get any of that. And it's crushing. !&lt;

&gt;!The scenes with all four of them were some of my favorites in the whole book. They were the most powerful; the ones that made me cry for good reasons and for bad. Reading the roof/fire escape scene, I was holding my breath. That was a part of the book where we saw each of the characters' personalities, where we really began to understand how their dynamic works. That scene is one of the only reasons I have an understanding of their dynamic at all. It shows how JB calls the shots, how Malcolm is apprehensive and cautious but ultimately always follows him, how Willem contests JB, how Jude desperately doesn‚Äôt want to be pitied by the others, how Willem cares about Jude the most deeply and looks out for him the most, how Jude and Willem each have their own roles within the group and relationships with the others but also have their own separate bond just between the two of them, how Willem will do anything for Jude, how Jude, on the inside, not only appreciates but needs Willem‚Äôs support to keep him from falling, literally and figuratively, to a dark, dark place. All that from one scene. !&lt;

&gt;!And the scene in JB‚Äôs apartment is the most harrowing of them all. It had me crying harder than any other part of the book. The struggles of every single one of them in that room felt so real; JB‚Äôs to maintain some semblance of dignity in front of his friends, Malcolm‚Äôs to keep the peace, Jude‚Äôs to accept what he‚Äôs just heard come from the mouth of a person he loves and is trying to help, and Willem‚Äôs to save JB but then to fight for Jude once it all goes down. Those last three lines sting. The whole scene does. !&lt;

&gt;!If there had been even just a few more scenes with the four of them that matched those ones in detail and rawness, A Little Life might have been the book it pretends to be. It‚Äôs so deeply disappointing to me that there aren‚Äôt. !&lt;

&gt;!Actual big spoilers coming up, if you ever want to read the book stop here, skip to last paragraph!&lt;

&gt;!I tried as hard as I could to accept Willem and Jude‚Äôs relationship for the sake of all the time and emotion I‚Äôd invested in these characters and their story, but truthfully I could cry thinking about how bad Yanagihara fucked it up. The way their relationship unfolded made me sick. Earlier in the book, she wrote that whole passage about the inherent value of friendship that I can flip to right now in three seconds as I write this because it resonated with me so much I highlighted the page,!&lt;

&gt;!‚ÄúLately, he had been wondering if codependence was such a bad thing. He took pleasure in his friendships, and it didn‚Äôt hurt anyone, so who cared if he was codependent or not? Why was it admirable when you were twenty-seven but creepy when you were thirty-seven? Why wasn‚Äôt friendship as good as a relationship? Why wasn‚Äôt it even better? It was two people who remained together, day after day, bound not by sex or physical attraction or money or children or property, but only by the shared agreement to keep going, the mutual dedication to a union that could never be codified‚Ä¶‚Äù!&lt;

&gt;!and then she put the characters of the only fully fleshed out friendship in this entire story in a romantic relationship? Not only a romantic relationship, but one that is in its early stages the most sickening, gutting thing to read as Jude is, devastatingly unbeknownst to Willem, made to relive the hundreds of rapes of his childhood by the one person he‚Äôs ever truly loved. There were truly beautiful moments in their relationship that I loved so much, but oh god, that part made me so sick. I could almost forgive it if it were done differently. In fact, I could forgive it entirely if it was done differently. If Willem and Jude had, from the beginning, had the seeds of those feelings for each other. If they were anywhere to be found. If we had gotten snippets of Willem feeling attraction towards Jude in college, and in their twenties, but pushing them aside because Jude is his friend, and he can‚Äôt feel that way about him, and Jude would never open up to him enough for them to become anything more than friends, and besides, he‚Äôs straight...right? And if we‚Äôd seen Jude feel inexplicably drawn towards Willem, wanting him in ways he never wanted the others, but he could never do anything about it because Willem is his friend, and he‚Äôs the one everyone wants, he‚Äôs the gorgeous lady killer and besides, he‚Äôs so fucked up from his childhood that he doesn‚Äôt ever want to put himself through the horrors of physical intimacy again..but he still can‚Äôt shake those feelings for him. If that had been written into the story not only would it have been forgivable, it would have been hard-hitting and powerful. And, if JB and Malcolm had actually gotten to fulfill their spots as main characters, we still could have gotten the friendships in the story that were promised. But, instead of that, what we have is two characters whose relationship was the strongest, most beautiful platonic relationship I‚Äôve ever read, the only relationship in the book‚Äîsave for Jude and Harold, Jude and Andy, and, upsettingly, Jude and Brother Luke‚Äîthat was actually explored at length, hastily morphed into a romance for one fucked up reason: so it hurts more when Willem dies.!&lt;

&gt;!Aside from the disappointing friendships and relationships in this book, the other, equally upsetting thing is what followed when I finished the book, closed the back cover, and couldn‚Äôt help but question, ‚ÄúWhat was Yanagihara‚Äôs intention in writing this story?‚Äù I understand why !&lt;

&gt;!Biggest spoiler yet!&lt;

&gt;!Jude killed himself. It broke me to pieces and made me cry like a child but, given the agony he endured every single day of his life, I will never argue that it didn‚Äôt make sense. But it really makes me wonder what her purpose was for putting this story into the world. This is a story about trauma. It‚Äôs a story about what a person‚Äôs life becomes when, from the very start, they are physically and psychologically broken down in every way imaginable. It‚Äôs a story about how that kind of trauma never ever leaves you, and how you have to find your own ways to cope just to make it through your remaining days. So what is her message for the readers out there who are like Jude? The sexual abuse survivors? The human trafficking survivors? The domestic abuse survivors? Those who cut themselves, those with eating disorders, those living with chronic pain? That even if you find an escape, become unimaginably successful, travel the world, and, most importantly, form lasting, meaningful relationships with angelic people who support you and love you from the bottom of their heart, that there is still no hope for you? That life for the abused is a lost cause? From what I understand, her message is that it never gets better. I think Yanagihara did something irrevocably dangerous: she created a book, that has now gained popularity and critical acclaim, in which she wrote suicidal ideation from the perspective of a suicidal person with such conviction that she forces the reader to begin to see his side; that killing himself would in fact end his pain, and at this point the reader loves Jude so much that all we want is for his pain to end. She writes from this perspective and then does not rectify it. Yes, she makes it clear that Willem and Harold and Julia (Julia, who got no characterization but deserved so much) and JB and Malcolm and Andy love him, and that they‚Äôre doing what they can‚ÄîI know they really could have done more, but I‚Äôm not going to go off about that because I understand Yanagihara was making a point about the agonizing struggle that is trying to maintain the balance between respecting your loved one‚Äôs autonomy/protecting their dignity and knowing when it‚Äôs time to cross a boundary in order to keep them safe and having the courage to cross that boundary; it‚Äôs part of the tragedy and one of the most realistic parts of the story, so I get it‚Äî but in writing what she wrote, she sent the message that unconditional love is not enough. And when Jude kills himself, what she‚Äôs said is that in the end, he was right. That suicide was the only thing that made his pain go away. And she is wrong for that. She wrote a devastating story, intentionally making readers connect deeply to her characters just so she could make it hurt when she ruined them, and she neglected to include even a shimmer of hope; the one thing essential to stories like this. In A Little Life there is only misery and no solace. And it is just not worth it. !&lt;

*A Little Life* is a cathartic book to read. It‚Äôs unforgettable. Between the despair, there are small pockets of joy and triumph within its pages that made my chest swell with good feelings instead of hollow from bad ones; the first time I cried, it was because of a happy scene. It reveals harsh truths in a way so subtle yet so strong it takes your breath away. It made me feel an aching, powerful love for the main characters. But, for all the above reasons, from the bottom of my heart: fuck this book. Thank you goodnight.",Why A Little Life Is Not Worth Reading,1587750081

And although it's not something I want to pursue professionally, I still love the idea of getting published in magazines (print/online) and on websites and getting paid for my work, sharing it with my very, very small social circle, collecting acceptances and rejections. I've even published a few times. Now that I have so much time during the lockdown, I've been thinking of reading magazines and submitting again. 

However, there's something I feel sort of ashamed about - I only read magazines when I'm trying to see if they publish the kind of stuff I like to read and write. If I like them, then I'll read dozens of their pieces to get an idea of what I should send them. However, if I do not have the desire to submit to them, such as over the last several months, when I was busy with classes and other stuff, I don't actively   check out magazines to read just for the pleasure of reading. 

And that makes me feel bad - that I read these magazines only when I want to get published in them. It somehow feels like I'm exploiting the efforts of the people who run them. When I do read them for fun, I just do that - simply read. No sharing on social media platforms because, as I said, I have a very, very small circle (and given how easily I get overwhelmed, I like it that way). And I tend to go for online magazines that don't need subscription, because, since I live in India, the exchange rate makes magazine subscriptions a luxury I cannot afford.

As a casual reader, I found myself laughing outloud while curled in a ball contemplating life for the first time since reading Catch 22 by Heller. I couldn't put in down and would highly recommend.

This isn't a review post but merely a reaction and would love to hear anyone else's thoughts on this book/Vonnegut. Thanks for reading!",Just finished The Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut,1587745540
books,"My primary genre is sci-fi, but I read a bit of horror and western as well. Lately I have been reading more westerns, which I think caused me to get Goodreads recommendations for books from the Hard Case Crime series. I have never really read crime, noir, hard boiled, or pulp books like the ones in Hard Case Crime, but I want to give it a try (I think the covers are what's REALLY drawing me in).

If you are familiar with the series, or have read any of the Hard Case Crime books, please let me know which books you think are best to start with. Or just your general thoughts on the series.

Right now I am thinking about getting some of the John Lange (Michael Crichton) books. I read a lot of Michael Crichton as a teenager and I think his books really got me into reading. Stick with what you know, right? I am also thinking about some of the Lawrence Block books. They seem to get favorable reviews.

Let me know what you think,

books,The last part of the story made me realize the importance of the self and the power of the mind. To me it was a realization of that to truly live happily a person has to live truthfully to themselves and not focus on the ideals or the standards that is popular but what they themselves believe.

One thing that I liked about this book was how each chapter, at least at the start, you we're trying to figure out how to connect it back to the main character, Eva. And at the end, the menu that she created for The Dinner seemed to reflect her life (as she said).
