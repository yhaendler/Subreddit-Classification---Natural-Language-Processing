Most of the time I read books in order to understand how life works, as well as the answer to many questions that I think you are confused about as well. The strange thing about this is that the words of many books or articles are consumed and even if they are correct, they are explained in a stupid way or something like that.  But this book I recently found while I am enjoying reading it is a book that is best said about decoding life, the best book explaining how to make people, the ocean, or even life smile at you, and it also answers the cosmic question, why do some people succeed and others not?

So, my question is in the title. My partner wants to get either a Kindle or a Kobo, but isn't sure which they should buy. Many of the reviews from this year pitch that the Kindle is better because of it's easy audiobook to ebook accessibility, but is that really the only upside? Neither of us loves Amazon one bit, and would prefer not to support them anymore, but if it's clearly a better product, we can be convinced. We're likely to be getting most of our ebooks from the public library, but will occasionally purchase.

books,"Hello, strangers on the internet! I just finished One Flew Over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest by Ken Kesey, in anticipation of watching both the movie and the new Netflix series, Ratched. Let me tell you, I am so full of conflicting feelings and opinions. I‚Äôd love to have your ideas on the book. 

Let me say a few things about my experience reading the book first. 

I can appreciate the book artistically, but I‚Äôll admit: the piece‚Äôs rampant racism and sexism (among other things) is very unpleasant. And the fact a white man wrote this story through the perspective of an indigenous character digs the knife in for me. It damn near ruins my entire reading experience. 

Now, some people might say I‚Äôm just too sensitive, that I‚Äôm ‚Äútriggered‚Äù by content outside of my own moral perspective‚Äîand there‚Äôs some tiny truth there; I don‚Äôt typically seek out works that I think promote bigotry and hate‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not sensitive. I have a whole degree in anthropology and have read about histories that would make One Flew Over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest look like child‚Äôs play. No, the bit for me that makes this book SO FRUSTRATING is that it promotes fighting evil institutions while actively engaging in the institutions of racism and sexism. The hypocrisy pains me. In my mind, it‚Äôs impossible to separate the book‚Äôs theme from its execution, even if it was written in the 60‚Äôs. 

I could be generous and say that Kesey meant for his work to have this tension, but I‚Äôm not sure that textual evidence supports this. And there‚Äôs something wholly unappealing for me about a white man complaining that people are getting oppressed by an institution that readers see as best embodied by women and black men. It sounds far too much like a dog whistle for white supremacy. 

Anywho I won‚Äôt prattle on much longer. 

TL;DR: How do we come to terms with the racism and sexism in a book that‚Äôs supposed to be about resisting evil institutions?",I‚Äôd love a mature and respectful discussion on One Flew Over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest,1602712891

books,"Listen, I understand why it's a classic. I do. But the entire novel felt like I was reading through Orwell's personal paranoia. I understand the implications of a government like the one described, the lack of true freedom, the lies told, etc.  But I thought the plot was pretty lackluster. And then, of course, there's that section that reveals the ""truth"" about Big Brother and Oceania and all that, which I personally found excruciatingly boring. The content therein could have just as easily been given to us in the course of the plot itself. Actually, some of it HAD been given to us previously. I guess, overall, my question is this: If this is your favorite book...why?",1984 is overrated,1602708632
books,"But the overly grim-dark tone was a bit of a turn-off in more ways then one.

To be clear, I agree it's a phenomenal book and McCarthy's straight to the Point writing style is perfect for realizing this intimate father/son relationship you spend all 300 Pages with.

My biggest, really only, criticism is with it's near relentless bleakness.

That's not because I'm against dark stories or anything (though though these days...), it takes skill to do well and I still think it was in this case.

The thing that bugged me I guess was partly the fact that I myself am a bit burned out on the whole ""everything is terrible! Humans are the real monsters!"" trope.

At this point my reaction is just: are we? Are most humans just terrible people that will figuratively and literally eat each other when the chips are down a-la the Joker?

What I wanna see is a story that puts an equal focus on the fact that people do often come together in times of great stress as much as they will tear each other apart. 

I just feel like it's the easy, cool, edgy thing to resort to ""Humans are the real monsters, I'm so deep you guys""

Now to be clear, there are other good people in the book, but that kinda brings me to my second problem, and keep in mind this is just the feeling I got reading the book, I'm not making any statements of fact here.

When the vast majority of the book is just ""everythingisterribleeveryoneisevil!!"", I feel like the writer kinda shows their hand whenever things do lighten up.

""Oh, how convenient they managed to find food at the right moment. How convenient that a group of good guys happened to show up right after the father died""

I guess people are only monsters when the plot needs them to be, huh?

It's just because the rest of the book is so dark, hopeless and depressing that I have a harder time buying some of the brighter part, given the world that's been established.

That's pretty much all I have to say. Again, I still think it's a great book, I just think there's no need for me to repeat the things we all agree are good about the book.

I hope this made sense.","[Spoilers] I liked ""The Road"", but...",1602708455
books,"When I was I kid, I used to read all the time. It was rare I didn't have more than one book on the go. However, as I got older, it became harder and harder to read.

Recently, I was diagnosed with ADHD explaining why I found it so hard. 

Over the past few months, I've been collecting techniques for reigniting my love of reading. Most of these tips are aimed at the jittery, unfocused ADHD brain.

If you've got any tips or suggestions to add, I'd love to read them.

**1) READ DIP IN BOOKS**

Short stories, comic strip collections, poetry, flash fiction and the like will give you quick wins and sense of completion. Read a single poem or story and then put the book down. Well down. You read! 

**2) REMEMBER, IT'S OK TO NOT FINISH A BOOK**

Only 6.6% of people finished a Brief History of Time. 25% finished 50 Shades of Grey. The Great Gatsby only hooked 28.5%. Everyone does it, don't beat yourself up. Celebrate the wins!

**3) USE DIFFERENT DEVICES**

Phones, e-readers, hardcover, softcover, tablets. They're all acceptable methods of reading. If one method starts boring, switch to another. 

**4) READ IN DIFFERENT PLACES**

Stand up, sit down, walking around, in the bath, inside, outside. Mix it up. I read Alice In Wonderland on the treadmill at the gym. I fell off twice.

**5) GO LARGE PRINT**

Books with larger print are easier to focus on. Your eyes are less likely to dart across the page.

**6) SPEED READ!**

Your brain moves too fast. Why not make your eyes faster? Practice speed reading techniques to speed up your comprehension. You can start by running your finger along the page from left to right as fast as possible. Your eyes will follow your finger and avoid jumping ahead. IMPORTANT: If you're comprehension goes down, you are not speed reading.

**7) TAKE NOTES**

I read with a postcard or scrap of paper nearby. I write down character names as I go in case I forget. 

**8) COVER THE PAGE**

Hold a postcard under the line you're reading to stop jumping ahead. 

**9) USE READSY**

Readsy is an app that shows you one word at a time in rapid succession. If you stop paying attention, the book goes on without you. Reading just became a full body contact sport! (This won't work with all e-books.)

**10) READ A FEW BOOKS AT ONCE**

I'm currently reading Gogol, Raymond Carver and David Walliams! If one gets a bit much, I move to another.

**11) SET A TIME** **LIMIT**

Set yourself a ridiculously achievable goal of reading for 10, 5 or even 1 minutes a day. ONLY read that much. Once you've got into the habit of reading, up to the daily limit. It doesn't matter if you skip a day, just don't skip TWO.",Learning to read for pleasure as an adult.,1602708285

books," I enjoyed this book for what it was - a sweet, lighthearted tale about a divorced couple. The story revolves around two couples, resulting in a love triangle between Sara, the young narrator's mom, with Jai (the narrator's father figure) and Anil (Jai's co-worker and rival at work). The narrator, a 12-year-old girl named Pari) is determined to set Sara up with her father, Jai, while Tisha (Anil's daughter) tries to do the same with her father. What ensues is a hilarious, heartwarming story about love, understanding, and compromise.  


The title of the story, 'three nights and four days' is a reference to the life-changing trip that the four of them embark on. What is supposed to be a relaxing vacation becomes an exciting, high-stakes romantic adventure for the couples involved, filled with drama, awkward interventions, and complicated plots to solve this love triangle. The story is easy to follow but the author works tensions well. It did feel a little awkward in places, but I can understand that when the narrator is a 12-year-old and attempts to discuss complex concepts like love. In that sense, it becomes cute to read a young girl's explanation of love and romance.  


The novel is sweet, in an innocent, child-like manner. It makes for a good quarantine read, and has a cute ending at the end. For those who are looking for a feel-good, warm book, I would recommend this novel.

There are plenty of 'history' books which raise hackles on the neck of many historians who don't like being reminded that certain civilisations were simply inferior to others and were, accordingly, conquered. Criticisms range widely, but usually center on 'Imperialism is Bad, M'kay'. That's not history, that's revisionism.

My latest contribution is Bergman's '*Rise and Kill First*', the title of which is taken from a Talmud verse. It covers 70-90 years of 'Targeted Assassinations' by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. The author has gained access to, otherwise inaccessible, records and interviews with key players during this period and concentrates on Israel's policy of simultaneously trying to make peace with their neighbours while also eliminating the leaders it saw as threats to the nation or the peace process in the Occupied Territories, neighbouring States, hostile States and 'Friendly States' without compromising its international reputation and moral virtues.

books,"Does anyone feel that maybe reading a book is not that good as it is said? Or is it overhyped?  Because it takes a lot of time to read a book and one can also go through that journey by watching a film related to that book, or maybe you are not even required to go through the journey.

And please don't troll me for this. It is just a random thought and I only want to know your view.",Why read books?,1602690152

books,"What I had in mind was something like: imagine there's a page with the text of the book and the other ""page"", or the other half of the screen, was images that are automatically taken from google, maybe even images related to the book you're reading. Like if you're reading fantasy maybe it shows you nice fantasy vistas or artistic drawings of elves or dragons.

Idk, maybe it's a naive desire.","I have ADD so while I love books it's hard for me to focus on them. I had an idea of what might help but I'm not sure if it exists. Basically, a program to read ebooks that also displays various images on the right half of the program.",1602688516

books,"I have thought about this a long time and can't remember the title of a book I enjoyed as a kid, all I can recall is there were brothers, one was paralyzed in a wheelchair from military service I think and they listened to stories on the radio so I guess it took place in the 50s? I believe they were spying on a man who moved in next door and seemed suspicious, that's all I haveü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I think the younger brother was saving cereal box tops to send in for a spy ring(or maybe he got the spy ring from a cracker jack box). I just remember enjoying the book as a kid and would like to re-read it. I am in my 30s and read this sometime in the early 90s as a kid, again sorry for the very minimum details but if this sounds familiar to anyone I would love to hear!","Really slim details but need help with a book I read as a kid, can't remember title.",1602686948
