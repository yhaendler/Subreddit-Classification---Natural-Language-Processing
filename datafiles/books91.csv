books,"Hi guys,

I'm looking for two types of book.

First, I'm looking for very powerful books that have a great sense of depth and meaning behind them. The type of book that leaves you thinking about it for a while. However, not something that's too long. I have a very short attention span so anything from like 200-400 pages would be great. 

And second, something similar to Donna Tartt's Secret History. I fucking loved that book and love the whole dark academia genre.

books,"I just finished reading Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler. I really enjoyed it but some of the content was hard for me to read (I.e. cannibalism, rape, constant murders, and people being skinned). Has anyone read anything else by her? I’m curious to read more of her work but am unsure if I can stomach reading any more tough/gory things like cannibalism/rape/etc. It was a bit much for me to stomach and I can’t read more of that kind of stuff.

books,"“I’ve been in twelve European countries; I’ve seen Moscow, Paris, and London, among other cities, and experienced Bolshevism, Parliamentarianism, and Fascism close up, as an ordinary person among ordinary people. Are there differences? Yes, substantial ones. But from what I can tell the distinctions are mostly ones of form and coloration, of the rules of play, not differences in the greater or lesser fortunes of common people, which Candide is so concerned about. And the individuals I encountered who were meek, subservient, and uninterested in any existence other than the one they were born to didn’t seem any unhappier in Moscow than they did in Paris or Berlin—all of them lived by adjusting their souls to the prevailing conditions.”",Reading “A Woman in Berlin” has been absolutely heartbreaking and has changed much of how I view the world.

books,"So like everyone else on the planet I studied the Great Gatsby at school. I loved it, and have read it a few times since. I’ve always had a great appreciation for Fitzgerald’s skill at conveying a national mood in a story, but my recent re-reading was a totally new experience.

The parallels between the 1920s and 2020s are a cliche at this point, and it’s only 2021, but I do think this last year gives a new kind of reading to the book where you feel the atmosphere so readily it’s almost dizzying. I did some academic reading recently about the cultural amnesia of the 1918 influenza pandemic, because (along with WW1 of course) it was this staggering global trauma, but it undoubtedly contributed to the glorious, dangerous hedonism explored in Gatsby. 

Between the traumatised hedonism and rampant socio-economic inequality that, imo, form the axes of the Great Gatsby, I honestly think the collective experience of the last year(s) lends a whole new dimension to reading this classic.",Re-read The Great Gatsby the other day and the last year has completely changed how I read it,1617058217

books,"Prior to my reading of the book, I had heard many folks raving about this book and how fantastic it was, so naturally I decided to give it a try. My fellow Redditors, I was not prepared for the feelings this novel engendered in me. It just radiated warmth, charm and whimsy.  

Story-wise this is defintely a unique one. It follows a man who has a job that entails writing reports on orphanages that house magical children. One day he is given a task of going off to an orphanage where the ""dangerous"" magical children stay...
The book sparks discussions about whether we should condemn groups of people based on their exterior or look deeper and if objectivity is really the best way of going about matters that have to do with people's livelihood. It shows the negligence of bureaucratic control  and the corrupt nature of people fearing what they cannot understand. There are parallels that could be made between some situations in this book and our world which adds to just how much of a good layered story this book is. The writing is brilliant.

The characters are all fantastic (well not all but the main characters). Linus Baker you poor bastard, how many times did you have to suffer an almost heart attack at the sight of Anti-Ch-, sorry, _Lucy_? But in all seriousness I loved reading from his pov and his self-deprecating disposition and his desire to flee certain situations but finding himself unable to made me cackle alot. This book is flipping funny yall! Its crazy the amount of times I burst out laughing! 

Talia is my favourite character out of all the kids. I love every single one of them though. They are all unique, loveable, charming and absolutely brave. 

Overall this is a story I will be revisting in the future and one that is sure to stay with me.",The House In The Cerulean Sea is a wonderful and warm book,1617051656
books,"I finished *Snow Crash* a few days ago, a book I’d been meaning to read for a long time, and I largely enjoyed it—even if the experience of reading it was, as I’ve found with a lot of foundational cyberpunk novels, not exactly mind-blowing because of much of what they describe has more or less come to pass. I suppose that’s mind-blowing in its own way.

But something that really took me by surprise was the extended and detailed sex scene between Y.T. and Raven, and I’m still trying to work out what to think about it.

Just as a recap of it’s not familiar and/or stale in your memory: at a fairly late point in the book, one of the two POV protagonists, Y.T., a fifteen-year-old girl, has sex with one of the antagonists, Raven, whose precise age isn’t mentioned but is implied to be around 30.

As I was reading and growing increasingly uncomfortable, I started trying to figure out why the scene was in the book at all—or at least why it was described in as much detail as it was. 

I first thought about *Lolita*, which is one of my favorite books, but Nabokov renders those sex scenes in such a way that they’re either implicitly or explicitly gross, and Stephenson doesn’t seem to be going for that effect.

I thought about its plot function, but from what I can tell, it mainly works in that sense to moot Raven, whose role in the plot had for the moment run its course (until the very end of the novel).

It seems possible that it’s there because Stephenson is using this structure of history repeating itself, what with the long exegesis scenes about Sumerian mythology. Given that he emphasizes the incidences of father/daughter incest in that mythology, there could be something there, but I haven’t tried to map the Sumerian references to the novel’s plot beyond what Stephenson explicitly does.

I guess I’m looking for a reason that what I certainly perceived as an icky scene but one which really didn’t seem to be intended as such has a purpose beyond titillation, especially because it’s the only scene of its kind in the book (while there is a lot of gory violence throughout). 

And I wonder if anybody has thoughts about that?",The sex scene in Snow Crash,1617051573

books,"I picked up this book March 28th. Today, March 30th, at 1:42 am, I started continuing what I finished the past 2 days.

I used to write. I used to love literature more than anything. How damn lucky am I to pick up good books to make me fall in love all over again with reading?

I cannot stop crying for the last 80 pages of the book. I have not seen the movie nor do I intend to watch it. I know very well that most movie adaptations of books aren't as good. Especially when it's from netflix. I wish this book stayed as a book, and no movie franchise. It could've been our little secret. ""Secrecy is life.""

No matter how confusing Finch's character was, I still somehow understood him. I felt his pain... with just words that I read. He could've had a good life with Violet. He just had a very bad childhood, a very traumatic past... He deserved happiness for once after a while. He deserved love. Even someone as he who thought he couldn't be loved, could be loved after all. I cried for the bits and pieces whenever Finch talked negatively about himself. As someone who's an expert to self-loathing, I understood it too well. I wanted to tell him the opposite of the things he said about himself. I wanted to hug this fictional character so bad. You're not too bad Finch. Please, live. Stay.

If only I could change the outcome of the story.

As for Violet, I couldn't feel anymore sympathetic. She lost two important people besides her parents. Two different situations too. She's unbelievably, undeniably so fucking strong. I was proud when she started slowly started living again during Finch was alive. And I'm glad she still kept living after his death. I don't think I'd be able to myself if I were here. Grief is too much. It consumes you, until you're empty just like she was for some time. That's why I say she's strong. She took all that negative energy to help others in a similar situation of Finch and herself.

Non-spoiler summary:
I give it a 9/10 only because it hit too close to home for me. It may seem the cliché ""oh the popular girl falls in love with the weird boy"" thing, but you need to trust ths story line. They're both weirdos, just in different degrees. Both are lost wanderers who seek for what it's like to have a perfect day after all the bullshit they went through. It's a YA adult book that deals with these warnings: depression, suicide, traumas, and abuse.

books,"When I read Wuthering Heights, particularly when I watch film depictions (because it's ultimately a point the directors and writers have to measure and come to a decision on), I contemplate how extensive Heathcliff and Cathy's intimacy went before she married Edgar in the book. As per the time period, the book doesn't mention anything indicative one way or another so there is a lot of mystery to me about whether their romantic love was reinforced by intimate sexual love. Personally, I prefer the idea that their relationship was passionate yet unrealized physically, because so much of the emotion I feel emerges as Cathy realizes her regrets as she is dying. At the same time, I'm not gonna lie, part of me likes to imagine they were doing the dirty in her childhood bedroom. But I can't imagine her making the choices she made with Edgar if they had already been so intimate. 

If I were to theorize, I'd say that Heathcliff and Cathy were platonic through to her marriage, but Heathcliff developed sexual feelings (obviously) well before Cathy did. It took her dying to realize that she wanted Heathcliff all along?

books,"The common assumption is the more books you read, the better. That especially takes the form in a books-per-year metric; you see posts here all the time where people outline the 150 books they read in a given year and how it was such a great, enriching experience. I know many of those posts are made purely out of a passion for reading, but a lot of times it's reduced to a contest to race through as much content as possible.

As the years have gone on, I've tried to increase the number of books I read every year. I'm not going to great lengths; I think in 2015 I was at 30, and last year I read 38. So this year, I picked 40. That's immediately put me in this mindset that I have to read about a book a week, so I can give leeway to longer or more difficult reads. 

However, picking most the books I read based on ""how quickly can I read this?"" has been a drag. I still like most of what I read, but I'm choosing based on length, genre, and how contemporary/readable the prose seems. I'll log a book and it'll say I'm now one behind, so the next one has to be even more readable. And the reading itself is less fun when you're calculating ""ok, I really need to push through another 20 pages before bed or I'll fall behind.""

There's something quite enjoyable about sitting with a book for a long stretch of time. Now this very well could be my own sentimentalism getting the better of me, but I do enjoy the long journeys that these epics can take one on. Though some book endings feel like saying goodbye to old friends, there's an unshakable feeling of reward that one gets, a wave of satisfaction from completing a goal. In general, the long haul can always be a fond experience to look back on warmly. 

But like any long journey, there can be lulls. And that's where my love for shorter works shine through. 

I almost feel a sense of childlike whimsy when tearing through a shorter book, especially when a longer one gets a bit dull. Maybe it's the naughty feeling of running away from the ""responsibility"" of the book you started. A novella can almost feel like a literary tryst, a quick escape into another world that feels refreshing and exhilarating (when chosen correctly of course). If one *really* sucks you in, you tear through it so quickly that it feels as if BOOM, you look up and realize it's already over! Where did the time go? That feeling of satisfaction also hits you quicker, and it usually leaves me refreshed enough to dive back into the longer work I was originally visiting, but now wide eyed and rejuvenated. 

I've never really read several short works back to back, but I now wonder what *that* experience is like! I'm currently in the long haul with *Crime and Punishment* (I'm a third of the way through; fantastic book so far!), so I might try it afterwards. But I can already feel the thirst for a short work coming! I've been eyeing *Candide* by Voltaire and I do hope it will make a nice getaway when things start to get a bit slow. 

TL;DR - Literary epics can always be incredible, but sometimes things can get a bit slow. Novellas and other shorter works, like a weekend trip, can recharge one's batteries and leave them content and able to conquer their longer books with a new sense of excitement.","In praise of the novella and other ""short books"" (i.e. anything under 200 pages)",1617033488

books,"Hey! I just found this sub, and after a little lurking, I hoped that it could provide some help!

As a short recap, I’ve always been a bookworm. I always was reading something, no matter where I was. I remember reading books so good that I would go to the bathroom with them (lol) and get in trouble for staying up too late to read. However, as I started to get older, I started to read less and less. Not because I don’t love reading, but because it’s hard to find a book THAT good anymore. I have a focus deficiency, so it’s hard for me to sit through and finish a book that’s not captivating from start to finish. 

TL;DR: I’m looking for book recommendations that are captivating from start to finish, in any genre.",Feeling discouraged in finding a very good book,1617032835
books,"...and what an amazing book it was! I saw the trilogy a few years ago, I even saw the first movie twice so I decided it might be fun to read through the original novel and I wasn't disappointed at all. It might one of the best books I've ever read. The characters are all memorable, the story is very well writen and it has some very well described and iconic scenes that the movie trilogy adapted flawlessly. I absolutely love Michael Corleone's character development from this naive guy nobody respects and that wants to stay as far away from the family's business to Vito Corleone's sucessor and probably the most powerful man in this world of organized crime.

A few years ago, I lost a lot of my posessions to a flooded basement, including a box of books. Unfortunately among them was a copy of a book my mother read to me when I was very young.

Now that my mother is in poor health, I find myself thinking about the book more and more often, I go through our bookshelves every few days thinking maybe I will find it hidden somewhere. 

I'm sure it may seem silly to some, but as someone with aphantasia the physical objects associated with vivid memories are vitally important.

I have gone searching for the book, but geography (UK title, I'm in Canada) and time (1986) have not made it easy. Copies have appeared on the internet, but it seems like it's been a while since any have come through.

If anyone knows of even a damaged copy of this book, I would happily purchase and ship it from you for (almost) any cost. 

Thanks for your time, and if you know of any subreddits that may be more appropriate for this topic, please let me know!

books,"And jheez... I'm not sure I can finish it. 

I've just read a paragraph on how women haven't contributed anything towards science, philosophy, inventions etc in the past ""100,000"" years and we need to stop pretending that we have. Baring in mind I'd just read Rachel Ignorofskys wonderful book Women in Science. I'm just not sure what message she's aiming for here. Sure men have dominated the sciences, but women *have* contributed to science and *have* been overshadowed and sometimes plagiarised by men. He argument is that we need to stop blaming men for our failures and lack of contribution. I just think it's strange to ignore the work that women have done historically, especially when women have had nobel prizes taken from them by their husbands? Is the aim to be funny? 

One of the first paragraphs in the book states that small grade feminism issues are just as important as FGM or feminism in third world countries which... I don't know how I feel about. I think the book came out as, or just before, the new wave feminism, which unfortunately became very white washed. I get that the book is about her life and of course she won't be able to comment on issues that she hasn't faced - but to make a direct comparison with your life and that of someone who has suffered FGM and to say my issues are just as important? Just don't make the comparison. It's okay to tell your story but don't try and justify it like that.

Maybe if I had read this 10 years ago it would have been revolutionary, but reading this now after beginning to expand my feminist reading by including different voices and backgrounds from my own just feels weird. Even as a white woman I don't really relate to it.

What have other peoples thoughts been on the book? Has anyone read it more recently compared to 2011 when originally published? Let me know your thoughts and opinions.

books,"Book number 2 of my read around the world was Broken April by Ismail Kadare and reflects upon Albania’s famous blood feuds which are still, in some shape or form present to this very day.

Kadare has a simplistic and raw writing style, much like the characters in the novel. This enables the reader to build strong visual imagery of largely uncomplex individuals. Additionally, Kadare also does a fantastic job of building in wider Albanian context including the conflict of tradition and modernisation throughout the industrial revolution of Europe. From a contextual perspective, although unclear, it is suggested that the book is set sometime in the 19th century. Therefore, worth bearing in mind across Europe we are seeing vast industrial revolutions, modernism and wider, more far-reaching education amongst the masses.

The book follows 3 key figures through their respective journeys of a region in Albania called the High Plateau. The High Plateau is governed under the *Kanun* which are ancient rules of life in largely remote areas of Europe, absent from technological and educational reform:

·  Gjorg a young man in Northern Albania is from a remote village governed by the *Kanun,* the reader is guided through his killing of a local rival family member and the following process governed under law, until his ultimate demise (slight spoiler).

·  Diana and Bessian are newly married and honeymooning in the High Plateau. Kadare ensures the reader is aware of their shock and ultimate disgust of the ways in which the mountain people of the High Plateau live their lives, through poverty and blood feud.

The physical crossover of these characters is fairly limited to one brief encounter. However, the connection between Gjorg and Diana is profound and shapes the journeys of the two parties thereafter. Kadare positions the relationship between Gjorg and Diana as intrigue and almost lustful in nature. Personally, I see this as a metaphor between the conflicts of traditional and progressive lifestyles with the mutual intrigue between the two, rather than the foundations of a love story someone may immediately assume.

Kadare seldom uses explicit methods to indicate conflict between traditional society and the on-going modernisation of much of Northern Europe at the time. He does however, make reference to this through the types of literature being published and read within higher society and also the disgust at its existence from uneducated paupers working in the royal dwellings.

Finally, one part I particularly liked within the novel was the importance placed on one’s guest. In Broken April once you accept a guest into your home then their life is quite literally in your hands. If they should be harmed whilst your guest then it is up to you, the host to avenge that harm. How’s that for a burden!?
