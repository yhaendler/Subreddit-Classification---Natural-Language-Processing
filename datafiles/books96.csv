**Enlightenment Now**

Sometimes referred to as the “age of reason,” it was a turning point in human history and would go on to influence the future development of Western society. It offered a remedy to the rampant ignorance, terror and paranoia people had been victim to.

Prior to the Enlightenment, bad weather was blamed on witches or angry gods; forests were the domain of monsters; and countless people were tortured and killed in the name of religion. Much change was needed and through the Enlightenment four themes began to emerge: reason, science, humanism and progress.

Reason means that there are things in the world that are non-negotiable – that no matter what your so-called sacred text or authoritarian leader says, only reason can dictate the ultimate right. A good example is slavery. Prior to the age of reason, slavery was seen as a fact of life, but as the values of Enlightenment spread, reason shook the foundations of this barbaric practice and eventually helped bring it down.

With the emphasis on science, people began to value knowledge. Early versions of neuroscience, psychology and cultural anthropology opened the door to humanism, which offered a secular way for people to understand and respect one another. Humanism offered a moral footing to acknowledge that genocide and murderous conquests weren’t acceptable.

One look at media outlets would have you believe that war, violence, crime and tribalism mentalities prevail but, the fact is we’re still experiencing the benefits of the Enlightenment. Whether it’s life expectancy, crime rates, level of happiness, wealth or quality of life, just about all measurable indicators of “a good life” have been on the rise and shows no sign of stopping. 

At the start of the Enlightenment, the global average life expectancy was 29 years. Post-Enlightenment, the life expectancy of people around the world has increased exponentially. It doesn’t matter if you’re 50, 60 or 70 years old – you can now expect to live longer than ever before.

In 1845, a 30-year-old person in Britain could expect to live another 30 years while an 80-year-old could count on about another five more. In 2011, that 30-year-old could expect another 52 years, while the 80-year-old could expect nine more years.

This improvement is global: in Ethiopia, a ten-year-old in 1950 could expect 34 more years, but a ten-year-old today can expect 51 more years.

Life can also be expected to be lived in better health than that of previous generations, thanks to medical advancements that have led to the entire or near eradication of  many diseases such as polio, smallpox, and measles.

Famine is nearly a thing of the past. 150 years ago, children in Sweden were starving to death during long winters. 45 years ago, 35 percent of the world was malnourished. That number dropped to 13 percent in 2015. This is due to the science of agriculture giving us the ability to use less land and water to grow more nutrient-packed grains.

Prior to the Enlightenment, it was common for a nation’s poor people to be forced into harsh labor for little to no pay. In 1820, close to 90 percent of the world was in extreme poverty. Between 1820 and 1900, global income tripled.

Nations began using trade to improve international relations, putting aside religious differences for a mutual benefit. This attitude was taken up by many countries and, gradually,  helped wealth spread across the globe.

Between 1900 and 1950, the world income tripled again, and took only 33 years to triple a third time. With growth a period of inequality is expected . But as time goes on, this inequality naturally levels itself out, this is called the Kuznets curve. 

In European countries during the early twentieth century, the average amount of earnings spent was 1.5 percent. Now, an average of 22 percent is spent on social programs and relief for the poor. This is known as Wagner’s Law which states that with economic growth and development a nation will experience an increase in the activities benefiting the public sector

There’s little room for optimism in the ongoing war being waged in Syria. Conservative estimates have put the number of deaths, in 2016 alone, at 250,000 people. But if you want an accurate assessment of how violent we are globally these days, the data shows that war is a lot less rampant than it used to be.

You might think there’s an unprecedented number of refugees today, too, but if we go back a few decades to 1971, we see that the Bangladesh War displaced 10 million people. In 1947, the shift in India’s borders turned 14 million people into refugees. And, during World War II, 60 million people were forced to flee.

The Enlightenment believed problem-solving was the central to progress and resolving disputes. In 1945, the United Nations was formed, and, with it came the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since then, this organization has been influential in helping settle disputes, along with the continued trade and commerce agreements that have helped form international relations.

So, for 70 years, wars have been few and far between. And in 2009 they became significantly fewer after a number of civil wars drew to a close, including ones in Angola, Chad, Peru and Sri Lanka.

With wealth rising across most nations in the world, there’s less of an opening for militant groups to form an uprising and try to convince the people that they should join in a revolution. With increased wealth, a nation can begin offering better health care and education, and the incentive for civil war is greatly reduced.

This is what we can see in the data from around the globe, and we see fewer incentives for crime as the world becomes a more prosperous place.

In the 1970s, things didn’t look so good for democracy. In West Germany, Chancellor Willy Brandt called democracy a “peculiar holdover with no future.” But little did Brandt know that just around the corner was a huge push toward democracy that would find one nation after another adopting their own version of the Enlightenment form of government.

Democracy is very much the result of Enlightenment thinkers looking for a better form of government than the reign of terror that had plagued the world since biblical times. People were tired of slavery, torture, human sacrifices and the public mutilation of dissidents.

Another thing people wanted to avoid was leadership breakdowns, such as those that led to the bloody revolutions in China and Mexico in the early twentieth century.

In this sense, democracy is a way to protect people from both tyranny and anarchy, and it’s proven to be the one form of government with healthier economic growth, fewer genocides and better education.

As of 2015, there are 103 democratic nations, a pretty good number, considering that it fell to 12 during the fascist uprisings of the 1920s.

The shift toward democracy has been a boon to the Enlightenment agenda and, since it’s allowed the world to become more cosmopolitan, it’s also reduced racist and sexist attitudes.

Simply put, racism and sexism are untenable arguments, which means they can’t withstand scrutiny and there’s no rational or reasonable defense of them. In a more cosmopolitan world, with more travel and more people crossing paths, people are far more likely to be exposed to enlightened ideas and have their unenlightened assumptions challenged and refuted.

So it makes sense that the modern world has far fewer ethnic and racial discriminatory laws on the books. In 1950, half the world’s nations had these laws, but by 2003, that number was down to under one-fifth. And with the exception of Vatican City, women can now vote everywhere that men are allowed to.

The news offers no shortage of things to freak out about. But if you do some digging and uncover the real problem, there’s not as much reason to panic as you think. Case in point: terrorism.

The actions of ISIS and other terrorist organizations are abhorrent, but are Americans right in thinking that ISIS is an immediate threat to the existence of the United States? The reality is that an American is more likely to be killed by lightning or a bee sting than a terrorist. If we look at the worldwide statistics, all people would still be 125 times more likely to die in an accident than at the hands of a terrorist.

People are afraid because of the negative bias and selective reporting that rule today’s  media. The press serves to exaggerate the severity of many existential threats.

Contrary to what many believe science is not racist, sexist or responsible for the Holocaust. Science has a long history of being attacked by ignorance and misunderstanding, as well as by people trying to advance their own agenda. One such claim is that science fueled Hitler's Nazi agenda, even though Hitler was anti-science, anti-reason, anti-progress and anti-Enlightenment. Some claim that science led to the Holocaust, an argument that hinges on the Aryan myth, which was invented by Arthur de Gobineau, promoted by Wagner and embraced by Hitler.

These days, attacks on science are likely to be thinly veiled attempts to discredit a legitimate concern, such as climate change.

One of the greatest challenges facing humanity is cutting back on CO2 emissions by 50 percent by 2050 and eliminating them completely by 2100. Otherwise, the threat of global temperatures exceeding an 2 degrees Celsius is extremely likely, which will cause permafrost to melt, raise sea levels and cause all manner of catastrophe.

In Europe there has also been a movement of people pushing back against the values of the Enlightenment, but there are reasons to believe that this too will pass. Populist parties, which favor nationalistic, tribalist values, have only managed to get about 13 percent of the vote, while ultimately losing as many legislative seats as they've gained.

The Brexit vote may have been alarming, only 29 percent of people with a college education voted in favor of it.

According to WIN-Gallup International's Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism, even in traditionally religious countries, like Poland, Turkey and Russia, there was an average nine-percent decrease in people who identify themselves as religious between 2005 and 2012.

With each successive generation, we see more people relying on reason, science and humanism as the source of their values.

While religion needn't be at odds with Enlightenment, progress can be impeded when people base their values on the interpretations of sacred texts.

Despite peoples doom-and-gloom outlook and the media’s negativity, the data tells a story of triumph over the past 100 years with no reason to believe this progress will be reversed.","Just Finished ""Enlightenment Now"" Summary Feedback",1619300812

books,"I just finished *Hench* by Natalie Zine Walschots and thought it was only okay. I have a lot of thoughts and, because I’ve only seen positive responses to it so far, I wanted to share mine and see if anyone else felt the same way. (Lots of spoilers below.)

First, I should state upfront that I’m not a huge comics or superhero fan. I’m a casual watcher of Marvel/DC/X-men movies and I enjoy The Boys (tv show, haven’t read the comics), but that’s more of an alternative take on the genre. Anyway, I assume that this position might have biased me.

My two big complaints are with the way premise was applied and the writing style.

**First, the premise:** The book asks us to take the idea of superheroes seriously: i.e. it thoroughly explores the collateral damage of superheroes and the engine that would exist for them to function in the world; the trauma that would cause; the ripples on society; etc. The problem I felt is that, while the book took the concept of superheroes seriously, it didn’t do the same thing with villains. Why are the villains there to begin with? And why did Auditor choose to work for “bad guys”? There’s a scene near the beginning where she’s shocked that her villain boss would kidnap a kid. But he’s a villain! Isn’t that what he’s supposed to do - be evil? I found this kind of inconsistent logic very frustrating. It felt like a mix of comic book and real world logic, where on the one hand the villains and superheroes were kind of silly caricatures of cartoon-type characters, but then on the other the story wanted us to consider what kind of person would be a superhero to begin with and what kind of damage that does to both the superhero themselves and the people in their way. 

**Second, the writing:** I tend to be very picky with writing style, but I really did not like how this was written. There was kind of a repeating rhythm of scenes. For example, a character would say something, then the other person would react by smiling, laughing, or grinning. I can’t believe the number of times someone would grin or laugh in response to something happening. I think if this had happened just a few times I wouldn’t have noticed, but it was pretty much the only format for character interactions. There were also a lot of repeated phrases, like something “clicking into place”, “clicking in her mind”, etc. And lots of unrelated metaphors, which I don’t strictly consider to be a bad thing, but it was used over and over to the point that I found it jarring. There was no variety in sentence structure, character dialogue or language, descriptive phrases, etc. Overall, I found the writing to be really clunky.

Taken together, the issues with how the premise was applied and the problems with the writing style meant that I didn’t really feel the interiority of the characters. I mean, yes, I understood why Auditor was angry at Supercollider. But other than that, I don’t understand why she wanted to work for the bad guys in the first place, or why many of her colleagues were doing so as well. Especially the Meat, since they’re pretty much signing up for grievous bodily harm. For that matter, why were Leviathan’s employees so willing to risk life and limb for him when everyone found him terrifying? (Excluding Keller) I also didn’t really see a justification in the story for Auditor’s colleagues loving her so much. For example, Leviathan’s assistant (Melinda?) went from being a stranger to Auditor in one scene to hugging her affectionately in another. They don’t work directly together, and that kind of relationship is pretty unusual for colleagues, so it didn’t really make sense to me.

And, final thing that irked me, why did the Draft perform surgery on Leviathan in the first place? Were they trying to manufacture a villain on purpose? I didn’t see a direct explanation for this in the book but it’s possible it went over my head.

Overall, I thought it was a really fun premise and the plot was pretty good, but I couldn’t get past the inconsistencies and the writing style.

books,"Hello! 

Long story tldr at the bottom.

So I'm white and a first grade teacher at a title one school of mostly students of and staff of color. We have a Student Support Specialist who's been at our school for almost 20 years. She's held almost every position at our school you can hold without being a Principal or asst. Principal and does amazing things for our students. She told me a story the other day about how a student came to her one day talking about this book his grandma had in her garage about the Civil Rights Movement and brought it in to show my coworker, we'll call her Mrs. C.

Mrs. C took the book and cleaned it up, it was molding, for the student and his family. She then made a photo copy of it to keep for herself. She showed me this book while we were talking about the systemic racism that is prevent in the school system and the struggles students and staff of color experience at the hands of well intentioned white staff. She didn't have to take the time to share so much of herself and her life with me and it was a real show of trust for her to open up to me this much. There is also a decent sized age difference between me and her. I'm in my late 30's and male, she's in her early 60's. I very much look up to her as a mentor in many ways and want to find this book for her as a gift. 

Now that the back story is outta the way, the book was published by Ebony Magazine, I'm not sure of when and I don't know the title because she didn't photo copy any of the title pages, just the contents. The book is both written words and pictures, covering all of the major events of the civil rights movement. 

Can anyone point me in a direction that might be useful? I've spent about 4 hours searching google but can't find what I'm looking for. I'd go to the library for help but thanks to COVID our libraries are still closed except for pick up of online orders. 

Thanks!

This just might be the single most impactful book I’ve ever read. This is due in a large part to me being a biracial man (black/white) living in the US where racism is still very much a problem. And as far I’m concerned, this is the exact reason this book isn’t taught in schools. It fills black men, like me, and black women with pride and knowledge. The kind of knowledge that empowers us to heights that the ruling class isn’t comfortable with. I think this is why we are taught in school that Malcolm X was important to the Civil Rights Movement, but not regarded as a role model. We weren’t taught to admire him. At least, I was. I can blame my Nebraskan upbringing on that. That was another thing that blew my mind. I grew up in Omaha and no one talks about Malcolm X being born there. It’s like they are ashamed of it. If even half of the black man in America were as well-read and militant and fearless as Malcolm, we would be living in a vastly different country right now. For the better. And growing up, I was taught that he was white-hating extremist who shouldn’t be admired. Fuck that. 

I surprised myself in believing this, because in school, we are taught that this isn’t the right way to go about change, but I found his message of “by any means” to really strike a nerve with me. It’s 2021 and racism is still an issue and we’re all being exploited, regardless of race, by capitalism. We’re all aware of it but not many are actually willing to commit to the actions that will actually change our way of life. I don’t advocate for violence but if non-violence isn’t working, well, let’s just say white people, historically, were willing to do drastic things to get their freedom. They went to war with England. They committed genocide to acquire the land. They enslaved black people to build it. They went to war with each other over those slaves. That’s not me saying the Native American genocide and Trans-Atlantic slave trade were justified, by any means. That’s me saying that I believe, like Malcolm, that any white person who reprimands black people for looting or rioting or trying to fight fire with fire, is the biggest hypocrite walking this Earth. 

This autobiography also further cemented my anti-Christian/anti-religious frame of mind. I grew up in the Christian church and started having doubts in my teens. It started raising more questions than answers. By the time I was eighteen, I was fully anti-religious, in favor of agnosticism, and I find myself on a spiritual journey nowadays. 

But something that never even pieced together in my mind until Malcolm broke it down was how Christianity was used to mentally enslave black folks. It made them focus on heaven in the afterlife while white people got to enjoy heaven on Earth, right then and there, off the fruits of their labor. It also made them scared to fight back because “God will send you to hell for murder”. It made me that much more anti-religious. I don’t mind people that are but life experience, and this book, have shown me that religion is a tactic used to keep masses of people in fear and smoke and mirrors. It’s used to keep them from using their energy to better themselves and realize self love is far greater than worshiping any false god. It’s used to separate people. Once you take away your religious lens on reality, you see how truly connected we all are. A racist doesn’t have this crucial lens on reality. A Christian doesn’t have this crucial lens on reality. 

All in all, I wanna thank my brother for recommending me this.",Just finished The Autobiography of Malcolm X. WOW!,1619288096
books,"I've heard amazing things about the Wheel of Time, but the book never really meshed with me. 

I enjoyed when the party split up and we hung out with Perrin. I liked a lot of the dynamics around how the characters interact, little things like Perrin and Rand complaining that the other is so much better with girls made me smile every time. I liked the small town feel at the beginning of the book, it was cute and I appreciated the setup to everything kind of falling apart for them.
But outside of that. . . I just kept losing interest. Constantly dipping into dreams got boring after a while since the result was the same save for a prick of blood at two points. It seemed like everyone they trusted ended up being good (Save for one clearly sketchy peddler) and everyone they distrusted being bad. I felt my mind wander on more than one occasion because I felt like they weren't in any danger. The story seemed to meander and focus on minor details more often than not, and the action sequences were. . . Unclear? I can excuse that if I assume that they get clearer as the characters gain more experience. The climax also felt like it kind of came out of nowhere. It just kind of ramped up and then ended predictably. I just felt so unengaged 

Outside of that, I'm just overall disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the book is a solid 5/10, readable, not unbearable, and enjoyable at times. Just kind of dull and unengaging. Are the rest of them like this? I read that the first book is one of the best in the series, which is not a great sign to me.

As for my experience with fantasy, I've read the entirety of the cosmere, dipped my toe into the Arcane Ascension series, loved Gentlemen Bastards so far, and have struggled repeatedly to properly start Lord of the Rings. I'm clearly not the most well read, so I'm happy to hear from others on if I should give it more of a chance.",The first book of Wheel of Time was. . . Disappointing?

books,"So I read Catcher in the Rye in my ninth grade English class as many American ninth graders do, and being a kid with kind of weird taste in books I liked it a lot and paid a lot of attention in the class discussions.  My teacher was always pointing out weird little details and over explaining them throughout the story, which I chalked up to it being a generally weird book, until the last day of in class discussion.

It was in THIS class that he went back over the little details he had been pointing out throughout the story and presented to us his analysis, which was that Holden had been sexually abused at some point in his childhood and his repressed memories were causing his depression.  Because I was in ninth grade and he was TEACHING us this classic book, I assumed that that’s what everyone agrees the story is about...like how people agree that Nick is gay in the Great Gatsby.  

Flash forward to YEARS later I’m having a discussion with some college friends about books we read in high school and how they were taught to us.  Naturally Catcher in the Rye came up and I was like “yeah the subtext of that book is really dark for kids, I can’t believe they had us read it at that age.” And everyone looked at me like I was crazy.

Apparently NO ONE else has been taught this reading of Catcher in the Rye and my English teacher was taking some crazy liberties with us as a class. 

So I guess my question is; is there any merit to my teachers theory? Would other people agree with it or was he literally just insane? Because he very well could have been.",My English teacher has some explaining to do about his take on Catcher in the Rye...,1619287671

books,"Hey all, I would appreciate some advice please

I have a very dear friend who adores books, I do too, though I haven't been able to read much recently. We used to bond over plot discussions, and as of late it hasn't really been an option for us. I haven't seen her in ages due to Covid, nor do I think I'll get to see her again soon. Her birthday is near, and I was thinking of gifting her my new favourite book, that I discovered in the time since I saw her last.

However I don't want to just give her the book, it seems somewhat hollow for someone with a tonne of books who, while the may understand the intent and sentimentality, also may not even like the book in the end, since its not her usual genre.

I was thinking of trying to make it a bit more special, like adding a personalised bookmark, maybe a sachet of special tea, writing a note in the front, but beyond that I'm stumped.

Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated x
