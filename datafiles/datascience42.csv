datascience,"Hi everyone,

I am an accounting major who recently discovered the field of data science. I got a basic idea of what data scientists do by learning basic skills like Python, and I liked it. I would like to pursue a career in data science and apply it to business (marketing, finance, banking, accounting). However, I don't know which path to choose to get a job in data science. It is possible, but it will take **great** effort. Here are my thoughts:

Masters Degree: The closest and cheapest program to me is based on geographic studies, which is unrelated to my career path but can be ""customized"" by taking 3 accounting elective classes. I found two other **amazing** online programs, but I will not be able to afford them. I want to get a Masters to show that I have the necessary skills even though I come from a non-STEM background, and I don't want to go for the ""customized"" geographic data science masters just so I can say I have a Masters in Data Science. Also, I found that all Masters degrees are asking for resumes, and some are asking for work experience.

Job: I could skip everything and try to apply for a data analyst job with just a BS in accounting and some self-taught skills necessary for the job. However, I may have trouble getting hired with a non-STEM background, and the time I waste looking for a job could have been spent studying toward a masters. However, if I do get a job, I may raise enough money to afford a high-quality program that will significantly increase my chances of getting promoted rather than staying in a beginner-level job. My employer could even contribute to the cost of the Masters.

What should I do first: Job or Masters? Will work experience make studying for the Masters easier/better? Will work experience increase my chances of acceptance to a Masters program? Is there a chance that I will lose motivation to go back to school? Should I apply to Masters right after undergrad?

datascience,"When Implementing custom loss function how to make it invariant to the `batch size`. For example lets say `dice loss` is being implemented. The formula does not clarify how to deal with the `batch size`. It is worth noting that according to this formula, the value of `loss` will increase if the `batch size` is increased. The obvious intuition would be to normalize the `loss` value using `batch size`. I have two question in this context.

1. Is it theoretically valid to normalize the `loss` using the `batch size`?
2. How to normalize? 

* For example, In case of image the `tensor` at hand is `4D`. The `dice score` / `loss` can be calculated for _each image_ and _each class_ resulting into a `2D` tensor.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now the aggregated `loss` can be calculated as the sum of all elements in the `2D` tensor divided by `batch size`.

* Alternatively, we can ignore the `batch size` from the beginning and generate per class `loss` in a `1D` `tensor`. Finally sum the elements and divide by `batch size` to get the aggregated `loss` value.

**Is there any fundamental difference between these two approaches? Which one is correct (if any)?**

datascience,"I work for a mid-sized manufacturing company in the semi-conductor industry and they want me to work as a BI analyst which is a completely new field for me. What they are especially interested in is KPIs and dashboards. For this reason it is planned to introduce Power BI (which should be connected to Microsoft Dynamics, NAV). However, I totally hate Microsoft products in general because of the catastrophic UI/UX and I wonder if Power BI is the best tool. I may have the chance to suggest a different software. What do you think is the best software for BI/dashboards? Or would you say Power BI is excellent software?",Experience with Power BI and Possible Alternatives,1595438510
