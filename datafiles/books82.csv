books,"Hello,

I am trying to remember the title of a book I started reading (but never finished) a few years ago. I don't remember much, but maybe someone out there will know what I'm thinking of. 

Here's what I can remember:  
It's about a family that is torn apart when a husband and wife are arrested for taking money from a fundraiser that was to help a town recover from a disaster. They owned a business in the town and were prominent members of the community before the arrest. They have kids who go to live with one of the wife's sisters (sister ""A""). The wife has two sisters, and one is coming in from out of town (sister ""B""). Sister ""B"" is a lesbian who is lying to her partner about going home and has an eating disorder. The oldest of the husband and wife's kids had something to do with their arrest, she turned them in or something. It's written in first person, but switches between the many characters in the family. I thought about it this evening and just cannot remember what it is called... I'd love it if someone can help me remember.

books,"I was thinking today about the book Jurassic Park, which is an amazing bit of storytelling, as testified by the film’s popularity, but which I remember noticing even when I read it as a child, is probably not what most people would consider well-written stylistically. IIRC, pretty much every bit of direct speech took the form of “Character said ‘...’”, for example, never ‘he muttered under his breath’, ‘she whimpered as she struggled to hold back tears’ or anything remotely expressive or even varied, which made it feel very plodding and slightly childish

Contrast, say, any of P. G. Wodehouse’s Jeeves and Wooster stories, which pretty much all have the same plot and caricatured characters, but have such wit and such crispness of prose that they’re an utter delight to read, despite the lack of any real substance.

I know there are examples of books which are explicitly co-authored by two or more big names, but it made me wonder how common it is to have the writing of a book divided up amongst different authors and sub-authors who have different responsibilities dependent on their skills. It just seems to make sense to me that no individual author is going to be excellent at storytelling, character development, dialogue, structure, prose and everything else, but that covering all bases with a suitable collection of ‘author-editors’ might be easier to do.

The total labour involved might be higher, because you have the story outline and character sketches written out separately, then have to have parts reworked or rewritten by different authors at different stages, rather than just have one person sit and write it (although I suspect a lot of authors go through a process like this as a single person anyway) but I see it as similar to the difference between an indie dev coding a game on their own and a big software house having a huge team on a AAA title. While a single lead author would probably have to have final say and ultimate creative control for anything to get finished, I don’t see that it would be necessary for them to write the whole thing themselves.

I know George R. R. Martin said something in one of his acknowledgements about there being many bricks that go into building a wall, in a way that seemed to hint that he has a writing team who do the detailed work and he designs the stories and puts them together, so that made me wonder if he and other writers do something like this.","How often are fictional books actually authored by a team, even if only one author is credited?",1613341659

I'm interested to know if there are other people out there who were once big readers, who noticed that their reading volume plummeted when internet message boards/social media became widespread.

I have been thinking about how mediums change, and I think that for many people, the needs that would have once been filled by magazines have been entirely rerouted to reading twitter, instagram, and reddit.  

I have also noticed, on a personal level, that when I deleted my facebook, I was able to focus and read more frequently.  It made me realize that I had replaced my ""reading"" time with ""reading facebook"" time. 

It makes me think about what draws people to reading in the first place.  Is it a curiosity about the inner lives of others?  A desire to feel informed and up-to-date?  I think that in reading for pleasure, there IS an element of wanting to connect with the characters, and with the author - it's a parasocial relationship in the same way that OnlyFans is a parasocial relationship - it feels personal, but is not really tailored for just you.  It's for anyone who chooses to read/buy the book. 

I suppose I'd be curious to hear others' experiences of their own social media use, and how that impacts their reading.  I know there is the very simple correlation of only having so many free hours in the day, so that doing one will necessarily impact the time available to do the other.  However, I'm wondering if it isn't something deeper - that on some level, people read books to feel a connection with others, and that social media might ""quench"" that desire.  I'm wondering if others have noticed that some people have the attitude that if an idea isn't found or expressed online, it doesn't really exist.",Reading in the age of the internet,1613335008

She definitely sets it up for a second book and I think she said she wanted to write several books about Alex Stern.

Has anyone else read it? If so, what were your impressions? I liked certain aspects like the lore of the houses and the way Grays were depicted, but I wasn't into the pacing so much. I also felt like the Bridegroom conclusion wasn't earned. Not enough bread crumbs and it felt kind of rushed near the end. The time jumps in the first half of the book were good and kept me wondering what was going to happen, but somewhere a little past halfway it switched up the pace. It also felt like a lot of exposition. 

I've also heard a lot of criticisms on the character development and was wondering if anyone could chime in with their thoughts? I guess if you consider character development to equal change then there wasn't too much. What do you all look for when you ask for a ""fully fleshed out"" character?

I wish she had focused on one or two houses rather than mentioning eight and then kind of only ""using"" four. I'm going to let it process a little more before I give it a final rating in my mental journal. I'd say, right now, it was at least good enough for me to tune back in to Alex Stern's journey but I won't be waiting for a midnight release.

* It's so refreshing to read high fantasy that doesn't rely on gendered violence. The main society depicted in the books does have interesting gender dynamics - only the women are literate, for example, whereas men can only use glyphs.  
* I want an author to fool me. I love to guess where books end, but I tend to be disappointed if I'm right. Sanderson has managed to throw in so many curve balls that I've never been able to guess the ending. His endings are known as ""Sanderstorms"" because so much happens at the end.
* I love when an author hides clues throughout the story. It's incredible to me that ONE LINE in the first book (that I completely missed the first time through) has massive implications for other books. 
* The Cosmere universe itself is so well-plotted. The books are all tied together in loose ways - you don't have to read them all to understand the story - but the Easter eggs are fun. 
* Like all other Sanderson books, the system of magic is unique and detailed.

books,"It's a snowy Christmas eve and Reverend Cherrycoke decides to tell the legend of surveyor-astronomers Mason and Dixon to a boisterous group of cousins, nieces, nephews, and in-laws. This religious framing sets the tone for a story which quickly exceeds the bounds of all reasonable doubt and dives into a realm of pure abstraction, before concepts and events are ""reduced to certainty"", a phrase used throughout the book to describe the astronomer's goal of mapping the stars unto an unknown land.

Like Pynchon's other work, this book is crammed full of possibility, potential, and suggestion but never conclusions, and never a coherent and unfragmented view.

Mason and Dixon become, rather than central figures of the story, orbit its periphery. At its center is an amorphous conspiracy between East and West at the heart of the American continents which translates approximately to the debate between the inward focused and outward focused spirituality. Mason, for one, actually travels to the artic pole in order to travel to this inner-facing world and speak to its inhabitants.

Here is how our narrator joins the celestial and the spiritual in a note from his daybook:

""As Planets do the Sun, we orbit' 'round God accord to Laws as elegant as Kepler's. God is as sensible to us, as a Sun to a Planet. Tho' we do not see Him, yet we know where in our Orbits we run, -- when we are closer, when more distant,-- when in His light and when in shadow of our own making... We feel as components of Gravity His Love, His Need, whatever it be that keeps us circling. Surely if a Planet be a living Creature, then it knows, by something even more wondrous than Human Sight, where its Sun shines, however far it lie""

Through Gravity, as explored in his other texts, Pynchon sees the purest expression of the Godhead which connects us, literally, to every single planet, star, or scrap of dust in the universe by an invisible web unbroken since the big bang. Because we must have all at one point inhabited the same space, the same white-hot primordial marble that existed perhaps even before time itself, or, more specifically, outside of time.

Pynchon explores the paradoxes of the Big Bang through various metaphorical constructs. Mason and Dixon, for their part, are consistently entering spaces whose interiors are larger than their exteriors, the conspiracy of Jesuits in America has yet something to do with a infamous event known as The Black Hole of Calcutta where hundreds of British colonialists where compressed clown-car style into a jail cell, forming for one night a shifting, seething, blob of human.

Our astronomer/surveyors are asked, by the light of the stars, to create a map of lines that might express that unnamed will upon an unknown continent. By contrast, the Chinese conspiracy means for the map of the new world to express some ""Sha"" the ""inner dragon"" of the land, a preset order which humans discover rather than create. Why look outward when looking inward is how one gets to the essence and could that essence not be secular in nature? These views are diametrically opposed and Cherrycoke rather drily dismisses the deistic milquetoast idea that God is some featureless fairy dust expressed in and expressing ""everything"".

For this novel, Pynchon discards any pretense to a ""real"" story. The miraculous and sub-miraculous enjoy equal footing with the quotidian minutae of astronomy and tree felling. The astronomers are just as curious about their observations of the transit of Venus as they are in their own astrological horoscopes. Yes, even professional astronomers cannot help but be seduced by ""astronomy's wanton younger sister"". The characters can admit freely of a certain amount of coincidence between their horoscopes but never that the coincidences are random. These minor coincidences could easily be the work of minor deities in the same way that the single greatest coincidence (the sum total probability of all things happening exactly as they did) must only be the expression of a God. We are introduced to speaking Dogs, mythical electric eels which provide flashes of revelation, an invisible vibrating duck in love with its rival and sublimating its erotic impulses into an ethereal seraphic duty. We meet axemen from distant cults North of the northmost nation on secret missions, Satanic weapons manufactures, anachronistic Jesuit technology, and Chinese sex cults (just to name a few).

Pynchon explores and lends a myth to this eternal consciousness through creating, and discarding entire worlds, plots, theories, just as soon as he produces them as if by maximizing the number of digressions in his story he can, for the brief moment of creation, take part in joy of the greater engine which produced the universe.

Yet, this story, is not merely repeated for an unseen audience. It is Christmas eve after all. The children and adults listening to his story are quick to point out impossibilities and possible errors. One cannot, for example, accept the inclusion of all these talking animals without imagining some allusion to The Garden and The Fall. Cherrycoke expresses a deep appreciation for spiritual fabulism as a way to bring out the inner ""truth"" of a story. Mason and Dixon is much, much more than a quasi-historical adventure novel. It is a daring, cerebral, chaotic, and completely unexpected spiritual journey into the center of America. One too dense and rich for me to give it any justice.",Mason &amp; Dixon: Pynchon's Gravitational Theory of God,1613323008

books,"# 1) Perception, action, and will are the keys to turning obstacles to our advantage.

When faced with an obstacle, most of us get angry, fearful and frustrated. We think it will derail our plans and hinder our progress. But obstacles can actually become advantages, and far from limiting us, they can lead us to success.

How?

To turn an obstacle into an advantage, we have to focus on three things.

First, we should focus on our *perception* of the obstacle. If we can see an obstacle in the right light, we can reveal the hidden possibilities we can use to our advantage.

This was the key to the oil baron John D. Rockefeller’s success. During a financial crisis in 1857, Rockefeller, only 18 years old, watched how those who panicked behaved, and observed what they did wrong. By analyzing their failures, Rockefeller was able to see the obstacle – the Panic – in another way. He was then able to perceive the advantages the crisis offered, take action and start on his way to becoming one of the world’s richest men.

But perception alone is not enough. When you are faced with an obstacle, you also need to respond with the correct *action*.

The correct action is born from the combination of creativity and flexibility. For example, at the beginning of the twentieth century, Amelia Earhart wanted to become a great pilot, but an obstacle stood in her way – back in those days, women just didn’t become pilots. So she took a mundane job to survive, but kept looking for creative ways to accomplish her dream.

One day she received a call saying that someone would fund the first female transatlantic flight, but she could only be an unpaid passenger. Though this was far from what she wanted to accomplish, she accepted – and this jumping off point led to a career as a great aviator.

After identifying the best way to perceive an obstacle and the best action to overcome it, we use our *will* to persevere until the obstacle has been overcome. 

# 2) In order to perceive obstacles clearly, we must learn to see objectively.

When you encounter an obstacle, how do you respond? Do you think the world might be against you, and that nothing ever goes your way? Instead, you should be thinking about taking a step back, looking at the situation objectively and thinking, “What can I do to turn this obstacle into an advantage?”

If we look at them in this way, even the biggest obstacles can be turned to our advantage.

For example, in the 1960s the then celebrated boxer Rubin “Hurricane” Carter was falsely accused of a triple homicide, and sentenced to jail for life. But as he entered prison, he resolved to not let his circumstances overwhelm him, and instead tried to see how he could make the best of it.

First, he vowed to not live with the injustice, but keep fighting to overcome it through the court of law. Then he turned his limited physical freedom to his advantage by using his time inside to study history, philosophy and law. Carter’s case was eventually overturned and he was released after 19 years. Carter left jail as he had entered it, a free man. But in addition, he had also used the time to improve his education and himself.

So how can we achieve this objective perspective?

By learning to detach yourself from your own personal – and highly subjective – view of the situation. You can do this by imagining that you are advising a friend about overcoming the obstacle. What would you say to them? How would you let them approach it?

Or you can take after the Stoics, a group of philosophers from Ancient Greece. They would imagine how a sage – a person of perfect wisdom – would react to the obstacle. In that way, they would explore hidden sources of wisdom that they didn’t consciously know they had. 

# 3) Uncontrolled emotions cloud our judgment and perception.

Our first reactions to an obstacle are usually anger, frustration, anxiety and confusion. Though natural, such emotional outbursts actually make it harder for us to deal with obstacles because not only do they prevent us from judging the situation objectively, they actually make us *see* it differently. So if we want to turn our obstacles into success, we have to learn to control our emotions.

How?

The key to controlling our emotions is to steady our nerves.

A famous role model for steely nerves is the Civil War general, Ulysses S. Grant. He was once being photographed by famous photographer Matthew Brady when he nearly lost his life. As there wasn’t enough light for the photo, Brady asked an assistant to open the studio’s skylight. But the assistant accidently broke the window, and large shards of glass fell right next to where Grant was sitting. If he had panicked and jumped from his chair, he might have been seriously hurt – but Grant didn’t flinch, and sat calmly in his chair as the shards shattered around him. By controlling his nerves, Grant prevented his emotions from getting him hurt.

So how can we gain control over our emotions?

By preparing ourselves for what can go wrong in any situation. This allows us to remain calm no matter how much external events may change.

NASA has realized how important this is. A panicking astronaut is the single largest factor that contributes to potentially life-threatening mistakes in outer space. That’s why NASA prepares its astronauts to respond to any possible obstacle until their reaction becomes automatic. This allows them to deal with stress when anything goes wrong with the initial plan.

Emotional responses to obstacles blur our judgment, thus making it impossible to turn obstacles to our advantage. 

# 4) Action must be persistent and disciplined to be effective.

We’ve seen the importance of changing perspective, but on its own, it’s not enough – we also have to take action. However, in the face of the many obstacles that separate us from the good life, we need more than a single act – we need the strict discipline to act, and keep acting until the obstacle is overcome.

One person who proved that discipline wins out was Demosthenes – the greatest orator of ancient Athens.

On top of being cheated out of his inheritance by his guardians, Demosthenes was a sickly and frail person with a speech impediment. But when faced with all these obstacles he didn’t give up. Instead, he came up with a plan of action and stuck to it with incredible discipline. He locked himself in his study and taught himself law so he could take his former guardians to court. And to improve his speech, he would repeatedly recite oratory with his mouth full of pebbles!

Through his persistence, Demosthenes became not only the most famous orator in Athens, but also won his trial against his ex-guardians.

Just like Demosthenes, the inventor and entrepreneur Thomas Edison knew that effective action depends on our persistence.

In 1878, Edison went through 6,000 different types of material in order to discover the correct filament (a piece of bamboo) for the incandescent light bulb. Though there were other inventors also attempting to discover the incandescent bulb at the time, no other inventor went through so many different experiments to make sure they got it. It’s this persistence and tenacity that is universally recognized as the key to Edison’s great success. 

# 5) By identifying their weakness, we can learn how to turn obstacles against themselves.

Sometimes you will be faced with an obstacle so huge you’ll think you can’t overcome it. But often the largest obstacles hide the largest weaknesses.

For example, Gandhi’s civil disobedience – the non-violent movement known as *satyagraha* – and in particular, the Salt March, show how great power can be turned against itself.

Gandhi knew he couldn’t challenge Britain’s military rule in a direct conflict, so he decided to use non-violence and symbolic acts to show how unjust it was. His Salt March led hundreds of thousands of Indians to the ocean to collect salt in direct opposition to the British law that prohibited unregulated salt collection. And because it was a non-violent endeavor, it contested the British rule without lifting an arm in combat. The great strength of the empire was its monopoly of violence, and by challenging it non-violently, he was able to show how weak it actually was.

Another way to exploit an obstacle’s weakness is to use its strengths against it.

Alexander the Great did this when he tamed his horse, the wild Bucephalus. Until Alexander gentled him, Bucephalus would not allow anyone to ride him, and would fight off anyone who tried with furious anger. So Alexander made Bucephalus run in a straight line until the horse was exhausted, and gave up trying to resist. When Alexander then mounted him, the stallion let Alexander steer and control him. Alexander had used his strength in riding (his endurance) to tame Bucephalus by exploiting the horse’s obvious weakness (its constant anger used up its energy).

So by using its strengths against itself, even the strongest obstacle can be overcome. 

# 6) Our will enables us to accept what we cannot change, and change what we can.

Perception – the ability to see a situation objectively – and action (the practical skill of transforming the obstacle into our advantage) are, by themselves, not always enough. What really makes the difference is the last ingredient: our *will*. Unless we believe in ourselves and apply this internal power to all our actions, we will be unable to turn obstacles into advantages.

The will is what channels our perception and action into recognizing and changing what we can, and not worrying about things we cannot. This philosophy was developed by the Stoics in Ancient Athens and Rome, such as Epictetus, Seneca and Emperor Marcus Aurelius. They focused their will by always asking themselves what was in their control and what was not. They believed that we could not change external factors. These include natural events, other people’s actions, the inevitability of death, etc. They also believed, however, that we *could* change internal factors. These include our emotions, judgments, attitudes, responses and decisions.

Armed with this knowledge, we can then apply our will to change what we are able to change – i.e., our *internal* obstacles – while still facing and accepting the external obstacles we will inevitably encounter.

This principle is embodied in Thomas Edison’s reaction to a terrible blow to his career. In the early 1900s, when Edison was 67 years old, his research and production campus caught fire. When Edison arrived on the scene, the whole building – including all his prototypes, papers and research – had gone up in flames.

But Edison was unfazed, and saw this event as an opportunity to start over. He realized that he could not undo the fact of the fire, but could change his perspective, and approach a seemingly insurmountable obstacle as a way of starting over – getting “rid of a lot of rubbish,” he called it. And at the end of the year, Edison had turned a million dollar loss into a $10 million profit.",6 Things I learned from The Obstacle is The Way by Ryan Holiday,1613319685

My thoughts are laid out more in detail in the link, but a key issue I found in the book was that a) it didn't fully explain what it meant by polarisation in the first place (I note at least 3 different types of polarisation), b) there's limited discussion of international events which undermines the specific historical circumstance that only seems to affect the US, and c) there's little discussion of whether polarisation is a good thing or a bad thing - for instance gettingeveryone on one side of the criminal justice system reform argument would be good, getting everyone on multiple sides of abortion debate on the other hand?

books,"I just wrapped this book up earlier today and I have very mixed feelings. On one hand it some some of the most harrowing depictions of violence I’ve ever read, and on the other hand it can be dreadfully boring. 

My first problem with the book is that it can feel repetitive, especially during the middle section. The gang travels through landscapes on horseback, visit a town where they kill a few people, repeat. Another thing that irked me was a lot of the simple descriptions of events. It felt like the author was just trying to get through certain scenes as quickly as possible. One sentence you’re reading about them journeying through the desert and then in the next it’s like “by the way they massacred an entire town.” I think the author possibly did this on purpose to generate a sense of apathy towards the horrendous acts taking place in the book, and I’m just missing the point. 

One thing this book did really well was make me *hate* the main cast. Not because they were poorly written, they were all pretty great characters, but because of just how morally repugnant they were. They aren’t just outlaws. These men are fucking degenerates and the book lets you know that very early on. This is especially true when it comes to the Judge. Holy shit, talk about an absolute monster of a human being. Some of the stuff he does is so appalling that it’s almost comedic.

Without a doubt the best part of Blood Meridian is the philosophical bits.

Everyone knows Jordan Peterson is predisposed to long digressions and word-salad-like explanations of things- but good lord get to the point already.  I understand that he can't just give the rules one after the other and call it a book- it would be over in less than 20 pages.  However, some of these explanations to the rules are so superfluously verbose it just takes me right out of it.  I'm on Rule 7: Pursue What is Meaningful, not What is Expedient- and he's gone off on multiple tangents about Western Society, Christianity, Totalitarianism etc.  Admittedly, I like his explanations on suffering and the delay of gratification- as well as the accompanying accounts he gives with it.  However, if I wanted to hear about bible stories and Christ- I would just read the Bible!  It's clear as day that the underpinnings of Christianity and Abrahamic faith in general are interwoven throughout this book- but enough already.  

In previous chapters, I actually really enjoyed Jordan giving accounts from his actual clinical practice- even if they're just anecdotes.  If he took those experiences and coupled them with statistical peer-reviewed data to make his points, I think I would find this book much more interesting.  After all, he is a clinical psychologist- so why not include practical uses of this advice to show how good it is?  Admittedly, he did do this in previous chapters, but do more of it!

How do you feel about your alarm clock? Is it the despised, sleep-destroying herald of that hateful time of day, morning? Or, by the time it starts its beeping, are you already out of bed, going energetically about your gung-ho, sunrise-filled life?

To put the question more concisely: Why is morning a balm to some and a bane to others?

Well, it all depends on your built-in *body clock*.

Nestled deep in the folds of your brain is a primeval timepiece, an internal clock that ticks out your body’s personal *circadian rhythm* – a 24-hour cycle that, regardless of morning alarms and evening appointments, your body is naturally inclined to follow.

Your circadian rhythm dictates a great number of things. It’s what guides your body’s desire for sleep – or the opposite of sleep. It’s what makes you want food or drink at certain times. It’s even responsible, to an extent, for moodiness and emotional ups and downs, as well as your metabolic rate.

But here’s the thing: circadian rhythms vary from person to person – a fact that causes a large chunk of the population both to hate alarm clocks and to suffer from health complications.

This portion, which makes up about 30 percent of the population, consists of “night owls,” people whose circadian rhythm inclines them to seek slumber late at night and to rise late in the morning.

Distressingly for these nocturnal folks, society is morning-oriented. School and work typically begin in the morning and last through the afternoon, right when the body clocks of night owls say they should be asleep, or at least still sleepy.

Being out of sync with society’s schedule puts night owls in a tough position: they must get up early even though they fall asleep late. Thus, they’re often sleep-deprived, which makes it likelier that they’ll suffer from a range of illnesses, including diabetes, depression and cancer. 

# Sleep deprivation leads to high blood pressure and heart disease.

Diet, exercise and sleep: the author used to tell people that these three things were the pillars of good health. Now he goes one step further and says that sleep is the foundation on which all the other pillars stand.

This is especially the case for cardiovascular health.

In the West, cardiovascular disease, otherwise known as heart disease, is so prevalent that the cost of treating it is hamstringing the health-care budgets of multiple countries.

But the real cure couldn’t be cheaper. People simply need to sleep more.

Consider a 2011 study which looked at more than 500,000 people from eight different countries – men and women, young and old, and of varying ethnicities – and concluded that sleep deprivation increases a person’s risk of either getting or dying from cardiovascular disease by 45 percent.

Another study traced employed Japanese males over the course of 14 years and found that, when compared to workers who got more sleep, those who slept six hours or less per night were 500 percent more likely to suffer a cardiac arrest.

Even when one accounts for other factors that cause heart problems – such as smoking or obesity – the link between sleep deprivation and cardiovascular disease is strong.

So why does less sleep mean more heart problems? Well, it mainly has to do with blood pressure.

Whenever you don’t get enough sleep, the pressure in your veins goes up. Even losing one or two hours of rest will do the trick. It might take a while, but, eventually, these instances of increased pressure take their toll: the walls of your blood vessels become stretched and damaged.

Now, it’s common knowledge that high blood pressure is responsible for many deaths – seven million of them per year, to be exact – but not many people know that they could avoid a similar fate just by catching a few extra z’s. 

# Every animal needs sleep, but they don’t all need the same kind of sleep or the same amount of it.

Did you know that sharks never close their eyes? These killers of the deep literally get no shut-eye whatsoever. But that doesn’t mean that, as was long believed, they don’t sleep; they simply have no eyelids.

In fact, we have yet to discover an animal that doesn’t need sleep. And, although the need for sleep is universal, the amount needed varies wildly.

Elephants, for example, require roughly four hours of sleep per day. Big cats, on the other hand, such as lions and tigers, need more than three times that amount – about 15 hours! We humans, as you doubtless know, should sleep for about eight hours per day. And the world’s most accomplished sleeper, the brown bat, clocks so much sleep time that its waking day lasts only five hours.

Why do some animals need so much sleep and others so little? We have no idea.

Species’ snooze habits aren’t governed by size or diet. It doesn’t matter whether they’re nocturnal or diurnal. Even trying to generalize by order doesn’t work. For instance, squirrels and degus both belong to the animal order Rodentia – but degus need 7.7 hours of sleep, and squirrels need more than twice that.

As if these differences weren’t baffling enough, different animal species also engage in different kinds of sleep.

For example, research shows that only two classes of animals experience *rapid-eye-movement* (REM) sleep: mammals and birds. During the REM stage, the sleeping bird or mammal dreams, and to prevent its acting out those dreams, its entire body becomes paralyzed. But all other animal classes – reptiles, fish, insects and so on – never enter this stage of sleep. In short, your cat probably dreams, but your pet boa constrictor certainly doesn’t.

There’s one exception to this rule: it seems that whales and dolphins and other aquatic mammals don’t enter REM sleep, either. This is probably because were these animals to experience the attendant paralysis, they would drown. 

# Driving drowsy is equally as dangerous as driving drunk.

People do crazy things for fame, and a long list of these wild feats can be found in *The Guinness Book of World Records*. However, some categories that the book used to monitor either proved so dangerous or so reprehensible that they’re no longer recorded. One of those categories? Sleep deprivation.

Depriving yourself of sleep is certainly bad for you personally – but it can also make you a threat to society, especially if you regularly operate a motor vehicle.

All it takes is getting less than seven hours of sleep per night, and your chances of becoming involved in an accident increase appreciably.

But that’s not a whole lot of sleep loss, right? True. However, it’s enough to make your body try to catch up on rest by entering a *microsleep* – a bout of sleep that lasts only a handful of seconds.

A microsleep only differs from normal sleep in duration. So, during those moments of microsleep, you have no control of your motor functions, which means you’re no longer doing what you should do when behind the wheel: attending to the task of driving.

Even if your speed is relatively low – say, 30 miles per hour – it only takes two seconds for your car to drift into the next lane. So a two-second microsleep is more than sufficient to cause a major accident.

But sleeping while driving isn’t the only danger of sleep deprivation. In fact, driving while drowsy is as dangerous as driving while drunk.

Just consider this Australian study. Researchers split participants into two groups. The members of one group were given enough alcohol to make them legally drunk (so, until their blood-alcohol concentration barely exceeded 0.05). The members of the other group were deprived of sleep for a night.

The findings? Well, the sleep-deprived participants, after going without sleep for 19 hours, were given a concentration test – and they did as poorly on it as the drunk group.

Keep this in mind next time you’re out late. You may not have had a drop to drink, but driving drowsy is comparably irresponsible. 

# If you want to sleep better, get lots of sunlight and avoid certain substances.

Most of us don’t get eight hours’ sleep. Or, if we do, the sleep isn’t exactly high-quality. We toss and turn; we wake up in the middle of the night. Our minds are constantly on, thinking about unanswered emails, approaching deadlines and the constant chatter of social media.

Well, the author has some tips that’ll help us all get a nightly eight hours of deep, rejuvenating sleep.

First off, there are a couple of things you might want to consider avoiding – such as alcohol and nicotine.

Sure, a nightcap feels relaxing, and it might help your waking self unwind, but alcohol also makes it harder for your body to enter deep sleep. And large quantities of alcohol can impair your breathing when you’re asleep. Furthermore, people usually wake up when the alcohol wears off, which sort of defeats the purpose of all that pre-sleep relaxation.

Nicotine will also tamper with your slumbers. Smoking may feel as relaxing as drinking, but nicotine is, unlike alcohol, a stimulant. Thus, smokers tend to sleep lightly – and, because of morning nicotine withdrawal, they often wake up earlier than they’d like.

In addition to avoiding these substances, you can also introduce a few sleep-promoting routines into your day and evening.

For example, before going to bed, take a hot bath. The bath itself will relax your body and mind – and, of equal importance, the drop in body temperature that results from your exiting the bath will induce a feeling of drowsiness.

You should also try to get a good amount of natural sunlight during the day. This will help your body regulate your sleep pattern. Another trick is to open your bedroom curtains before you hop into bed, so that the sun, and not an alarm, is what rouses you in the morning. Finally, keep the temperature in your bedroom relatively low.
