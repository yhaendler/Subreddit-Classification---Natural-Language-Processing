datascience,"Hi everyone, 

So I am data-scientist and recently gotten promotion for the work that I have been doing. I work in chemical industry and have developed a completely automated machine learning pipeline for certain applications. The promotion also means to scale up. With great automation comes great computation we found out. We have tested and document our code to the extend that we can be sure that ""it works"" and that we understand what we are doing. The next step would be a full role-out on 10.000s of cases. The stack works on python and is ready for distributed computing through joblib and dask. I am curious what the feasibility of Raspberry Pi clusters are for such large computations. The incremental growth that is possible through low-cost SBCs seems to be extremely attractive. Are the compatibility issues to be considered? The 90% is Scikit learn and Image, which are native libraries as far as I know. Does anyone have experience with Dask, Raspberry Pi and Machine Learning Pipelines on a large scale? Does it make sense to go down this route?

datascience,"Hey all! I’m sure I can already guess the answer to this one, but I feel like it’s still worth asking:

I’m currently planning on majoring in Economics but have a interest in applying that field to data science. The school I attend, UVA, has just created a new stats minor for fall 2020, called Data Analytics, which is basically just a minor in said subject. 

However, I know that data science and machine learning involve a lot of probability; given my schedule, I could major in statistics and gain probability knowledge, although such courses are difficult and could raise a lot of hell for me with my concurrent Econ courses. If I minor, however, I could graduate by next year and maybe look into my schools MS in Commerce or MS in data science programs (note: I’m not necessarily looking for a career in machine learning... I’m more geared towards say, business data analytics).

That being said, would it be recommended that I simply tough it out, and double major? Or would a minor in this new stats course also suffice?

datascience,"Hello all, I've really enjoyed solving the problems on https://projecteuler.net/ recently for personal pleasure and to learn more about mathematics/algorithms. 

For those unfamiliar with Project Euler it has many different mathematical problems many of which are unsolvable by brute force with a programming language. It forces you to think about things in the most efficient way possible and find solutions which are not obvious at first. After you solve the problem you can view a forum thread for that specific problem in which other people post their code for their solutions. It's a lot of fun seeing how your algorithm compares to others and learning ways which your algorithm can be improved. 

I was just wondering if something similar to this exists for machine learning specifically? I'm hoping to try out some different machine learning models in a non-competitive relaxed environment and also have ability to see how others solved the same problem.

datascience,"I'm currently interviewing for an entry-level business analyst job in Institutional Research at a college. I'd be transitioning careers from educational admin. to IR. I'm self taught in stats, R, and assessment, so this would be a dream job for me. I had to complete a skills assessment activity for them, in which I was to analyze the data in any way I wanted and then write an executive summary. The dataset was for 30,000 students, and included demographic info, information on financial aid, and then ""retained"" and ""graduated"" columns, coded 0=not retained/not graduated, 1=retained/graduated.

I did the following, all using R:

-Cleaned data and transformed it, coding certain categorical variables to numeric.

-Calculated average federal loan/Pell amounts for the student body and compared these amounts to institutions of similar size/demographic makeup.

-Calculated retention rates for full- and part-time students (a surprising 98% for both), and compared these to the same benchmark institutions.

-Created visualizations to show the distribution of financial aid amount across races using boxplots.

-Conducted a logistic regression analysis to study the predictive effect of financial aid amount on retention (again coded as 0,1). I provided the summary() output in a ""figures"" section of the summary.

Now that I've submitted everything, I'm overthinking and panicking that maybe I didn't do enough. What do you guys think? Are these analyses sufficient for something like this? I'm pretty sure using R in itself is overkill (they said they mostly use Excel, but that if I'm comfortable with R I should use that).

datascience,"I am particularly interested in the third-course, Machine Learning Fundamentals. Does this class have as much math as the previous course, Probability and Statistics in Data Science using Python, which I am nearly finished with?  




I have enjoyed the Probability and Statistics course. However, the advertised Effort: 10–12 hours per week, has been a considerable underestimation due to my need to refresh my calculus skills, it’s been 20 years! I have done quite well in the course and am confident it will translate to an A. With that said, I won’t have the same time to dedicate Machine Learning Fundamentals this spring, if it requires as much catching up on the side. I am not worried about the programming. I volunteer as a coding club teacher (python/data science course) for middle and high school students, which includes projects using SciKit Learn, Karas, and Tensor Flow.

datascience,"In *Elements of Statistical Learning*, the authors write

&gt;What value should we choose for K? With K = N [LOOCV], the cross-validation estimator is approximately unbiased for the true (expected) prediction er- ror, but can have high variance because the N “training sets” are so similar to one another. The computational burden is also considerable, requiring N applications of the learning method.

Computational burden is becoming less and less of an obstacle, which leaves variability as a reason not to perform LOOCV.  I've realized that ESL doesn't provide any references for this claim, and I'm ashamed to say I've just accepted it by virtue of having names like Hastie and Tibshirani on the cover.  There aren't even any simulations to substantiate the claim!

A colleague and I had a disagreement on CV scheme, which lead to me being shown [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/61783/bias-and-variance-in-leave-one-out-vs-k-fold-cross-validation/252031#252031) thread on Cross Validated. Seems like (at least from the simulations provided) that LOOCV can be provide unbiased estimates with comparable variability, flying in the face of ESL.

datascience,"I am trying to forecast time series of product sales, I started approaching the problem by implementing the ARIMA model, I iterated over all the possibilities of the models parameters (p, d, q) and picked the one with least RMSE, problem is the forecast is not as good as I wanted it to be, so I started studying other ways of prediction, like regression.

After plotting my data in a cumulative plot, I noticed that most of the time series I had are fairly linear, so probably I can fit a linear regression model on them.

What should I use in my case, ARIMA model or linear regression, and what does ARIMA model has to offer than regression does not, for it to compensate for being more complicated.
