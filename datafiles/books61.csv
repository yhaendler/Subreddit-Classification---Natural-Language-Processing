I'm team Kindle and LOVE the ease of downloading books from my local library through Overdrive. During the pandemic, I've noticed more and more of the books I'm requesting having longer wait lines. I put in a request yesterday for which my hold position is #1686 (there are 299 copies of the book, so the wait shouldn't be *too* bad). It's great to see the resurgence in appreciation for books, but I'm also hyper-aware of how much support authors and local bookstores need during this pandemic and hope that they are being compensated. 

My question is, is there some type of e-book subscription service that any of you know of or have used that supports local bookstores? With this resurgence of book appreciation, it would be awesome to be able to shell out a little money to contribute to the success of local bookstores and authors, especially if it means getting quicker access to ebooks.

books,"As part of my reading in preparation for uni next year and out of a general interest in reading, I've begun accumulating a lot of books. They're all non fiction, cover a breadth of subjects have mostly red or black spines (which can make it hard to immediately find something). Until now, I haven't stuck to any real organisational system beyond keeping writers' works together. However, as I've acquired more books, I've started questioning whether there are other ways of organising them that look both nicer and are better for quickly finding things again to refer to.

books,"When a book that's been on your to-read list *forever* becomes available, remember that there's probably a reason you hadn't got around to it yet.

On the flip side, sometimes it will be better than you ever would have guessed and you'll be mad you didn't read it sooner. 

When you've read an author's most famous works then go back to their debut, you kind of have to ask why they didn't purge its existence from the face of the earth once they got famous - and good!

Audible's ""one credit a month"" system will *never* work for me and I just don't understand who it's for because if I'm enjoying an audiobook I'll listen to it every spare waking moment and use up that credit in a week.

Despite my groaning shelves and toppling stacks, my default state is ""I really like this, I should buy the paperback"" because I want my house to collapse apparently.

That's a lot of smut!

When it's an author you've never heard of but the cover is really pretty, it will probably be tripe.

When it's an author you've never heard of, the cover is ugly, but the blurb cites unsourced public adoration, it's going to be a weird book and when you look it up on Goodreads there will only be 39 reviews from other people who were tricked like you.

It's a lot easier to DNF when it didn't cost anything.

I still hate Amazon and resent the burden this free subscription put on me.

What first caught my interest was Dodie Smith's (of 101 dalmations fame) first novel, ""I Capture the Castle"", and I soon followed this girlish, romantic, coming of age story from the 30's back to it's quoted inspiration Jane Eyre and from there ""sideways"", if you will, to Little Women. These novels I have enjoyed for their romanticism and sentimentality (I'm not saying Jane Eyre is a ""sentimental novel"", please don't shout at me), girlish outlook and character-focused storylines.

However, this has previously been unusual for me.

Sci-fi classics like ""The Forever War"", or Ursula le Guin's ""The Left Hand of Darkness"" are some of my favourites, along with some Phillip K. Dick stuff.

books,"What makes us human? That is the main question that P. K. Dick asks us, readers, in his most famous novel.

This was the question that I wanted to answer while reading this book, yet the question still remains. Not because I didn't read properly, but because I want to use this question to the psychology of everyone I meet through my life. Let's explain my concept after reading this amazing book and let's analyze the message behind it.


The story takes place after World War Terminus. It was a devastating war that made humans colonize Mars. To everyone who colonize Mars, an android was gifted. These androids did most chores and some more difficult tasks. Some of the androids became deviant (replicant as in a movie Blade Runner), and escaped Mars, killing some humans in process. Those who wished not to colonize Mars remained on Earth (one more reason for not colonizing to Mars is low IQ). Because most humans left Earth, people that remained got lonely and depressed. That is why they bought themselves animals, and if there weren't any alive animals they bought electric animals.

The story follows Rick Deckard, who is somewhat of a bounty hunter. Bounty hunters who hunt replicants are called blade runners (really cool name you got to admit it). Dave Holden is another bounty hunter. He was on a mission to ""retire"" 8 Nexus-6 replicants who left Mars. He killed 2 of them, but the sixth one, Polokov, shot him. Dave didn't die, but he was badly hurt. 

Rick gets Dave's task, and so the story of the question of empathy begins. 


First of all, that is where I will stop with the story of the book because I want others to read it too. And second of all, I just wanted to say that this story really got me thinking. 

The part that is most interesting about the book (in my opinion), is where Rick starts to question his own humanity. He starts to feel sorry for the androids that he retires. At one point, he does Voight-Kampff test to see if he emphatizes with the androids deaths. He does.

He wants to retire from the job, but at the end he doesn't. 

My thoughts on this, I really read this without taking any notes, so this whole review is really bad. But I really do feel like I got the message out of this. We humans, tend to feel an emotion of empathy. As we see someone or something suffer, we start to feel that feeling. That is one thing that separates androids from us, they don't care about other androids and will basically report any strange activity coming from another android without felling empathy for them. That is what srparates us, humans, from machines. It is our strongest feeling in the battle against the machine. It makes us human.",My thought on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?

* What message do you think Howard's tale was trying to convey?

* Do you understand why Abe and Dan went about dismissing Howard's tale?

&gt; I could not conceive of any way in which accompanying  Marie to wherever she had in mind could be a good idea.

* Why do you think Abe responded to seeing Marie the way he did? Why did he follow her even though he knew it wasn't a good idea?

* To refer back to the first question, what message do think the book was trying to convey?

* What did you think of Langan's writing style and what was your favorite part of the book?

books,"Hi all,

I wanted to share a new discovery I had with you. But first: are you tired of struggling to read annoying verbose prose? Are you tired of being shamed for not finishing enough books? Do audiobooks slow you down in achieving your reading goals by having narrators that are SO slow?

Well, then you're like me...and guess what, I figured out a solution. **I read books via Youtube video summaries!** It's great. I recently began listening to channels that summarize the plot so I don't have to deal with the annoying useless descriptions authors use. I've finished over 250 books this year and I'm so proud of myself! My favorite is the video on One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. It was just such a sad plot. I feel like I even understood the themes better than my friends who read it in book format. It's kind of annoying that they tell me it doesn't count but I think they're envious because I retained more information than they did. 

So yeah, if you want to finish more books this year, consider dropping audiobooks and read it via Youtube like me. Surprised no one thought of this before lol, but feel free to thank me if it works for you. Happy readings everyone!",Forget audiobooks; I've just discovered an even better way to read!,1603984828

books,"I want to talk about one of my favourite series, the diaries of Adrian Mole. It's relatively obscure, but better known over here in Britain.

It is a series of 8 books that have the diary format. They follow a boy called Adrian Mole, a self-centred and egotistical teenage boy who thinks of himself as an intellectual. Whether he is unlikeable or not, the first two books are hilarious and really give an insight into what the life of a teenage boy in 80s Britain was like. The rest of the books follow him trying to get to grips with adult life, which is incredibly humorous in their own right.

I'd definitely reccommend them to fans of that genre.",The secret diaries of Adrian Mole,1603983718

DISCLAIMER!!!!!! PLEASE READ!!!!

I was (am?) a big Sarah J Maas fan. Literally it was one of my favorite books series for like forever. This is not me trying to troll or something it’s honestly something that’s been weighing on my mind as a black person if I should keep supporting her and buying her books if she’s not actually for us. I came here looking for honest opinions!!!!

I feel like people will automatically say no but hear me out first. There are different levels of racism. I feel like Sarah would be considered a passive racist. Like she doesn’t really get what little things she does that’s racist or chooses to ignore it. And only does something about it when it’ll win her brownie points. But the end of the day I don’t think she really cares about diversity or her nonwhite readers as much as the white ones. Like I feel like she’s a fake woke liberal and is just doing a like of performative activism like a lot of people (not everyone). I hope I’m making sense. I can already see myself being downvoted to hell since Reddit is very white. Does anybody else think she may be racist? I really hope I also get some views from other black people.",Is Sarah J Maas a racist?,1603982859
books,"I am not particularly far into this book, but I am really enjoying the journey so far. However, I have a question that I need clearing up. Spoilers for part 1. 

Sal has just arrived in Denver and has been picked up by Chad. I am slightly confused though, as isn't Chad a friend from home? Or am I misremembering that? There is a LOT of names so far in this book, which I often find confusing. I know that, obviously, Dean came back to Denver, and I believe Carlo followed after, so did the rest of Sal's friends go to Denver too? Is this Sal's first time in Denver? 

I feel really silly asking these these questions, as I should be able to remember these details, considering I'm less than 50 pages in, but I'm struggling to follow! If anyone can help, that would be greatly appreciated.","Question about Jack Kerouac's ""On The Road""",1603982075

I posted a thread here last year when I finished my reading challenge and it sparked some good discussion, hopefully this one will too. The collage in the photos above was snipped from my Goodreads display of my books from this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year my goal was 38 books, and I ended up reading around 45. I spent a large portion of the year in a shitty living situation that led to me sitting in my room reading a lot for half the year, I assumed I wouldn't be able to read this much this year but the COVID lockdown came along to prove me wrong. I chose 42 book as this year's goal due to it being higher than last year, and also because it would give me the perfect opportunity to re-read The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  


My favourites from this year were:

* 2001: A Space Odyssey - Arthur C Clarke
* Love Lives Here - Amanda Jette Knox
* The Starless Sea - Erin Morgenstern
* The Testaments - Margaret Atwood
* The Alice Network - Kate Quinn
* This is How You Lose the Time War - Amal El-Mohtar &amp; Max Gladstone
* The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy - Douglas Adams

&amp;#x200B;

The books I didn't enjoy were:

* Beloved - Toni Morrison
* The Tattooist of Auschwitz - Heather Morris
* Tarnished City - Vic James
* This Body's Not Big Enough for Both of Us - Edgar Cantero

&amp;#x200B;

This year I made myself a reading list at the beginning of the year to decide what I wanted to read, and I think that helped keep me on track since choosing my next book was easier. I also tried to read more books by women and other marginalized identities to broaden my horizons a little more.

&amp;#x200B;

Happy to hear opinions on any of the books I've read this year, and also how people are getting on with their own reading goals for 2020.","Finished my 2020 Reading Challenge early, a rundown of what I did and didn't enjoy",1603979537

any time i see ""books that changed your life"" threads, the comments always read like a highschool mandatory reading list. these books, while great, are read at a time when people are still very emotional, impressionable, and malleable. i want to know what books changed you, rocked you, or devastated you as an adult; at a time when you'd had a good number of years to have yourself and the world around you figured out.
