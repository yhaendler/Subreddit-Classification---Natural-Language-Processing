Well, in the first place the way of describing lanndscapes was something amazing for me, something that in the past I would have found so boring it seemed wonderful to me, in second place, the development of the main character, Buck is incredible, even when it is a dog.

books,"While there are many well-known epigraphs, ""You are all a lost generation"" (Gertrude Stein) from The Sun Also Rises, or ""Lawyers, I suppose, were children once."" (Charles Lamb) from To Kill a Mockingbird, one of the great joys of my reading experience were the 50+(!) perfect epigraphs in Richard Adams's Watership Down.  Fiction, non-fiction, poetry, prose, Adams's carefully curated epigraphs illuminate, educate, and elevate an already great tale.  Cited poets and novelists include **Aeschylus, Browning, Renault, Malory, Tennyson, Yeats, Thomas, Hardy, Austen, Carroll, Dostoevsky, de la Mare, and Shakespeare**. **Clausewitz, Napoleon** and **Wellington** front chapters, as do **Gilgamesh, Joseph Campbell**, and the librettist of Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte, **Lorenzo da Ponte.  R.M. Lockley,** author of The Private Life of The Rabbit, informatively leads multiple chapters.  

My favorite (it is hard to choose) is the excerpt from **Robinson Jeffers's** poem *Hurt Hawks*, which begins chapter 23, Kehaar:

&gt;The wing trails like a banner in defeat,  
&gt;  
&gt;No more to use the sky for ever but live with famine and pain a few days.  
&gt;  
&gt;He is strong and pain is worse to the strong  
&gt;  
&gt;incapacity is worse  
&gt;  
&gt;No one but death the redeemer will humble that head,  
&gt;  
&gt;The intrepid readiness, the terrible eyes.

I won't include spoilers in this post, but the poem is an impeccably fitting introduction to the chapter and character - one almost wonders if Adams started with a scrapbook full of quotations around which to frame his story.  

The cumulative effect of these tasty quotes and excerpts is to enhance an already masterful act of storytelling.  If an epigraph can be seen as a form of miniature storytelling in itself, foreshadowing what is to come, they add yet another wonderful layer to Watership, combining with the embedded stories of El-ahrairah and the story proper.  Watership is brilliant on so many levels, but Adams's masterful use of epigraphs adds even more enjoyment for the reader - and even leading them on to new writers and works to explore.",Watership Down and the Art of the Epigraph,1589496720

books,"Rewatching the Ken Burns documentary ""The Vietnam War"" while also reading Karl Marlantes' Matterhorn makes for a rather immersive sense of what living through that time period must have felt like. Frustrating, fearful, and uncertain. At 600 pages I was a little nervous to jump in but I have finished the book over the past 3 days with enthusiasm. The invented true to life story wraps you around the men of Bravo company in North Western Vietnam as they stalk through the jungle. At one point, our main character emotionally describes the experience of the daily reality he was faced with. Marlantes' ability to convey powerful imagery struck me as I read the following passage:

""Remember that feeling you got picking blackberries?"" He asked.  ""You know, with friends, and maybe somebody's Grandmother who's come along and she's going to make pie when you get home, and the air's so warm it's like Mother Nature is baking bread?""

She nodded, smiling. ""I remember.""

""There used to be a great patch,""... ""near the garbage dump of this little logging town where I grew up.""... ""It's like a car suddenly roars down on you with six beefy guys in it. You stand there next to this old kind woman with your berry bucket in your hand and you're suddenly a little scared. All the guys have been drinking. Their faces are covered with masks. They have rifles. One takes the berry buckets and throws them down on the side of the road. They shove you around. Then they take you to the dump, laughing a little, as if they're expecting some fun. You're instructed that you're all going to play a game. Here's the rules.""... ""The men, that is the boys, have to crawl through the dump from one end to the other. Whenever we come across a can whose lid we cannot see, we must pick it up and show it to the men with the rifles. If the can turns out to be empty, we can continue. If it turns up unopened, then we get killed. We get down in the garbage. The dump always has a fire smoldering. The smoke makes you puke and cough. The old grandma's job consists of bringing water to any of us who come up with a pleasing or clever way of revealing a can. We even get ribbons if we're particularly clever. Of course, if we refuse to pick up any cans, then we have to stay crawling in the garbage forever, or at least until the strange men get tired of their fucking game.""...

books,"I keep seeing discourse about all the protesters buying ice cream with assault rifles and rocket launchers but refusing to wear masks. Insisting on doing something showy but unhelpful while not doing the very easy thing that will actually accomplish their goal. I was reminded of this passage from Steppenwolf how everyone is so deluded about how their life should be like a movie and is disappointed when it isn't:

“You have a picture of life within you, a faith, a challenge, and you were ready for deeds and sufferings and sacrifices, and then you became aware by degrees that the world asked no deeds and no sacrifices of you whatever, and that life is no poem of heroism with heroic parts to play and so on, but a comfortable room where people are quite content with eating and drinking, coffee and knitting, cards and wireless. And whoever wants more and has got it in him--the heroic and the beautiful, and the reverence for the great poets or for the saints--is a fool and a Don Quixote.""

They all want to play the hero, not realizing all it takes to be the hero is to simply wear a mask. This also brings to mind Hesse's introduction to the novel which essentially says 'I wrote this as a sad old man, you are young and you are not the steppenwolf, go outside and stop wallowing in misery.' I don't have a hard copy of the book to know when this introduction was written, but I wonder how Hesse would introduce the book to today's reader.",Thoughts on stay at home protesters from Steppenwolf,1589494852

books,"I just finished reading A Little Life and it was the first book to ever make me cry. I flipped through the last 100 or so pages with tears in my eyes. It’s definitely the best book I’ve read so far this year &amp; will remain one of my favourites.

I was moved by many different aspects of this story. While Jude’s life does not mirror mine at all, he’s become one of my favourite characters. So many times while reading, I just wanted to reach out and give Jude a hug, just wrap my arms around him in an embrace and tell him it was okay. 

After Willem’s death, the part where Jude tries to compensate for Willem’s absence by indulging himself in Willem’s scent lingering in clothes he left behind, or the sound of his voice from voice messages, was the one that shattered my heart the most. Especially the part where Jude sprays Willem’s shirt with the sandalwood cologne, but then realizes it was Willem’s very selfless that made Willem smell like Willem - this part made the book so personal for me because I have also, in the past, tried to remember someone I loved by their smell, by spraying their cologne on me when I lost them. 

I had really hoped Hanya Yanagihara wouldn’t take away Willem from Jude because after all that he went through, he deserved to have that one person he so dearly loved and could open up to but oh well... after Willem was killed off I instantly knew Jude was going to kill himself because some losses are in fact greater than life itself...

I just really, absolutely loved this book &amp; it’ll take me a while before I move on from this one... yes, the book can at certain points feel overwritten and melodramatic and disturbing, but quiet honestly, this story has moved me in ways I never expected to be moved. I felt real emotions through the words, I felt the cuts &amp; bruises...

books," Hey everyone, I'm an 18-year-old student who never liked reading, let it be books or articles. Moreover, since my childhood, I have always preferred visuals such as animation, movies rather than books. However, when I started to think about myself, about how could I improve myself, I came across this book named ""The magic of thinking big"" by David Schwartz. At first, I was quite excited to know what the author tells on improving oneself as its a self-improvement book; after reading for somedays and getting the main idea, I stopped reading it because I couldn't push myself to complete the book as I wasn't a person who loves reading. But there were some stories that were depicted by the author and I could relate to it so well. That made me stick to the book and after long 3 months, I finally finished reading the book. It was the first non-textual book that I completed reading. And after that, an unusual thirst started to arise inside me and it was for more self-improvement books like that.  I started to browse all those non-fiction books, and from then I can proudly say that I'm now a person who loves reading. From books to articles, I try to spend at least 60 minutes on reading daily.

books,"Looking for a good stand-alone fantasy book, I came across this one (by Naomi Novik), with great ratings. However, the top-rated reviews were one star ratings - so I became a bit wary of spending money on something that, perhaps, was overhyped.

As fate would have it, Amazon ended up giving me a copy of the e-book for free. By the time I was 10% done, I was already confused by the seething reviews at the top of the page.

Having finished it, I think that this an example of something that is far too common in the internet today: having to overly criticize something that's super praised, but didn't click with you. I totally get it: everyone loves this thing, you read it, and come out with a very ""meh"" feeling, making you feel like you totally missed the point somehow.

But giving it the lowest rating possible (some complaining that they wish they could give ZERO stars) is... a peculiar reaction. Even when I left a highly praised piece of media completely underwhelmed, I'd never lambast it like some of those reviews did.

Most of the complaints of these less-than-flattering reviews are very strange to me: the magic system is clearly a soft system, meant to evoke wonder and mystery, not to be something that's explained; the Dragon has a reason to be an asshole (which is talked about very late into the story); complaining that the Dragon doesn't do anything terrible with the girls is particularly weird, since that's explained in the first page or two - not a mystery that takes up half the story, only to have an underwhelming solution.

No no, the bulk of the story here is the struggle against The Woods. A seemingly sentient source of pure evil, which only wishes to spread as much as possible. The sections of the book describing the vileness of The Wood were by far my favorite part. The idea of a... force of nature, that just wants to spread horror is very compelling to me. Granted, this isn't a horror novel, it's a fairy tale. So it's not quite as disturbing and unsettling as I'm selling here perhaps.

And to call the protagonist a Mary Sue isn't accurate to me. She's just one girl with the gift of magic - one that came after many others before her. Her approach to magic goes back to that sense of wonder and mystery that the magic system here wants to portray: she's not ""special"", she's just learning things on her own way, which just works. That's kinda how the book describes her methods: it just works. Again, it's a soft magic system.

I like to say that we live in an Age of Cynicism of sorts - people only know to criticize things using hyperbolic statements apparently. Go on Youtube, and search for ""the problem with"", you'll see countless of examples of that. So The Last Jedi isn't a flawed, problematic film, it's a ""complete cinematic failure"". Uprooted wasn't an underwhelming, ""meh"" book for these people, it was one of (if not *the*) worst novels they ever read, worthy of the lowest rating possible.

That being said, I tend to agree with the criticism about the romance. I wasn't as offended as the most passionate detractors (there's *some* sort of magical reasoning going on there), and I can see what were the author's intentions with the relationship, but I personally think it'd work just as effectively if it was just a strong friendship, without having to turn romantic. Given the context of both characters, I wouldn't say it's nonsensical, but I thought it was a bit superfluous.

The novel also lost a bit of momentum there. Around the time we got introduced to the capital, it was a bit of a slog to go through the pages, but it thankfully wasn't very long, and I was back to the actual story in no time.

I really enjoyed my time reading this one, and will check out the author's other works eventually.

My strongest feeling after finishing the book is dissatisfaction with how ungrateful Rosie is the whole journey. She’s doing PHD in psychology, she should know better about Aspergers symptoms or at least symptoms of socially incapable people. She knows Don is “weird”. It is unreasonable to expect him to perform as socially capable as normal people in a relationship. All he need is patience and guidance. 

But this lady act like she doesn’t understand why Don is not more expressive about his romantic feeling for her, leading to her feeling upset and resulting in dramatic exit of friendship with Don. Even after all the things he’s done for her DNA testing. The signs are obvious, he is apparently trying very hard, only lacking understanding of how relationships work which is something she could guide him on. 

Rosie is so self centred, all she cares is who her new daddy or will Don fuck her or not. I dislike her character. I like Don though.

I also find how everyone is either doctor or psychologist amusing - in a boring way. Everyone is successful/ economically stable/ highly educated in this book and has almost perfect life, with a slight bump maybe. So I can’t relate well to the story. It’s not believable to me.

Apparently he would get irritated by those that believe that a home library should be a collection of books that one has either already read or else plans on reading soon. Instead, a proper home library should consist primarily of unread books, making it a valuable research tool. 

“The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allows you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of unread books.”

Like it's too, idk, ""old"" for me?  But I want to love it. I'm currently on page 79 and it's not bad. Most of the people I know who love it are adults in their 40s/50s and older. My mom adored it and it's her favorite King book. I heard that there's a certain point in the late beginning when the story really starts kicking off. Idk if I'm at that point yet. Just want to know if there's anyone who loves this book who's under, say, 30 or 35?",Any young fans of 11/22/63?,1589471432

books,"So I am as busy as ever during quarantine unfortunately. I have a job and I’m also a student so I will lay out my schedule here :

Saturday &amp; Sunday : Work, 6am-2pm.
Monday &amp; Friday : Work, 2pm-10pm.
Tuesday I generally dedicate to schoolwork but I start early and am usually free after 5pm until usually about 7:30pm.

My goal is to read at least a half an hour daily, but probably an hour on Tuesday and Wednesday each. 

(Those 2 days are the only 2 that I’m actually holding myself accountable for, the other 5 days are just a read if you feel like it.)

I’m mostly reading YA lately, so here is my TBR :

1. The Forgetting by Sharon Cameron. Fantasy. (I’m on page 151 as of now.)
2. The Knowing by Sharon Cameron. (The sequel)
3. Follow Me Back by A.V. Geiger. Thriller/mystery.
4. Tell Me No Lies by A.V. Geiger. (The sequel.)
5. Interference by Kay Honeyman. A fluffy romance I threw in there to take a break from all the murder haha
6. The Girl I Used To Be by April Henry. Thriller/mystery.
7. The Night She Disappeared by April Henry. Thriller/mystery.
8. Murdered At 17 by Christine Conradt. Suspenseful/kinda romantic thriller.
9. Cold Day In The Sun by Sara Biren. Another fluffy romance I just threw in there.
10. For Better And Worse by Margot Hunt. Thriller/mystery. I think this is the only adult book I have on here currently. It’s got a very interesting concept and I’m very excited to read it.

So I guess just let me know if you’re interested in any of these books and we can read it together.",Looking for a reading buddy to hold me accountable while reading,1589469989

I read books 1&amp;2 when they came out (somewhere I have them both as illustrated editions) and used my time stuck at home to reread the first 2 and finally consume the 3rd. 

As I reached the end of Absolute Midnight, though, I was panicking. Pixler is still a seething Requiax. Finnegan is still in Boa's demonic workshop and we haven't seen it. Daddy Q is still wreaking magical havoc in Chickentown. Only a few pages left, what the hell?

books,"I’ve always enjoyed King, but have been a bit out of reading for a while now. Assigned reading for school sort of burned me out. And then I picked up The Outsider as a beach read early this year, and reignited my love of reading and King in particular. I’d had Night Shift on my shelf for a while and hadn’t touched it, so after finishing The Institute I cracked into it. I have had so much fun reading the stories, even if some of them are a bit kooky. I really do think short stories are his strong suit. I have thoughts about most, if not all of the stories, so I’d love to discuss with anyone else who’s read it!

Best stories:

-*Jerusalem's Lot*: I love this one. What a great kickoff to the book. I found the style of it so interesting, the choice to write in journal entry and letter form rather than just traditional story format. I have Salem's Lot to read next, so I’m excited to continue the story of Jerusalem's Lot. 

-*Night Surf*: I know this was a precursor to The Stand, and I know The Stand is a hot topic with the pandemic going on right now. This one was just as interesting because of current events. I didn’t like the protagonist much, I thought he was unpleasant, and I don’t know if it would have stood out to me as much without everything going on right now, but some of it felt eerily familiar and so I really liked it. 

-*The Boogeyman*: again, one with an unlikeable protagonist, and I thought it was really compelling in this story. Billings is a terrible father, but I liked how it subverted the idea of the parent who’d do anything to save their child... instead, Billings, being as selfish as he is, puts himself above the child he claims to have loved unlike his first two. The ending was one of the better ones, I knew the closet being ajar in the therapist's office would be relevant but didn’t expect it to happen as it did. 

-*Battleground*: this one was so fun. The idea of the toys come to life and waging all out war against Renshaw, I loved it. I think this story painted some of the most vivid imagery in my mind. And that ending... where you think he’s about to get the better of them, and then he fails in the homestretch. 

-*Trucks*: again, one of those situational things. I read this one while on the interstate, in a truck, after leaving a truck stop, so it was easy to imagine the setting. One of the most bleak stories in the book, but for some reason the idea of vehicles gaining self-awareness had me side-eyeing the semis at every rest stop after finishing this. 

-*Sometimes They Come Back*: I thought this was one of the most compelling stories in the book. The ending fell a bit flat for me, with the demon exorcism thing in the classroom. But I enjoyed up until that. Realizing what was going on with the boys coming back to haunt Jim. Again, one of those stories that seems made for a movie, and I know there was one— but I think I’ll hold off on it, since it seems to have less than stellar reviews. 

-*The Ledge*: left me so uncomfortable, not quite knowing if Norris would make it. I was genuine squirming so much with how much description King put into the imagery going on.. I could imagine it, and I didn’t like it. Still, Cressner was such an interesting antagonist that I had to know how it ended. 

-*Quitter's Inc.*: this one was possibly one of the top stories in the book, in my opinion. I enjoyed following as Morrison became more and more indoctrinated. The ending, where he sends someone else to them in the same way his old friend sent him, was very satisfying, seeing the vicious cycle continue. 

-*I Know What You Need*: my other top story. Ed was such an interesting antagonist; he’s not outright bad, but there’s just something off about him, just enough to make you distrust him and root for the roommate who tries to convince Liz that he’s not right. I love a sympathetic villain, so I really liked how he had some qualities that made you feel a bit sorry for him, with his poor upbringing and social isolation.

## Briefly about the methodology

Wikipedia currently has over 53 million articles in over 300  languages. Despite the impressive number of articles, not all topics can  be written in this free encyclopedia. At the same time, the community  of each language version has the ability to decide which topic can be  described in the encyclopedia, and which is not (for example, article  must be [notable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability)).  In addition, each language version can describe the same topic in its  own way - it all depends on the quantity and quality of the authors  (Wikipedia users who edit articles).

Almost every Wikipedia article has an aligment to certain categories.  Additionally, based on the content, you can specify the subject of the  article - for this you can, for example, use semantic relations in [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) or [DBpedia](https://wiki.dbpedia.org/). More details on the automatic article classification process can be found in various scientific works (e.g. for [articles](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/8/3/60) or [sources](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/5/263)).

This article selected the most-developed language versions of  Wikipedia with over 1 million articles, including English, German,  French, Spanish, Russian, Polish and other. After the classification of  articles, only those that are dedicated to individual books. As a result  for English Wikipedia 56591 articles about books were found, French -  24199 books, Italian - 15796 books, German - 13190 books, Spanish -  11783 books, Russian - 8126 books, Portuguese - 7189 books, Polish -  6925 books, Arabic - 6617 books, Japanese - 6099 books and Chinese -  5095 books.

As mentioned earlier, every Wikipedia article can have different  language versions, so we can find out different names of the same object  (book). Using [open data on Wikipedia article views](https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews/)  we can find out how many times a given article has been viewed on  specific days. After collecting data for viewing all Wikipedia articles  on books in the appropriate language versions April 2020 ranking of the  most readable was made. First, the positions of books in the ranking are  shown, which were obtained by adding up the page views from different  language versions for a given book. Later, the most popular books are  shown for only one language version of Wikipedia.

Recently we [observed](https://blog.wikirank.net/2020/wikirank-upgrade-fair-popularity-and-new-features/)  that visitors number for some articles was “overclocked” in some  periods of time. Therefore, we decide to provide additional modification  of the pageview statistics for such cases and change this number  (usually by reduction). Fairness of statistics for each article in  selected language version in selected months can be assessed using such  indicators as: number of the edits and authors, page protection, the  rate of citation increasing of the article, popularity statistics of  related keywords (phrases) in Google Trends and others.

books,"Ignatius Reilly is the most unlikable protagonist I've ever seen in literature. His bizarre misadventures, where he sweeps everyone he meets into a storm of legal trouble, headache-inducing rants, and hygiene problems, are enthralling. I could barley put the book down.

The story is a great example of how to write a disgusting protagonist. I think it works because of how much effort is put on the larger world. Virtually every character in the story is an awful person, with the most relatable characters being people who have been dumped on by society. Even then, the prime focus of the story is blasting every aspect of the human race. It's scathing, it's crude (in the most articulate way possible), and it has a strange heart to it.

For most of the story, I felt almost bad for enjoying it. It had that ""dirty"" quality because it delves headlong into the gutter, but writes with a style that made me actively need to think in order to get down to that level. Then, suddenly, the story hit me with a heart. For a brief moment, even, I saw Ignatius as a human being. A disgusting, miserable excuse for a human being, but a human being nonetheless.
