books,"So I recently finished my first reading of Chinua Achebe’s “things fall apart”. This book deeply touched me in a profound way... it made made me sit deeply with different ideas explored throughout the book. Chinua’s writing style is very straightforward but manages to retain all subtle complexities internal and external. Even in chinua’s silences or passing of time with many events left unspoken of or simply mentioned briefly. This book draws you in as if you were living in the tribe... it only makes some events more heartbreaking and disturbing, such as the killing of twins, the death of Ikemefuna, the beatings of Okonkwos wives, the treatment and humiliation of the tribes men towards the end of the book, and of course the tragic Suicide of Okonkwo. Although Okonkwo had deep flaws you felt sympathy for him... you respected him and liked him despite the deep hatred and violence he was capable of... in some moments of the book he was sweet and even humorous, in the end you feel bad for him. Reading of his death in the end made me feel a deep sadness and anger at the dismissal of human life the colonizers showed him and the tribe. This book touches on colonialism, masculinity, femininity, spirituality, birth, death, loyalty, fatherland, motherland, friendship, tradition, racism, love, fear... my question to you all who have read this masterpiece of literature as well, what were some things you took away from reading this book?

This was one of the weirdest books I’ve read. Starting off, I was immediately intrigued and entertained; I was just as weirded out and confused as the protagonist. The story for Mexican gothic takes a snowball effect; it starts off small but overtime it takes on a life of its own. First small things wouldn’t add up, then it got weird… weirder ...then it got outright disturbing. Don’t take this as a negative point, I mean this in the best way possible. I read this novel over the course of like 10 days; I wanted to finish it quickly but I took my time because at some places, I needed to take a breather! I would read a chapter, then take a walk. This one time, I was reading at night and it freaked me out so much that it took me a while to fall asleep. But tbh, I take this as a good sign, because this novel delivered on its promise of horror. The ending was very satisfying, kept me guessing the whole time. 

Another thing I loved about Mexican Gothic was its pacing. It was well timed, certain events took place at the just the right time, with just the effect to make the reader feel uncomfortable but hooked onto the story at the same time. The story was unique, and the reveals made throughout the novel, if interpreted and reflected in certain ways, connected to the real world. The author does a phenomenal job at establishing several hints and nudges that reflect todays society.  

A warning to future readers: There is taboo themes throughout the novel!

books,"I had a debate with my grandad the other day. While I think most of his conspiracy theories could be debunked, I couldn't help but agree that ""1984"" is still very much relevant for our society and societies to come. 

**Intro**
The dystopian-satire novel [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) was published in 1949 as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Originally titled *The Last Man in Europe* spent a little over a year writing the manuscript despite being ill with tuberculosis. Apparently throughout its publication history, Nineteen Eighty-Four has been either banned or legally challenged as subversive or ideologically corrupting. 

**1984**
The world as we know it, has been in war and its now divided between three totalitarian super-states; Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia. Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain) is providence of Oceania and in London, ruled by The Party with Big Brother and the reader resolves around the main protagonist Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party working at the Ministry of Truth, where he rewrites historical records to conform to the state's ever-changing version of history. Will Smith is criticising The Party and Big Brother and he's against the totalitarian super-states, but he eventually meets Julia and the two begin a torrid affair; an act of rebellion as the Party insists that sex is only for reproduction. Both of them gets discovered by O'Brien, a secretly member of the Brotherhood, and he converts them into Big Brothers political rival Emmanuel Goldstein's rebel alliance. In the end &gt;!both Smith and Julia gets captured, and are constantly tortured to the point where both of them betrays one another. Both of them gets released into the public again, and they meet each other one day. Both reveal betraying the other and no longer possess feelings for one other. Winston finally accepts that he loves Big Brother.!&lt;

**My Review**
George Orwell is a challenging author. He's talented when it comes to demonstrate a point in his works and I agree with most of his philosophies (in 1984 that is) but his writing took me some time understand and I had to re-read one or two phrases now and then (I'm probably to blame tho, im kinda slow). But I still enjoyed 1984, I think it was a good read, and it's definitely still a relevant book. I was wondering if this was where the term ""Big Brother"" originated from? I like Orwell's type of satire and 1984 was amusing with iconic dialogues and thoughts from Winston Smith. I spend some days on it but it could probably be read in 4-6 hours more or less (in one sitting). 5 out of 5 books.

books,"Lately, I have been reading about early modern and even pre-early modern manuscripts from about the fifth century to about the middle of the eighth century. While not all of these manuscripts I have encountered are religious, the ones that deal with the gospel and with things like predications about the apocalypse have made me think about the Bible as a book, and about the interactions that led to connections between the development of the Christian / Catholic religion and the formation of texts. 

I’m embarrassed to say that, like the Nietszchean dullard, who has never examined where his morality came from, I have never really thought about where our ideas of Christianity come from through manuscripts and Bibles, but have quite unquestioningly taken my ideas of what Christians think of the moral good from the idea of the Bible that I listened to priests talk about during the Catholic liturgy. 

I’m even more ashamed to say that I didn’t give much thought to how this whole thing callled the bible was assembled. In the context of manuscripts and writing, it’s quite fascinating, I would imagine. I like the idea of politics, power, rich people, poor and the like all having their own ideas of how all this makes sense, and which is to be ignored and believed. 

So I was wondering, outside of Googling out some search terms about the Vulgate and the Hebrew bible, and the epistles of the saints and translations of the Vulgate into English, etc., where does one really start to find a timeline for how the ideas of Christianity coagulated (no pun intended) after Jesus‘s death? Where did the letters start and how did the letters form into gospels and how did gospels fit into the construction of the Bible? Is that even the right timeline? 

I’ll leave for a later date how emperors like Constantine were convinced by Christianity and then spread the word of Christ through the decaying Roman Empire, but before all that. Like in the first century, how did all of that writing get transmitted and assembled? What are the canonical texts? 

If some of you are wise to all of this, I apologise For being completely ignorant of things outside of just knowing the terms “Dead Sea scrolls” “Paul’s letter to the Gentiles,” etc.

This has really put me off KK and makes me wonder if he understands anything about women at all. Because now I am looking back at the CRA trilogy and notice that hmmm most of the women in romantic subplots are also quite thinly written.

 I give KK credit for understanding a woman of a more seasoned age like Lucy's mom in Sex and Vanity and Eleanor Young in CRA. Those portraits are much more compelling.",Sex and Vanity by Kevin Kwan.

books,"Roberto Bolaño’s 2666. Anything by Haruki Murakami. The English Patient. Actually about half of “great” literature. 
I understand and appreciate the quality of the writing. I hate the message and the feeling of frustrated pointlessness. 

Give me authors like Steinbeck. Madeline L’Engle. Austen. Dostoevsky. Books like Jane Eyre and East of Eden.

I just ignored some of the pages of where the kids died for it was uneasy imagining such stuff. The part where I had to forward through and not even listening to it was the part of Patrick Hockstetter &gt;!killing his baby brother. !&lt;

Like what the fuck in the world. I just forwarded through man ( listened to it on audible). When you listen to audio books, you rely a lot on your imagination to make the scene. Yea well.

books,"I used to be an absolutely aggressive reader as a child, literally bringing with me an entire beach bag to the library every Saturday to cart back and forth all the books I would check out and then bring back to return. After a bit of a lull (school, work, discovering that you can eat and watch tv at the same time, etc.) I've returned to my obsessive ways (and I truly do mean obsessive - I've read 34 books in the past month). Because of Covid I haven't been able to physically get to my library, so I've been reading ebooks through Libby, the online ebook system my library and I think many others are connected to, and I've discovered how much more practical they are. I can read them after it gets dark without turning on the light, I can get the app on my phone and read at work or on my commute as well, and I don't have to deal with the actual physical space books take up. 

As a result of this I've been wondering whether I should get a Kindle, or whether it's just as good to sticking to reading ebooks on my computer or phone. I'm a bit wary of the price, but I've heard there's good features and I want to hear people's opinions on whether it's worth it, or not.

I listened to a reading uploaded to HorrorBabble ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TTWkjlv8OE&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TTWkjlv8OE&amp;t)) while out on a walk, and it was a fantastic experience. Barlow essentially wrote the thing, while Lovecraft made some edits or additions. Don't get me wrong, I love Lovecraft, but it seems like his name was stuck to this story despite his small contribution.  That's not to say Lovecraft didn't help form Barlow's voice. Lovecraft mentored Barlow, as I understand it. But I think Barlow's voice is distinct from Lovecraft, with softer and more engaging prose. I really fell in love with this story!

Has anyone else read this piece or anything else by Barlow? Any of his poetry? Would love to hear other thoughts on this story and discuss. I would also love to read more of his stuff, and now I harbor a desire to own an original print of something with Barlow in it. This story was a beautiful mood piece!",The Night Ocean - R.H.
