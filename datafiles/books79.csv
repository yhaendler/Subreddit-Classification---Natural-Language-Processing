books,"When I was a kid I had this cool book called something along the lines of “how things work”. It had a red hardcover, maybe a gold spine, and one of those hologram pictures that change when you look at it from a different angle. This picture I think had space and like a space shuttle or something and other stuff. The book contained diagrams of how various things worked like escalators and the Golden Gate Bridge and automatic doors. I remember on one page there was a diagram of a kid blowing bubble gum and you would flip through a little wheel or something to get the next frame. It was probably on how videos worked or something. It was a fun book with little pull outs and other nick nacks. Anyway I’m looking to give this book to my 5 year old cousin and apparently my mom gave away my copy. I’m looking to buy another copy but I cannot seem to find it. I’m pretty sure the name is how things work but it might be slightly different.

books,"I can't stop thinking about this book.

""Describe the tongue of a woodpecker""

It's not necessary to know what the tongue of a woodpecker looks like or how it functions in order to paint the Mona Lisa. Or is it? Who knows, but it's just one of the many questions Leonardo would seek out the answers to.

The key to Leonardo's genius lies in his notebooks; amazing descriptions of his world and all of the wonders and curiosities that surrounded him. Perhaps his greatest skill was in his boundless curiosity and keen observation of the natural world. His thirst for knowledge was insatiable, which is evident in his constant changes in direction and focus. One day he would be studying the muscles of a horse, the next pondering the flow of water. His notebooks also prove that he was a mortal man; jotting down to-do lists and groceries in the margin of a page containing mechanical drawings for how a siphon might work. He was flamboyant, gay, whimsical and enjoyed a touch of fantasy.

And, of course, there are the paintings. Walter Isaacson does a wonderful job of introducing each painting in its proper time and place. Where was Leonardo at the time; Florence, Milan? What was he studying; human anatomy, engineering, water eddies, geology? And how did his experiences and learning affect his painting? What I learned is that the Mona Lisa, sixteen years in the making, is the masterpiece that it is because it represents the culmination of a lifetime spent in ceaseless discovery.

The takeaway for me is to be more like Leonardo: be relentlessly curious, retain a childlike wonder, see things unseen, get distracted, procrastinate, be open to mystery.","Leonardo da Vinci by Walter Isaacson - wow, just wow",1611961439

books,"We recently started reading HOD in my English class for our unit on Impressionism and I’m loving the deep descriptions so far. 

Today in class, we touched on the criticisms of HOD, particularly ones related to how the natives are depicted and whether the book conveys racist sentiments. Some of my peers believe that the depiction of the natives and Africa itself are quite damning for the book, and they believe we shouldn’t read it. While I understand their point of view, I didn’t find it reasonable for them to be judging Conrad based on our 21st century standards of what is right and wrong. 

Was he probably racist by our standards? Yes. But I’m assuming that, for his time, he was probably quite progressive in his views of colonisation. 

Conrad was a product of his time, so why should his literary contributions be disregarded just because he doesn’t mesh well with our 21st century ideas?

books,"The Black Lives Matter movement is an incredible movement that highlights the brutality of the police towards people of colour as well as demonstrating how every life matters. I actively participate in the movement, however, as I am not a person of colour, I did not truly understand the true nature of it all, of course I felt the anger, frustration, and the hurt. But I didn’t truly understand and could not relate the way it affects people. But this book offers such a brilliant perspective into the extent police brutality can affect the lives, the ways in which the media manipulates the public to justify their disgusting behaviour; it shows it all from the point of view of a girl so deeply affected by police brutality. 

Not only is this book so incredibly written whilst making you feel as though you are truly connecting to all the characters, it sheds light into how badly action needs to happen. Black Lives Matter is not just a trend, change still needs to happen, and that can begin with educating ourselves, this book is a brilliant way to do so.

The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.
