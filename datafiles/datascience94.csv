datascience,"I routinely have to compare sets of data that share a unique ID, either to find where the two datasets are different (IDs present in the first file and not the second, values that are different in one of two tables) or to append values from one file in another based on ID.

I asked my company for a tool to better handle this level of data and they told me to use Power BI.

datascience,"Hi,

I hope this is sufficiently on topic for this subreddit; if it isn't, I'd appreciate a redirect to an appropriate forum (Kaggle?). I'm an experienced Python developer, I work with data scientists but I'm not a data scientist myself. Separately, I'm also a player on an online game/hobbyist community called [FAF](http://www.faforever.com). This post is about the hobby, no career intentions.

I think there's an opportunity for a nice data project around FAF game history: ~all 1v1 FAF games are recorded, and the dataset of game metadata and binary replay blob file is publicly available (as are solid parsers for the replay blob). I didn't yet scrape the entire dataset, but it's on the order of 100k-1m games (I've got about 35K).

The metadata for each game includes things like the two players' ladder rating before the game, the ""faction"" and ""map"" they played on (these are game details), the duration and outcome of the game (win/lose/draw), etc. The replay blob has every command issued by the players; I can't reconstruct the game (=~reimplement the engine bug for bug), but there are lots of features I can extract: opening strategy (first few commands), player actions per minute (""who clicked faster""), chosen mix of units (did they build more X or Y), etc.

Now my question: I'm looking for a holiday/hobby project, and while I can *feel* there are pretty cool data science/dataviz projects here, I'm finding it hard to exactly articulate a plan. Silly, but can you help me scope my own pet project? I'll try learn whatever I'll need, but I need help focusing my exploration. I'd also appreciate references to analyses of other games (chess? starcraft?), maybe I could mimic others' work on this dataset.

Offhand, I think the obvious project is ""predict game outcome based on features"". I can prolly handle all the data engineering aspects, e.g., generate a Parquet/Pandas DF with a row per game and a few dozen feature columns from metadata+replay. But... now what? Reading around, I think ""try and fit an [OLS](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS.html#statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS)"" is the right next step, and then iteratively engineer the features to improve predictions. But I could easily be convinced to go another (especially easier :) direction.

I am looking for a way to get a quick overview of the data contained in a dataframe. Plotting the data doesnt really do the trick because the non-numerical data is what interest me in the dataframes. I mostly use the uniqe values and value count functions in pandas to get a high level overview of the contained data but I find it a bit clumsy. I would like to display all the dataframes, their columns and respective uniqe values all at once, and that use this as a reference for further work.

datascience,"I'm 25. For the past three years I worked in sports analytics. Basically data collection, explaining data, and helping with strategy rollout. Next to no day-to-day experience with Excel, SQL, Python, whatever. My job was very niche and now that I've left that industry because it's been crippled by COVID, I'm just looking for jobs to survive. The job search has been grueling. My industry, while it had transferable skills, left me with next to no technical skills. I realize it was a dumb mistake, but when I started at 21 it was the dream and I pursued it without much background. 

Anyway, I started grad school in March 2020 for CompSci. I got my undergrad in 2017 in Business. I like my program and am probably about as good as you'd expect someone to be in 4 semesters. I graduate in Spring 2023 if all goes well. I like it, I find more meaning in it, but I'm by no means a confident programmer. Frankly, I'm leaning towards Data Science, where I'd really only necessarily need to be really good at Python. But, I'm current 6 months unemployed and too inexperienced for a CompSci job, but I hate business. 

I'm applying to everything...Marketing, Management, it's all so deflating. But, that's my undergrad, unfortunately. I get some calls about more analyst adjacent positions which excite me, but they never come to fruition. I usually fail around technical assessments. I just need to survive. But I have some PTSD-esque fear in my next move being the wrong one. For instance, one job that's speaking with me is for ""Associate, \_\_\_\_\_\_ Marketing."" The skills asked for are ""Leadership, Client Communication, Excel Fluidity Reporting, Strategy Execution, Portfolio Management."" That doesn't feel really relevant. So, let's say that's on my resume....what tech company is going to consider me? I guess I get some Excel experience in there, but that's about it. I'm scared of being boxed out at 25 and I don't know how to be better equipped for more technical jobs.

My school advising has been generally useless. I have a 3.8 GPA, SQL is coming naturally to me. But, I don't know what to do. Currently, I need to survive. So I get that's important, but I'm scared if I get no tangible work experience, nobody in CS will hire me when I get my Master's. What can I do? Are there like any entry level jobs I could find? How do I make myself appealing to employers so I can have a full career in CS? I feel like such shit. Business was a mistake, but I didn't know better. Sports was a mistake, but I didn't know better. I feel boxed in. I want to change and be in this field. But I have no actionable path, nobody to go to, and I absolutely need to be in a place where I can succeed. I know I won't be a Senior Analyst day 1, but something that can help me build skills in a workplace setting where I can maybe earn some money. I don't know. I'm very stressed and very afraid I'm doomed to a life of sales and marketing because of a bad decision I made when I was 18.

So like on one hand, if I get an Associate Marketing job, it’s worthless on my resume. Nobody in DS will care. But, I need to eat. And I do school and presumably work full time, when will I have extra time for projects to build a portfolio.

- enough AWS to pass the practitioner and ML specialty (although I haven’t used them)
- what MLOps is and kinda/sorta where to start with it

Most of the questions were standard get-to-know-you interview questions, but when I mentioned some of my past projects with coding, the technical guy seemed to get annoyed and started drilling me about specific R and SQL functions. It was kinda insulting, like he was gatekeeping me or something. I'd heard if a company wants to test your tech skills, they'll schedule a separate tech interview or even a coding test (I've had those before), but since this was a first round interview, I wasn't prepared.

datascience,"Hello. I was hoping that maybe would be able to help me with this problem.

I am trying to apply normalization and de-normalization to my classification models. 

I 've normalized the data (X\_train, X\_test)  with MinMaxScaler after split:

(Logistic regression is one of my models, I know that I don't need to apply normalization to certain models, It was just the first on the list :)) 

    normalizer= MinMaxScaler()
    X_train = normalizer.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = normalizer.transform(X_test)

Than I've trained the model:

    log_reg = LogisticRegression()
    log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
    log_reg_pred = log_reg.predict(X_test)

Now I would like to inverse\_transform the predictions to test it with ""not normalized"" y\_test but when I try this:

    real_pred = normalizer.inverse_transform(log_reg_pred)

I get an error:   
""Reshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample."" 

Now when I try this:

    log_reg_pred_reshape = log_reg_pred.reshape(-1, 1)
    real_pred = normalizer.inverse_transform(log_reg_pred_reshape)

I get: "" non-broadcastable output operand with shape (1022,1) doesn't match the broadcast shape (1022,18) ""

I understand the error but I simply don't know what to inverse. X\_train? Something else? Or should I apply normalization to y\_train as well?

\- Develop Data Pipelines to collect data (real time sourced from the internet + static data pre-loaded)...

\- Store data in a cloud data store (AWS/Google/Azure/Snowflake)

\- Analyze data and present to customer on front end tableau dashboards

I am thinking of the following tools:

**Data Sources:** Depending size, either API calls to social media/news data, or pySpark Streaming. Automated, running 3-4 times a day

**Data Cloud Store:** Aggregates data sourced from real time sources, with static sources (S3 buckets or something similar)

**SciKit Learn + Pipelines:** Automated modelling and analysis 

**Tableau:** Receives output of SciKit Learn models + grabs data directly from Cloud Data Stores for interactive visualizations

If it's not, is this at least a lucrative path?

I also asked what they expected the salary to be if I were to be hired full time (or even the fulltime unpaid position they were advertising) and it was $15/hr, and $45k/yr for more experienced people. They said ""there are tons of people willing to work for $15/hr for this type of role right now and it's more for the exit opportunity"" and ""this job won't be about the salary, people are coming to us because they believe in the mission and they want the stock options as new employees"".

datascience,"Howdy!

We've just added another few free dataset downloads to our project (Gourdian), this time from the EPA Air Quality System, daily levels of the following pollutants from measuring stations throughout the US, going back to 1980:

* Carbon Monoxide (CO): https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs.co_daily_summary
* Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2): https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs.no2_daily_summary
* Ozone (O3): https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs.ozone_daily_summary
* Sulfur Dioxide (SO2): https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs.so2_daily_summary

This dataset is only updated twice per year.

Why should you care about these things? Well, they're pretty nasty pollutants, which frequently affect human health, especially over long exposure periods. Perhaps concentrations should affect where we build homes more than they do, for example? They're also useful proxies for various types of human activity.

**Carbon monoxide** can be deadly in high concentrations, as it binds to hemoglobin, and makes it so that one's blood can't carry as much oxygen. Created via combustion of fossil fuels.

**Nitrogen dioxide** is one of the results of road traffic and other fossil fuel combustion, is one of the precursors for other harmful pollutants such as ozone and particulates, and plays a role in the formation of acid rain (it becomes nitric acid). It's also generally correlated with exposure to other byproducts of road traffic, many of which have been linked to respiratory illnesses and systemic inflammation, which can lead to a whole host of other health issues.

**Ozone** is a powerful oxidant, which makes it so that it can cause damage to respiratory tissues. It also attacks various polymers like rubber, eventually causing it to crack. It's formed primarily from photochemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (like NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). High concentrations aren't limited to urban areas, however, and it can travel hundreds of miles downwind from the source.

Finally, **sulfur dioxide**. Formed largely by the combustion of fossil fuels with high levels of sulfur, as well as volcanic activity. It's a precursor to acid rain (it becomes sulfuric acid). Sulfur dioxide is known to be at least mildly toxic, and can be hazardous in high concentrations. Long term exposure to low concentrations can also be problematic. The amount of sulfur in fossil fuels vary widely by type - automotive gasoline has much less than bunker fuel commonly used by container ships, for example.

If you'd like to download any part of these, you can filter down to the parts you care part via the lat/long filter (button on the map to select area) or by year, via sliders. As you do this, the download size noted on the download button in the upper right should change. When you've got the part you want, click download, and you should get a CSV.

A bit about our goals and what we're trying to build:

* Filter (optional), click the button, CSV arrives on your hard drive
* Downloads are always a single CSV, no bundles with weird directory structures, no other formats
* CSVs are indexed and filterable by a few column types (lat/long and date/time at the moment), so you can download just the parts you want
* Open licensed datasets are free to download
* No signup required for downloading open datasets
* Search within and across datasets
