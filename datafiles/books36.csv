I have often wished that there was something similar for books (technically you can tag books on doesthedogdie, but very few books are actually posted). 

I'm putting together a virtual book display for a class I'm taking and I would love to add in trigger warnings as I'm interested to see if other people think they would be beneficial. One genre that I thought might be well-served by having such warnings is Domestic Noir as it is especially likely to feature common triggers. I've put together a list of ten popular books in that genre that I am going to include in the display. I have read them all, but I'm concerned that I don't remember the details well enough to apply the trigger warnings correctly. If you have read any of these and remember if they feature the following types of content, I would love to hear from you!

&amp;#x200B;

The warnings I thought would be most relevant are:

Animal Abuse

Child Abuse

Death

Graphic Violence

Incest

Nonconsensual Sexual Content

Physical Abuse

Sexual Content

&amp;#x200B;

The books I am focused on are:

Gone Girl - Gillian Flynn

The Silent Wife - A.S.A. Harrison

The Widow - Fiona Barton

The Girl Before - J. P. Delaney

The Wife Between Us - Greer Hendricks

My Lovely Wife - Samantha Downing

On the surface these novels are about mystical creatures from a Middle Eastern mythology but these novels are also delve into themes of family; love; racial inequality; acceptance; honour to name but a few.. These books are beautifully written with the descriptions of the various creatures and tribes jumping off the page.

It's a real shame that we will never get to see what path Chichikov chooses to go on, never mind see the conclusion of his misadventures.

I was already reading ahead of my class and all that so theoretically I probably could’ve finished it no problem, but it was a very thick volume with no pictures and I had only barely graduated from American Girl books and thus found Heidi a bit intimidating, so into the closet it went to collect dust for over a decade. 

My aunt recently passed and I dug up that copy of Heidi to read it in her honor, but I’m finding it a little dry. I know it’s a beloved classic and I really want to finish it to honor my aunt’s memory since it was one of her favorites, but I’m just not sure what to make of it or if it gets “better.” I usually love old-timey classics and Bildungsroman/coming-of-age stuff so that’s not the issue.

books,"My take on non fiction is that it's a mixed bag... and there are all sorts of things there, such as science, popular science, textbooks, biographies, history, geography, philosophy, etc...

I think it's great to read as much good non-fiction as possible to get a deeper understanding of the world, and to simply stimulate your mind, or even benefit from it in various ways including financial.

The  thing is I may actually ***prefer non-fiction to fiction***, and if I set a general reading goal, in which everything counts as reading, I might use it as a  good excuse not to read fiction.

That's why when I speak about reading goals I think about reading fiction.

I might be a bit harsh on myself and pushing myself, yes, it's  true... that's because I think reading fiction is whole another category, and even if it might be hard for me to start reading a book, I never regretted reading a good novel, and I think it's good for people to read quality fiction.

I think reading good novels, short stories, dramas etc. is what most people refer to when they think of reading, and this particular type of reading is shown to have enormous benefits, while being pleasurabe aesthetic experience at the same time. It's literally nourishment for our mind, and not just intellect, but our whole psyche, including emotions, empathy, relating to other people, etc...

This stuff can be present in non-fiction, but it doesn't need to. But it's almost always present in fiction.

***Non fiction is also excellent, but usually for other reasons, that I mentioned before.*** 

So when I set goal of say, 30 minutes per day, it's dedicated exlusively to fiction, and seen as obligatory.

On the other hand for non-fiction I don't set goals, and I don't  treat it as obligatory, it's totally optional... and yet, in the end, I  usually end-up reading more non-fiction than fiction.

After all I'm online all the time, and most of the time, I am reading  something, such as forum discussions, articles, etc... which is all  non-fiction. Yet I never count it in my reading time. If I allowed non-fiction to be  counted in my reading time, I could never know where to set the line, and  what's counted and what not...

Should textbooks be counted? What about esseys? What about popular science? What about memoirs? What about biographies? What about manuals? What about websites? What about encyclopedia articles?

By not including non-fiction, I make a clear distinction about what's included in my reading goals, and what is optional.

I might sometimes  make an exception and count  memoirs or other personal non-fictional narratives in my reading time, but it's an  exception, not a rule.","Non fiction (why I don't count it as reading) - a very personal reason, don't get me wrong",1593027624

books,"I'm merely a student in high school in passing, and I hope to make reading literature a little less painful for others.   


It's neat to me that people start enjoying books that they originally might've disliked or not cared for before. Thus, I have been thinking if there was any possible way to make the ""click"" happen earlier?   


One of the aspects that I think is crucial to comprehension is fostering the correct environment. For example, students dislike reading boomer books in classroom environments because   
A. it doesn't make sense.  
B. it's boring because it doesn't make sense.  
C. Why is this Thorough whatever guy talking about eyeballs?????  


In my personal experience, *Fahrenheit 451* / *1984* or even Coleridge's *Rime of the Ancient Mariner* are both fairly interesting and relevant. The former two were both received rather well in my high school's English class, and I would like to believe that should be credited to the teacher that would foster a healthy group discussion around tying the concepts within the books to the present/future. It became easy for people to feel engaged when the topic became tangible and relatable. On the other hand, Coleridge's poem made zero sense, and I only enjoyed it recently after sitting down and reading it again. Of course, to compare Bradbury and Coleridge would be a crime almost. The bias is also there too for Bradbury's works since no one liked Shakespeare as usual.

It's just not believable, eg a book im reading now one charcter is 13 and has been kidnapped, she is showing unmatched calmness and logic in the back of a van. She is trying to limit her water intake from her backpack, checking how much food she has, mapping how large the area of the van is by using some bump on the floor as a guide. What 13 year old would do that?

Another example is Kafka on the Shore (i enjoyed the book) but Kafka who is 15 was incredibly smart, especially of his analysis of situations, topics of discussion and gauging human emotions, it feels to me like the author talking (obviously it is but i should feel the character is a person not what the authors dialogue is if that makes sense). 

One example of a young character done correctly is the kid in As I lay Dying, whenever he talks most of the stuff is immature and doesnt make sense which makes sense.

One of the aspects I don't like is the mild way that book presents the extermination camps. Another is that there's little to none character development, that even at the very end Bruno didn't sympathize with Shmuel, or even if he (most probably) did, the author doesn't make this clear. In their meetings, Bruno was complaing about his life, not understanding that Shmuel's life was much, much worse, so I was expecting that at the end he would apology to Shmuel, since they didn't understood the gravity of the situation.

Although I don't fully like it, I think the author does a pretty good job by making us see the racism through a child's eyes. Also, the ending was quite unexpected.

I was always told reading was a good habit to have so I joined this subreddit looking for possible books to read and saw a post that the publisher Tor was giving a free e-book called ""The Way of Kings"" and decided to download it and start reading not realising how large the book was.

I finally decided to buy the physical copy which made me realise how huge the book is which made me happy knowing I have so much more to read, if I hadn't downloaded the e-book not realising the size I would've been too intimidated to start such a large book.

books,"I saw a post here earlier that mentioned people’s book shelves allow them to see what sort of person they are based on what they read. I think it might be interesting to see how right or wrong someone could be. For instance, some books go unread on shelves for years—is that indicative of that person’s self or would it be a misjudgment? Should you look at books that seem most tattered or worn? And how much do you think a bookshelf *actually* reveals about you?

I will do mine first. My bookshelves have changed drastically. They went from being overstuffed and full of my childhood books, with multiple layers of books stacked into the sagging shelves. Now it is down to one small (mostly decorative) shelf and other books spread around the house. This is mostly due to the fact that I have broken many cheap particle board bookshelves from the weight of all my books. They also are not in any particular order, but my favorites are on the top. I have all of Jane Austen’s novels, Jane Eyre, a book on poisonous plants, To Kill a Mockingbird, In Cold Blood, and then an old copy of Sherlock Holmes. Beneath that is a YA series of books which is a gender-bending version of Sherlock Holmes by Brittany Cavallaro. I have historical romance fictions based on Ernest Hemingway, F Scott Fitzgerald, Edgar Allan Poe, and Frank Lloyd Wright. I also have books by Henry David Thoreau, Mary Shelley, Louisa May Alcott, and collections of poems by Emily Dickinson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. I also have “Mean Spirit” by Linda Hogan. I have another YA series about a retelling of Beauty and the Beast as well.

So, if I were Sherlock (or someone else with the power of deduction) I would look at my own shelf and probably make the following deductions: 

1. Likes to be immersive in the past or fantasy. 
2. Finds value in female writers throughout history (90% of the shelf is composed of female writers) so the owner is probably a woman. 
3. The only organization on the shelf is that series are placed together in the order they should be read and same authors are grouped together (thus the mind is capable of organization, but lacks the discipline to do it well.)
