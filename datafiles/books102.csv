I‚Äôve just finished the first book and I‚Äôm kinda confused as to who knows what happened in Chyurda.

Verity - knows of everything that happened

Shrewd - ? This one I have no clue about

Kettricken - I‚Äôm not sure if she knows Regal was the one who poisoned Rurisk and then tried to kill Fitz and Burrich? But then, Verity would probably tell her everything, wouldn‚Äôt he?

Burrich - knows Fitz is an assassin? Also knows about Regals plot

Chade - probably knows of everything since it‚Äôs Chade? And also because Fitz would tell him 

Hands - probably clueless but it‚Äôs weird he waited for Fitz and Burrich and went with them. Wouldn‚Äôt he also suspect anything seeing them being in such a miserable state?

My question is - is my deduction here correct? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs mostly not. Could anybody tell me what everyone knows and doesn‚Äôt know? I‚Äôd appreciate that greatly.",Questions for people who‚Äôve read the Farseer trilogy (Assassin‚Äôs apprentice),1621896572

books,"Where to even begin? 

My interest in George Eliot was ignited when I stumbled upon [this quote](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lzpep5/what_quote_from_a_book_actually_made_you_think/gq3g4es/?context=3) from her masterpiece *Middlemarch*: 

""But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.""

Beyond the beauty of the language itself, the theme of that excerpt really struck me. The positive impact of every day people is something that I cherish and try to be mindful of every day, and Eliot managed to package it so beautifully yet effectively that it almost stopped me in my tracks. I knew that her bibliography would be another unknown world to conquer. 

Someone (pointed me in the direction of *Silas Marner*, and as it was a quick read, I amicably jumped upon it. The irony now is that I almost wish it was longer, allowing me to spend more time in the luscious and picturesque English countryside of Raveloe with its equally warm inhabitants.  

The books checks off a lot of boxes for me. A large part of that has to be Eliot's prose. I've seen it described as flowery and self-indulgent, but it's the kind of thing that I can't get enough of. She spends a lot of her time dropping little bits of wisdom, spot on coverage of the human condition: 

**""Things look dim to old folks: they'd need have some young eyes about 'em, to let 'em know the world's the same as it used to be.""**

**""That quiet mutual gaze of a trusting husband and wife is like the first moment of rest or refuge from a great weariness or great danger - not to be interfered with by speech or action which would distract the sensations from the fresh enjoyment of repose.""**

**""Perfect love has a breath of poetry which can exalt the relations of the least-instructed human beings.""**

I mean, come on!

**""I suppose it is the way with all men and women who reach middle age without the clear perception that life never can be thoroughly joyous; under the vague dulness of the grey hours, dissatisfaction seeks a definite object, and finds it in the privation of untried good. Dissatisfaction seated musingly on a childless hearth, thinks with envy of the father whose return is greeted by young voices- seated at the meal where the little heads rise one above another like nursery plants, it sees a black care hovering behind every one of them, and think the impulses by which men abandon freedom, and seek for ties, are surely nothing but brief madness.""** 

I can't remember the last time passage after passage completely bowled me over since [Steinbeck's East of Eden](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/n387nd/and_now_that_you_dont_have_to_be_perfect_you_can/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). 

Yet Eliot's writing ability also includes her talent for drama. The book has a way of sometimes casually hinting things at the audience, allowing them to fill in the blanks before eventually dropping any pretenses, such as Godfrey and Nancy's conflict on adoption. Little moments like that and the reveal of a now grown-up &gt;!Aaron!&lt; as the boy eyeing Eppie put a smile on my face. The book also doesn't shy away from throwing curveballs at the audience. &gt;!The reveal of Dunstan's corpse!&lt; immediately comes to mind for me. But it was Chapter 19 in particular that I found to be a masterclass in tension and drama, my heart beating heavily as I witnessed &gt;!Godfrey and Nancy's attempts at taking Eppie away. !&lt;It was quite the emotional rollercoaster: &gt;!the anger I felt for Godfrey‚Äôs arrogance and Nancy's passivity, the love I felt for Silas‚Äôs passion, and the admiration I held for Eppie‚Äôs loyalty.!&lt; I could feel myself itching closer to tears while reading it.  

Eliot's characterization was also wonderful as well. The characters are very human: some are flawed, but having an innate sense of good in them that eventually shines through. I found Silas Marner to be such a wonderful character to follow, a true embodiment of the George Carlin quote &gt;!‚ÄúScratch any cynic and you will find a disappointed idealist.‚Äù!&lt; I found it touching to witness his eventual transformation &gt;!from an angry and bitter miser to a man fueled by such love and tenderness. Though this change is largely fueled by Eppie, he had it in him the whole time :) !&lt;Godfrey Cass too makes for an interesting figure to follow. He's a bit messy and makes some questionable decisions, but he's ultimately trying to just get by, attempting have his cake and eat it too. His own arc is touching, albeit bittersweet. Yet aptly so. 

It's just an all-around well-written book. And it's under 200 pages! I recommend it highly, especially, interestingly enough, to those who are fans of John Steinbeck. I find that Eliot scratches that same itch that Steinbeck does for me, a similar understanding of humans and poetic mastery of prose, but in her own style.","Silas Marner is thus far my favorite read of 2021.

I hope you and your loved ones are doing well in these unprecedented times.  
 

I am not sure how closely you have been following the cryptocurrency news recently. In case you have not joined the Pi Network yet, I am sending you an invitation.  
 

Pi is a new digital currency introduced on Pi Day (3/14) in 2019. It is a new type of blockchain technology developed at Stanford. It uses smartphones instead of computers. The ""mining"" process for each coin does not require solving puzzles, wasting energy, or using your phone data. You just mine it by tapping the app once a day to confirm you are human.  
 

As part of your invitation, I am sending you 1œÄ!

To claim your Pi, download the Pi Network app (on an iPhone or Android device) and use my username (DrEEEEE) as your invitation code.  
 

Pi is not a scam. You can Google it, search for the core team members and view their published articles and citations on Google Scholar, view their social media to confirm network growth and updates, watch countless videos from many trusted sources explaining the technology and concept. The Pi Network channel on Youtube is hosted by the founders explaining the network and technology in the videos. You should also check out the comments and questions below those videos to see the intense enthusiasm and interest in this new project. Once you download the app, you can also view the latest information and messages from core team members, who are all Standford University Ph.D. and MBA recipients. The founder, my colleague Dr. Kokkalis, lectures a cryptocurrency course at Stanford, so their updates include the videos of these lectures as well. I have learned quite a lot from them just in the past few weeks since I joined.  
 

The network is growing quickly. It reached 14 million members last month. The core team members plan to close the network and end the mining process when the network reaches around 100 million members. At that time, you will be able to trade the Pi you have mined for actual currencies, just like Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. The members of the network will also be rewarded for any transaction fees collected and advertising revenue from their app. Also, their network is already open to programmers to develop apps specific to that network. All of the revenue generated will also be shared with the network members daily. The daily active users and the large ecosystem created by the network give Pi a certain value other cryptocurrencies do not possess.  
 

Pi was launched as a three-phase project. The first phase involved growing the network and mining a limited number of coins. The second phase of testing the network is already running. The third and final phase will be Mainnet. This is the phase where you can actually trade the Pi you have earned. The Mainnet phase is expected to be launched within months.   
 

As the network expands, the mining rate (currently 0.1 Pi per hour) is cut in half at each benchmark, such as 10 million, 100 million members, etc. This halving is intended to create the ""scarcity"" concept. Similar to Bitcoin, the total number of Pi created will be limited. I am sure you have heard the Bitcoin halving (mining rate being cut in half) last year created enormous demand, sending the price of one Bitcoin to over $61K recently! At this time, we don't know exactly how much each Pi will be worth once trading starts at the third phase of the project. Estimates range from a few cents to a few dollars per Pi. However, it is not unusual for a new cryptocurrency to experience 100 or even 1000-fold increases in value within a year. In case you are not familiar with cryptocurrency values, you can search historical prices for Bitcoin and Ether to see these exponential increases.

 Once you join the network, you will also be receiving 25% of the Pi I am mining daily as a bonus. This also applies to everyone who joins your team in the future. This incentive structure has helped them grow their network so quickly. The app also allows you to see how much your ""team"" is mining in real-time. Pretty exciting and engaging, in my opinion. You can currently mine almost 3 Pi a day with just me as your one team member to start. If you have a decent size network, that number can get much higher.  
 

Feel free to read the FAQ and white paper explaining the concept on their secure website, minepi dot com. Once you download the app you will need the invitation code DrEEEEE to create your account, since every member needs an invitation to sign up. When you accept you will see me listed as a verified member, under your Earning Team.  
 

Keep in mind that they are planning to close the network when they reach around 100 million members and the Pi mining rate will eventually be reduced to zero, limiting the total number of Pi in circulation and increasing the value of each Pi mined until then. The network growth rate so far seems to be around 20% a month and Pi already has more daily active users than any other cryptocurrency!   
 

If you have any questions about Pi, the technology, digital currencies, or finance in general, I am happy to help any time.

books,"Andy Weir had a smash success with his first novel, The Martian. While it probably didn't have a lot of pure literary merit, it was unabashedly geeky, thrilling, fun and entirely deserving of all the accolades and the impact it made on the current sci-fi landscape.

His next novel, Artemis, magnified all the faults of the first while retaining none of the charm. Attempts to write a more complex plot left it a heavy, jumbled mess. The lack of real characters or character development in The Martian was excusable. In Artemis all attempts at it were forced and cringey. The science and long technical explanations went from seamlessly driving¬†the narrative in The Martian to hampering it to the extent where you get actively frustrated by them. In short ‚Äì nothing worked.

Project Hail Mary is, in a sense, a return to the author's roots. Like in The Martian, the protagonist is a genius and witty scientist caught alone in a bad situation who must use his knowledge to fix things. The stakes are a lot higher. Instead of Mars, this time he is on a spaceship far away from Earth. Instead of saving just himself this time all of humanity is on the line. Oh and he has amnesia, so isn't able to remember the ship, his mission or even his own name.

What follows is a saga of exploration, trial and error, mess ups, fixes, near deaths etc. as he inches closer to his goal. It's The Martian on steroids, and the author makes no excuses for it.

Some of the author's faults still stood this time around. I'm putting some of them in spoiler tags to be safe, but they aren't really spoilers so read them if you'd like.

* At 500 pages, it is a bit of a slog. There are a lot of repetitive parts and could have been easily edited down another 100 pages at least.
* I found it harder to excuse the juvenile writing this time around considering the author is on his *third* bestselling novel. There is so much wrong with pacing, narrative structure, characters, exposition etc. that ""yeah, science!"" won't magically fix.
* The science stuff ‚Äì¬†&gt;!While the scientific explanations and overall plot in The Martian made some amount of sense, Project Hail Mary makes you take one too many massive leaps of logic. That isn't a deal breaker for a sci-fi book by any means, but the author's writing style emphasizes the ""science"" side while giving you a story which would fit better in The Expanse.!&lt;
* The protagonist ‚Äì¬†&gt;!For both better and worse, the protagonist is Mark Watney 2.0. He is a genius at every possible science, has all the knowledge of the world at the tip of his tongue, is witty, commanding when he needs to be, selfless, empathetic...Oh and he has six pack abs of course. While Mark Watney came off as charming, this one is just..dull.!&lt;

With sci-fi tastes as varied as they are, it's hard to predict how the average reader will feel about Project Hail Mary. There are a lot of fun moments, some thrills and a lot of faults. So I will simply say that if you liked The Martian, you will probably like this one as well.","If you liked The Martian, you should read Project Hail Mary",1621875003

books,"I saw that a lot of people in this sub liked Circe, so I decided to read it. I'm not familiar with Circe in mythology, and all I knew about the book when I went into it was that it had strong feminist themes. I expected to enjoy it because of the feminist themes, but after I finished the book, I found that I felt... lukewarm about the book? It is an objectively good book but, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. 

I really, really enjoyed the start of the book and I felt it was really strong. I absolutely loved Circe's interaction with Prometheus. And I especially loved it when Circe owned up to cursing Scylla, because it was really the first time she was being unapologetic about her strength in front of her abusive family.

But at one point through the middle of the book, I found it tedious to read through. I found myself thinking ""Another man she gets along well with, I wonder how long until she sleeps with this one.""

What really caught me off guard was Circe being sexually assaulted. I went into this blind and I had to put the book down for a couple of days because I'd missed that trigger warning, lol. In my opinion, using sexual assault to ""empower"" or to ""to contribute to the character development of"" a female character feels really cheap. There are better ways to go about making a female character powerful.

After finding the middle of the book tedious to get through, I liked the end. And I really enjoyed her relationship with Penelope at the end, I was just disappointed we didn't see more female friendships throughout the book.",I didn't enjoy Circe as much as I thought I would,1621873838

I read somewhere that having some basic understanding of the historical context and a list of the characters, or at least their relationship to one another, is something worth focusing on as a pretext to the text.

What would you guys suggest?

By the way, if this is worth mentioning, this is my introduction to Tolstoy.

I just want to know if the book contains inappropriate content and where I should avoid it. If we pretend I'm 12 years old ( which I assure you am far from being so) and reading this book, (ignoring gore and drug abuse) which parts of the book should I be avoiding.

books,"Game of Thrones' problems in the last seasons aren't due to random fuckups by the showrunners, but rather flaws built into the story itself that Martin himself can't actually solve.

The reason why season 7 was rushing around the continent with no regard for logistics is the same reason that Martin can't actually figure out how to resolve the story, namely that the story hinges on all these big events which require specific characters to be in specific places at specific times, but making that happen means either just handwaving away the journey and ignoring distance (the show approach), or actually detailing the journey and getting bogged down with lots of secondary characters and plot arcs who aren't actually interesting (the Martin approach). Like, people got super mad at the show for making Dorne incredibly lame and mishandling the Greyjoys...but the Dorne and Pyke chapters are some of the weakest parts of Martin's books too. That shitty book chapters became shitty tv scenes isn't exactly surprising.

Martin is going to die without ever finishing his series, but the reason isn't simply laziness, its because he literally has written himself into a corner and can't bring all his plotlines together into a satisfying ending without either getting lost in the weeds (like how trying to get timelines on track lead to 400 pages of boring Meereen politics in ADWD), or doing the same sort of teleporting/handwaving shit that the show's had to resort to lately. He knows that's unsatisfying but he doesn't have another solution, so he just endlessly spins his wheels.

Not only do I not think book 6 is ever coming out, but if it does I don't actually expect it to be better than the season 6 the show already gave us. It may be stronger in some ways (e.g. Stannis, who the show never really knew what to do with), but there's also a very, very high likelihood that like books 4 and 5 it also has tons of drawn out boring filler as Martin desperately tries and fails to corral all his narrative threads into something that can actually end.",An old rant on Game Of Thrones,1621856509
