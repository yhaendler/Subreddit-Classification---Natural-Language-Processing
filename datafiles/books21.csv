books,"Hi All,

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this; it's a bit of a weird request. I have an old cloth-bound copy of Gibbon's *Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* that was published in the '60s and is a family heirloom. I inherited this book when I was young, and I was not mature enough to read it when I received it. It has therefore sat on the floor of my childhood bedroom for years. Unfortunately, the place where it sat was also the resting place of an egg of silly putty that was stuck in the carpet. I retrieved the book today to cite in an essay, and learned that the silly putty left a stain in the cover of my book. Is there any way to remove this stain?",Old Book Maintenance,1586476545

books,"It all starts out as a simple adventure story, oddly easygoing for a post-apocalypse. Then Ish tries to shake his people up so they will be more than just scavengers. The last third hit me like a train. Isherwood Williams has one of the most tragic stories in any work of literature. I'm being very bold here, but I'm going to say that this is a deeper tragedy than anything Shakespeare or Sophocles wrote. It really is that powerful. I'm not even trying to be hyperbolic. Spoilers as to why I think this:

&gt;!Ish wants to preserve knowledge and one day rebuild civilization. The children of the tribe don't understand the importance of his lessons, because they have no relevance to growing up in a tribe of scavengers and hunters, which is nothing like growing up in the pre-disaster world. Only Joey takes to learning. Then Joey dies. Ish has a mental breakdown outside his beloved library as he realizes the conditions of the post-disaster world and the tribe were thwarting him all along, ""The stars in their courses"". All his hopes of knowledge and civilization are gone forever. These things will die with him. He failed. Nothing is more tragic than this. It's nice that he teaches the kids how to shoot a wooden bow afterwards, but it's also an admission of defeat; he's doing this because he's not even bothering them with book learning anymore. Most tragic heroes, at worst, bring misfortune upon a country. Ish's failure meant that all of mankind's education is gone forever, as well as any sense of continuity with the past or tradition. The entire cultural slate is wiped empty. It's a whole nother level of tragedy.!&lt;

&gt;!Ish grows old and watches the first generation of survivors die. He even watches his friend Ezra and his wife Em die. He is the Last American. He grows old enough to become a feeble old man and watches his tribe drift more in the direction of a superstitious hunter-gatherer tribe. They regard him as a god, something he never wanted to become as early as the second chapter of part 1. They do not understand him or what he has experienced, and pinch him for answers. Just try to feel how lonely it must be to be the Last American among your own descendants who do not understand you at all. He is again carried past the library whose books will go unread. He dies on the Golden Gate bridge by that abandoned car, again a call back to early in part 1, showing just how much he had tried and lost since then. He did teach his people how to shoot a bow and they do seem happy with their way of life. It's not total doom and gloom, but it's still damn sad. Most (not) tragic heroes just get cut down by their enemy or something. Ish slowly watches his failure as an old man.!&lt;

And it all just starts out as a travel story. It's really not obvious just how tragic this story will become until over halfway through.

I've heard that some people don't like how Ish is kind of antisocial and superior to other people and they dislike the book because of this. That's like complaining that MacBeth is a bad play because the title character is too ambitious and murders people. Yes Ish is kind of a jerk, that's because tragic heroes have flaws. Maybe if Ish was a better people person and used different methods he would have had a better chance of achieving his goals. Maybe if Oedipus didn't get angry and kill some guy at a crossroads he wouldn't have married his mom.

Also, I know that canned food and gasoline in sealed containers would not last that long. Still didn't ruin the book for me. The book still made very clear that scavenging is not a long term option in the long run, and something will have to change.

It was amazing, and really sad.. I enjoyed it more than Riddley Walker, which wasn't a bad book but was very hard to ""get"" so I can't recommend that one to a lot of people.

I read The Handmaids Tale for CLASS and still thoroughly enjoyed it so the moment I heard of a sequel I was already apprehensive....I usually hate when authors try to dive back into a world years later and boyyyyy was I right!

The two teenage characters were laughably bland and their ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù backgrounds were evident from the first eighth of the book. Aunt Lydia was the only perspective was the only one I could enjoy and were ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS the shortest.

The plot was hamfisted and predictable. The side characters just the same rehashing of Gilead cruelty. Even Atwood‚Äôs writing (outside of the Lydia chapters) lacked that Handmaids shine.

books,"About three years ago I hit a rough patch with my studies and went through about a three month period of intense studying, during which I essentially became afraid of picking up books that weren't related to my studies. I would feel guilty about reading for fun, and I'd constantly shame myself for ""wasting time"" when I should have been writing my thesis or doing research. By the time I submitted my thesis and was finally able to take a breath, I had basically lost any and all enjoyment for leisure reading. Before, I used to read 4-8 books a month, but after the stressful spring of 2017 I would go months without reading a single page. It was truly a shocking change for someone like myself who used to live and breathe books ever since I was a child.

But now, in quarantine, my hunger for books has come back with a vengeance. I have read eleven books this past month, which is more than I have read in the past three years combined, and there's no end in sight. I have about ten books on my nightstand as we speak, waiting for me to get to them. I have been reading books on one sitting, and the best part is that I'm not getting tired! It feels so incredibly good to be able to pick up a book again without feeling that pressing guilt. I have missed my hobby so much. I have missed getting lost in stories, being excited about new releases, and feeling the anticipation of starting a new book.

I got myself a Kindle Paperwhite. I *love* it. The best purchase I have made in a long time. I'm so happy with it, and how easy it is to use - almost *too* easy as I have to fight the urge to buy everything I want. And believe me, I want to get *everything.* Horror, scifi, thrillers, mysteries, fantasy, classics, nonfiction - whatever it is, I wanna read it.

It feels wonderful to have my appetite for books back. If there's any silver lining for this horrible pandemic, this is it for me.

I was surprised by all the math used by Verne, and i think the way the stroy is narrated grabs the mind of the reader to learn how they are going to reach the moon, and i like where the story is heading, but i dont know for what reason, but in my opinion the final was written in a very precipitated way.

The main characters have in a certain superficial way already developed their personality and surpassed obstacles in the way. So at the end the just get stuck around the orbit of the moon for the eternity. In conclusion i think we can all agree that Verne has written some classics, but i dont consider this book to be one. Maybe for the time it was written i can imagine why it has had a great impact on literature , but in terms of ""spacial novels"" i consider they have been better books

This is a book that has a lot of great ideas in it. Clearly it must be, since many of the ideas were so good they made their way into real life. (The term ‚Äòavatar‚Äô was popularized by this book, and many aspects of its technology inspired real-life tech.) The world is described in no shortage of detail, from the modus operandi of Kouriers, to the mechanics and history of the Metaverse, to hyperinflation and the justice system. There‚Äôs no shortage of great worldbuilding and intriguing ideas here.

Unfortunately, that‚Äôs where my praise ends. The prose is long-winded, especially at the beginning, and it uses lots of slang to drive home the different timeframe. The story spends pages upon pages on inelegantly delivered exposition. The ideas that these exposition is explaining are frankly silly, and not in a good way. I actually started skimming over it after the first few times, and I don‚Äôt feel it damaged my experience in any way.

The plot and characters are fine. Hiro may be a bit of a Marty Stu, but that didn‚Äôt really bother me. Y.T. is fun to watch, although late in the book she has a scene which made me physically cringe. Uncle Enzo‚Äîthe mascot/owner of the Mafia‚Äîis interesting, but gets limited screentime. Many of the other characters are just bland and flat, particularly the people from Hiro‚Äôs past like Juanita or Da5id.

I‚Äôve heard speculation/analysis that this story was meant to be a parody; a satiric and/or absurdist jab at cyberpunk. In reality, the book doesn‚Äôt reach the crazy extremes needed to be interpreted as a parody. It‚Äôs self-serious and preposterous, but not in a consistent or entertaining way.

books,"I (23f) just finished the book and overall my impression of it was very good and I enjoyed it! However I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling sometimes that it felt almost like the author was writing some kind of self-insert fan fiction (given that he and the protagonist shared careers) that painted a characterization of himself as this sexy irresistible man that many women in his book just ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt help falling in love‚Äù with (or sleeping with.)

This frustrated me!
If this book was written by a woman, though, I wouldn‚Äôt have given that a second thought.

books,"It‚Äôs been 20 days since I‚Äôve posted here that I‚Äôve been starting to read again and now I‚Äôve just finished BK. I must say that reading this after not having read for such a long time is like trying to swallow an elephant. It wasn‚Äôt an easy read. Some days I could read 200 pages in one sitting, other times I feel like procrastinating on reading the last 30 pages for over three days. But all in all, I enjoyed it. It‚Äôs thought provoking and it challenges my bias even though some chapters I have been dreading to skip (Which thankfully I did not). I won‚Äôt go into details since I don‚Äôt think I am fit to discuss Brothers Karamazov thoroughly, but I will do my best to write this as honestly as I can. 

I love how Dostoyevsky portrayed the characters. They‚Äôre not two dimensional and he‚Äôs made them as human as possible, even Alyosha, who seems like an angel. Characters like Fyodor Karamazov who are ruthless, greedy and stubborn are also capable of being naive, grief-stricken and even to a point, loving. Perhaps one of the most interesting characters to me was Dmitri. Honestly the chapter when he went out partying like a madman annoyed me so much but I can‚Äôt help but feel sorry for him when he was convicted of killing his father. Although he was, for most of the story, unpleasant, he was innocent nonetheless. 

Another thing to note are the philosophical discussions that blew my mind. The Rebellion and The Grand Inquisitor were two of the most difficult chapters for me to read. I keep going back from one page to another just to see if I understand what Ivan was saying and what he was trying to get out of Alyosha. When he said that he accepts God but not the world he built, it dawned on me that most people do think like that, whether they are aware of it or not, and perhaps even me at times. In Rebellion, he discussed that justice must be served in this lifetime. And why should we wait for the next life to punish and correct the injustice if we can do it now? And there was a line when he said (non verbatim) if the greater truth comes at the expense of children suffering, then I don‚Äôt want the truth. Also the Grand Inquisitor... I don‚Äôt know if I can discuss it well but the argument on morality, the existence of God and the burden of freedom were built strongly. This idea that if God shows Himself to mankind, in power and in majesty, all that He is, then mankind would follow Him and that will put an end to all this chaos in the world. But instead, God hid himself in mystery and gave man the freedom to choose for himself, which caused unruliness ,disorder and suffering. And though Ivan said that he accepts God but he wouldn‚Äôt renounce the idea that everything is lawful, Alyosha responded gently with a kiss on his brother‚Äôs forehead. Perhaps it symbolizes that Alyosha‚Äôs love for his brother stands out more despite his questions which did bother Alyosha for a time. And it‚Äôs the same as Jesus loving the grand inquisitor instead of being intimidated by his questioning. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs plagiarism!‚Äù Ivan cried in delight. 

Honestly I hoped that Dostoyevsky had put out a second book as a sequel to Brothers Karamazov. The ending was not as I expected it to be. But I think the ending was good, nonetheless. What Alyosha said about remembering even just one good memory from childhood could save you in the future will stay with me forever. We will all grow old and maybe grow bad, do things that we thought we aren‚Äôt capable of doing but it‚Äôs not entirely who we are. We were good once and we can be good again. The symbolism of eating pancakes after the painful ordeal of burying Illusha was some sort of a reminder that even in suffering, something good will come eventually even just a little.

Brothers Karamazov is a book that I would be glad to reread in 5, 10, 20 years and I would still write in paragraphs by then about how I feel after reading it. This is already a lengthy post and I hope I conveyed my feelings well but even so, I feel this isn‚Äôt enough to praise this piece of literature.

books,"Let's be real. We all have those books that we'd recommend to everyone. Books that we'd promote so well to others that it would almost seem like their authors and publishers paid us to do so. üòÇ

Feel free to add your TOP 5s below guys. Since we're all stuck at home we might as well use this time to learn and recommend books to each other. It would also be great if you guys all write a short description about the books and how they transformed your life. I'm really excited to hear from y'all. :-))

Anyways here's mine: 

1. How to Win Friends and Influence people - Dale Carnegie

A timeless piece about making friends and influencing people - exactly like what the title says. Book was published in 1936 and uses examples and anecdotes even prior to its publication. The principles Dale Carnegie talks about are SO DAMN TIMELESS AND UNIVERSAL that they still apply today (book has also been translated in pretty much any written language). The main recurring concept in the book is to see things from the other person's perspective. 

Applying the lessons I learnt from this book transformed the way I approached my relationships, friendships, family and acquaintances. Overtime, I became capable of creating and maintaining a HUGE circle of high-quality friendships, which opened up a lot of opportunities and avenues for me. 

2. 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Stephen Covey

This book is an absolute must-read. It gave me a full-proof plan that enabled me to become a high-functioning individual. 

The 7 habits: 
Be proactive. Begin with the end in mind. Put first things first. Think Win-Win. Synergize. Sharpen the Saw. 

3. The Intelligent Investor - Benjamin Graham 

Arguably one of the best, if not the best book that has been created about investing in shares. 

According to this book the main questions we should be asking ourselves when investing in shares offered by a company/business are: 

'If I owned 100 percent of this company/business, would I be happy with the way it is? (Are the profits reasonable? Am I comfortable with the amount of debt it owes? Do I like the management? What does the management think of the company? Are they performing well enough that its employees would actually want to buy shares of their own company? Are the business's shares selling at a discount to its intrinsic value? ' 

The book is very down-to-earth and practical which forces us to invest like a business man (woman). This makes a lot of sense because when we buy shares we're buying a slice of a business. 

After reading it, I chose 4 shares based on the book's fundamental ideas and put them on a watchlist. One year later I beat the ASX 200 by 6% which aint bad because the book's the only thing I've read about investment prior to creating the watchlist. However, it hasnt been performing well recently because of COVID-19 and all the mass hysteria. 

4.Total Recall - Arnold Schwarzenegger 

Arnold Schwarzenegger's autobiography. A REAL PAGE TURNER. Arnold 'worked his ass off' but 'always had a smile in his face.' Born in a small, rural and remote Austrian town, he later moved on to become: 

- A Successful Businessman
- The Greatest Bodybuilder of All Time
- The Terminator
- Governor of California

This book literally screams the importance of PASSION, AMBITION, DETERMINATION and SHEER FOCUS. 

5. Unbroken - Laura Hillenbrand

THE Biography of Louis Zamperini. As a child he was a troublemaker (that's one way to put it) but he later moved on to become an Olympic distance runner. He then served in World War Two as a Bombardier. His plane went down crashed in the Pacific Ocean. He was stuck adrift for 47 days with two other crew mates before becoming a POW after being captured by a Japanese patrol boat. After the war, he went back home and suffered from the same issues and experiences which haunted most WW2 veterans. However, he overcame these and served others in his community. 

Books 4 and 5 were like a huge slap in the face. My main takeway from them was: 

We can complain all day and all week about the shitty things life throws at us OR we can take charge of the situation and punch our way out of shit even if the odds are against us. 

Any fool can complain but it takes  a special type of person to say 'F**k you life. You better get out of my way because I'm punching my way outta here.'",Name the TOP 5 BOOKS which transformed your life. Here's my list. I'm keen to hear from y'all. :-)),1586443449

I am trying to find a novel that I saved in my phone one or two years ago because it sounded interesting but I lost that phone so now all I got is a tiny bit of information to work with.

As far as I remember it's a series of three dystopian books (""something""-zyklus in German, I don't know if you use the term ""cycle"" in English for that) in total and the covers were kinda greenish. Either the writer had an eastern European name or it was the book. And that's already all I know.

books,"I‚Äôve recently decided to start reading books again after many years. I used to go through books like they were nothing, several a week was kind of the standard, but like many others I got used to the brevity and accessibility of the internet. 

I am fully aware that even long-form articles on the internet can afford itself certain privileges that books cannot, like being considerably shorter, and being able to be edited as time goes on. 

One thing I haven‚Äôt noticed, which I did expect in some ways, was the (over)simplification of sentences. Shorter articles open themselves up to shorter sentences after all, but in my experience that is not generally the case. Even shorter articles have decent sentence structure. 

But, and maybe that‚Äôs just me, I‚Äôve noticed a trend of the opposite on the other side. I have picked up the occasional book here and there throughout my many years of ‚Äúnot reading‚Äù and for a long time now I‚Äôve had the sense that authors try to insert absurdly long sentences into their works, almost like some weird video game achievement requirement. 

[An example of one I found in a book I am currently reading](https://i.imgur.com/imuW1BQ.jpg). I have highlighted where the sentence begins and where it ends. It is so absurdly long that I have been checking and rechecking whether I‚Äôve missed a period somewhere, but I don‚Äôt think I have. 

Am I the only one experiencing this, or is this an experience that you lot can recognise? I love reading, always have and always will, but sentences like these are not pleasant to get through, in my opinion.","Dear Authors: writing absurdly long sentences doesn‚Äôt make you look smart.
