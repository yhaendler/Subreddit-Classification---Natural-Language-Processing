datascience,"Hello everyone. For the last month I've been working on a side project to, initially for myself, keep track of notes and snippets. I've saved a lot of notes/slides during my studies but they are embedded in various formats in a google drive, and it's time consuming to go back and find the theory you need at the time you need it. As I read books and learn more I wanted a new format to store my notes that is more easily accessible. At the same time when working I noticed a lot of times you go back to old repos and copy code that you've used to use again. You could create libraries/packages but some times you just want a template/quick code snippet that you can customize for your current use case.

In my website you can save pages/markdown documents that are searchable and inside these documents you can add snippets with descriptions which in turn make them also searchable separately. This way you can chose to search both snippets and full documents. The idea is to in the markdown documents store theoretical stuff while also adding snippets that are quickly searchable.  Also if you found some awesome resource online and don't want to take notes of it but just keep the link I've added a ""add link"" option where I scrape the website and make it searchable as well (it is still a link though, I'm not stealing content). Anyway this is a very much an alpha/beta and probably contains a ton of bugs but check it out if you want to. I'd advise you to keep a local copy of all documents if you want to make sure you have the information in case of crashes and such... The site can be found at:

datascience,"Hey folks,

First of all, thank you all for your upvotes for our [package](https://github.com/kotartemiy/newscatcher). So far, we got 500+ stars on Github (and **it was on GitHub trending**), 100 sign-ups for beta and almost 1k upvotes in this subreddit.

Many people liked the package, so I decided to tell you a story about how I began to work on the project behind it, as well as share my little experience of building an end-to-end Data-as-a-Service product.

I am a full-time data engineer and [newcatcherapi.com](https://newcatcherapi.com) is one of two side projects for me. Since the beginning (December 2019), I decided to share as much as possible with the community. Here are 3 main reasons why:

1. It is a way to promote your work
2. 99% of the things that I know is a result of someone sharing his/her knowledge
3. An idea worth 0$ no matter how good it is. It's all about how you implement it. So there is no fear that someone is going to steal it

One month ago my friend joined the project and now he writes most of the Python code for it. He is also a full-time data engineer and it is a side-project for him.

# Idea

Somewhere in October-November 2019, I came up with a thought that I can build a replica of [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) \--  API that allows you to search through the news data aggregated from thousands of sources. Moreover, I thought that I can make it much cheaper. **News API costs 449$/250k API calls. I plan to have the same package for  49$.**

So I wrote my [first post about newscatcher on Medium](https://medium.com/@kotartemiy/building-a-data-as-a-service-product-from-0-to-1-intro-cce63cfad568) where I explained that I am going to build it and make updates in real-time, no matter how it ends.

The point of all that is to write updates on the go. While there are many people who write about their success stories post factum, not that many people share their failures. And, if you start to write from the very beginning, you have no choice. Whatever the result -- people will know and learn from your mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

# Motivation

**I want to build a data product from A to Z.** Idea, solution architecture, development, deployment, maintenance, promotion, product-market fit. Also, I want to get my hands dirty with AWS -- I truly believe that right now is the best moment to start implementing your ideas because of Infrastructure-as-a-Service solutions such as AWS and GCP.

One other thing that motivated me a lot is the discovery of [https://rapidapi.com/](https://rapidapi.com/). I did not know that such a thing exists! My problem was that I could not find any good way to manage API requests and payments (when I was thinking about this project). It just seemed the most difficult part for me. I did not even want to start all this because of this small issue. Then, I found out about Rapid API -- an API marketplace that is going to manage all the users, documentation and payments. It is going to charge me a 20% flat fee from every sale, but I am more than happy to pay that price to forget about my problems.

Another important point to mention is that you should not make it for money. Actually, it is quite opposite, so far I am paying the bills for AWS and other services every month. **My full-time job covers the bills for my side-projects.** So, it's more like a hobby.

&amp;#x200B;

# Solution Architecture

So, we have to build an API that will allow people to query the news data that we collect from many different sources.

Overall, it is event-driven and serverless.

Event-driven means that processes are triggered by some events. Unlike batching, you do not control when something happens.

Serverless means that there is no permanent server. It spins when you ""call"" it.

[done with https:\/\/cloudcraft.co\/](https://preview.redd.it/8jkp91q8snj41.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97c7ee10ccc8f8453fd38cd56fcabe5f3ca8237e)

1. CloudWatch Event triggers the ""orchestration lambda""
2. ""orchestration lambda"" gets the RSS feeds URLs from DynamoDB
3. ""orchestration lambda"" sends all those RSS URLs to SQS
4. each RSS URL from SQS is picked-up by Lambda that reads and normalizes the feed
5. Title+description is md5'ed so we use it as an ID for DynamoDB record. Using attribute\_not\_exists  
 of DDB, only items with unseen ID are promoted, so it solves the deduping problem
6. DDB streams collect up to 100 newly inserted records and send it to Lambda
7. Lambda insert records into Elasticsearch cluster

&amp;#x200B;

We use AWS Lambda (serverless function) a lot mainly because we need to process hundreds of processes in parallel (Step 4).  Also, such products as Dynamo DB and SQS are maintained by AWS, so you do not have to worry about ops.

The only piece that is not serverless is Elasticsearch which is the heart of the product. We store the data twice (in Dynamo and Elasticsearch) because Elasticsearch is great for indexing data and fast search, however, it does fail. Therefore, when  Elasticsearch crashes, you will lose some part of the data (from the last backup till the crash). It is easy to ""fill the gap"" when you have a copy in DynamoDB. 

It is a bit short but I will write a more detailed article on [my Medium account](https://medium.com/@kotartemiy). I'll explain everything in detail so that even people who are not familiar with AWS should understand.

Dramatically improved memory usage is the key feature of the [0.10 release](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/releases/tag/v0.10.0) of the library, with the StellarGraph and StellarDiGraph classes now backed by NumPy and Pandas. This will enable significant performance benefits.

Version 0.10 also features two new algorithms:

* Link prediction with directed GraphSAGE
* GraphWave, which computes structural node embeddings by using wavelet transforms on the graph Laplacian.

Other new algorithms and features remain under active development, but are available in this release as experimental previews. These include:

* Temporal Random Walks: random walks that respect the time that each edge occurred (stored as edge weights)[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/787)
* Watch Your Step: computes node embeddings by simulating the effect of random walks, rather than doing them.[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/750)
* ComplEx: computes embeddings for nodes and edge types in knowledge graphs, and uses these to perform link prediction[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/756)
* Neo4j connector: the GraphSAGE algorithm can execute neighbourhood sampling from a Neo4j database, so the edges of a graph do not have to fit into memory.

The new release also incorporates key bug fixes and improvements: 

* StellarGraph now supports[ TensorFlow 2.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.1.0) 
* Demos now focus on Jupyter notebooks
* Supervised GraphSAGE Node Attribute Inference algorithm is now reproducible
* Code for saliency maps/interpretability refactored to have more sharing, making it cleaner and easier to extend[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/855)
* Demo notebooks predominantly tested on CI using Papermill, so won't become out of date.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently enrolled in a top university (HYPS-level), with an undergraduate in mathematics and graduate degree in statistics. I have had several courses in statistics, mathematics and AI/ML, although I would say my strength lies more in classical ML (taken classes up to elements of statistical learning level) rather than deep learning (although I have built about 5 projects in AI/ML through my classes). However, I do not have strong experience. I have done a quarter of statistical consulting at my school (nothing much, just advising some non statisticians on things like experimental design), worked as Quant research intern at a top financial firm (not quant focused though) and a very very short one month data science internship at another place. I am now graduating. I am aware data science has a lot of roles that require graduates/phds, but most of them have 6 or more years of education, while I have 4. I am looking for an internship that could convert into a full time data science position or a full time out of college.

datascience,"I'm thinking [u/dfphd](https://www.reddit.com/user/dfphd/) could chime in here since he's spoken about the relationship between engineering-DS in the past. 

Here's my particular situation:  

I am a 4th year Civil Engineering undergrad with aspirations for a career in data science. I plan on getting an MSc in CE applying data science techniques to hydrology, which is a fairly data-rich field.

I will be working my last undergrad summer internship this year and I have the following job offers on the table:

**1. Small startup AI company in my home town:**

This position would include tinkering with computer vision systems using opencv/keras as well as some ground-up implementation of CV techniques. The domain (agriculture insurance) is one I'm unfamiliar with, and has little to do with my undergrad (and likely graduate) coursework. 

**2. Well-regarded engineering consulting firm in a \*cool city\*:**

The position is directly related to my field of study, but the amount of data-related work in this position is unknown. The company is at the forefront of statistical hydrology and have many projects applying machine learning to flood forecasting etc., but it's likely that I won't have the opportunity to work on such projects during my internship. The position will likely be more engineering-focused, which will include data analysis to some degree, but probably no machine learning and little programming. 

The obvious choice for me here from an objective standpoint is to take the AI job since it's more directly in line with my career goals. However here are other factors that I'm considering:

* The engineering firm is in a city that I would be very excited to live in, and there is possibility that this internship will lead to a full-time job. I have a strong desire to work out of my hometown after graduation. 
* The engineering firm is also somewhat prestigious in its field, perhaps giving the experience a bit more credibility than that from a start-up. 
* I see a possible progression towards data science work at this company, since other people with CE degrees have switched into data science within the company (after getting MSc's in DS, mind you).  
* &gt;!Working in engineering consulting, even if not directly related to data science, could be valuable experience in my path toward a career in data science. !&lt;

James is a manager at a bank. Here’s some information about him:

I’ve been in IT Consulting (and the same company) for the last 6 years, and I am considering a move to Data Science.

I have learnt **a lot** with my current company: from basic stuff (handling meetings and PowerPoint...) to more advanced things (Team and Project / Program Management, Career Development, Sales, C-Level client relationships etc.)

Coming from a computer science background, I appreciate having grown so much in soft skills, but I feel I miss some of the “hard ones”. I remember this feeling of finally “cracking the code” when you spent hours or days on a program and finally managed to do what you wanted. While you have a bit of that in consulting, it is not exactly the same (*i.e.:* when you manage to synthesize very well the findings of a study, when one of your collaborator finally grew in his role etc.).

Being in IT and loving tech, it was hard to not hear about Data Science every other day.

Out of curiosity, I am following a MOOC on Udemy on Data Science (15h in out of 60h). I like math to some extent, but I take pleasure (and am good) at programming.

For the Data Scientists here with some experience in the field (or not): given my experience and my inclinations, would you recommend to pursue a Career Change in Data Science? The question is not money nor feasibility, but more of a “would I like it” one.
