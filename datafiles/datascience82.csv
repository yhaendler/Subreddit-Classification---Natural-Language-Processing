datascience,[removed],What kind of skills should I be looking for?,1613341960
datascience,"Hello all, I’m currently a sophomore in college. I’ve been working with data science tools for over a year now, mainly python and R and their related ML/data cleaning packages (tidyverse/pandas/sklearn/tf/numpy etc) in various projects of mine and undergrad research.

Long story short, I’ve been applying for internships for the past 8 months and haven’t even gotten an email back from half of them, let alone an interview. I have a feeling that this may because I’m too young and I’m just competing with juniors or seniors for these roles. So I just get auto rejected. 

Anyways, considering the fact that most companies may not be looking for interns anymore, I have accepted the fact that maybe I just need to expand my skill set a bit more, so I’ve decided to tackle another side of data science this summer in self learning data engineering. Specifically I was thinking about doing a udacity nanodegree program or doing certifications to help boost my resume. I was looking at the data engineering nanodegree to be exact.

I thought that this, combined with any projects I do in the summer may make me a better candidate come fall when I’m a junior.

Now my question to any of you hiring managers/recruiters or anyone out there. Is purchasing a certification course or doing these long MOOC courses a good idea? Is it worth the money? Obviously it won’t guarantee me an internship but would it stand out to you in anyway if a student had this? Would I be better off saving my money and just looking through online resources instead of paying for a nanodegree program or a certification program? 

I would like to hear your thoughts on this in general to see what you guys think.",Udacity nanodegrees or certifications even worth it?,1613340020
datascience,"Hello all!  I'm currently transitioning from academia (experimental psychology/neuroscience) to industry and looking to become a data analyst and eventually a data scientist.  Unfortunately, I didn't make as many industry connections in graduate school as I would have liked.  

I have a strong stats background and I'm comfortable in R, less so in Python (I know the basics, but I'm by no means an expert), I know basic Bash/linux command line, and I'm currently learning SQL. I haven't done any DS projects per se, but my graduate work was essentially one long project (pulling data off of servers/web, wrangling it into spreadsheets, cleaning, and analyzing) culminating in several peer-reviewed publications. Really, I'm looking to get my foot in the door and was wondering what you would all recommend to do so? What kind of projects should I take on? Are there any roles that are particularly well suited for a former STEM researcher? I would love to connect with anyone willing to have a conversation and look forward to hearing your feedback.

But, for those who have jobs where what they do at least resembles the ""real"" data science that this sub strives for (i.e. ppl that newbies like me would love to have informational interviews with), I think it'd be cool to gather insights on what various use cases there even are?

datascience," Hi!

I am currently in the process of hearing back from graduate school programs and I wanted to get some advice on decisions. I just finished UG in applied math, and I intend to pursue a PhD in statistics (or possibly computer science) eventually to do statistical/machine learning research. I have applied to a few PhD programs, but have yet to hear back from them. I also applied to MS programs in statistics and have gotten accepted into a few so far. I was fortunate enough to be admitted into the Harvard MS in Data Science program, but I have very mixed feelings about it.

Assuming I don't get into any PhD programs this cycle, I am trying to gain as much research experience as possible to be more competitive in a later cycle. This program has a thesis option so I am quite excited about that, as I would be able to work in a great lab and somewhat closely with exceptional faculty - which I can leverage in rec letters later. I have a significant concern about the program, however:

Although the curriculum is quite flexible, and I would be able to take classes that interest me and perhaps prepare me for a PhD (including those offered at MIT), **it's a degree in data science**, which from what I have gathered - the general sentiment is that such programs are cash cows and are inferior to a training purely in statistics, or purely in computer science.

(Assuming the cost of grad school is not a concern) Is it worth attending this program if I neither get into PhD programs nor other more rigorous/research-oriented stats MS programs, e.g. Duke and UChicago, this cycle?

Thank you for your help!",Is the Harvard MS in Data Science worth it?,1613331242

datascience,"Greetings!

Long time lurker -- I just learned python ~2 months ago (been coding mobile apps for years). Working on a side project and I'm having trouble correctly solving the following problem (which I believe is an optimization problem):

- I'm doing sports analysis and wrote a ""roster optimization"" script
- I run my opponent's roster against all possible combinations against my roster, so I know which roster to choose for the week to beat my opponent
- I have 5 categories I want to optimize. I take the delta between my roster's categories and my opponent's to determine if a roster is good enough to beat my opponent
- My current naive solution is to take the average of those 5 category diffs, and use that as a ""score"". This ""works"", but not really, because of how naive the solution is. If the delta on ONE category is so great, that will skew the ""score"", which is not what I want. I want all five categories to be maximized. I can't just be better than my opponent in ONE category, it needs to be all five categories!

I think my problem can be solved using an optimization algorithm inside of scipy (which I've never used before). The examples are quite complex / I'm not 100% sure which algorithm to use.

datascience,"From [WhatIs.com](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/machine-learning),

&gt;Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that   provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly   programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer   programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to   new data.  
 

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Machine_learning),

datascience,"Vent/rant &amp; moderately long post warning (to a degree):

I'm in my mid thirties, work for a software company coming out of the start up phase, and have been responsible for managing an external consulting team to build our data warehouse and reporting with Tableau. Have a corporate finance background with 10 years experience, adding SQL to the mix back in 2013. I don't know much Tableau other than beginning levels.

In 2021, I made it a point to get us away from using the external consultancy because not only were dev cycles rather slow, they couldn't keep up with the evolving business (we had multiple CEOs in 2020). Because I don't know Tableau and have been an Excel power user, I've opted to begin using Power BI.

Our architecture is built on Fivetran + Snowflake, as well as another (and very expensive) toolset for the transformations in the data warehouse. I want to start using dbt to manage the transformations and forgo Kimball dimensional modeling in favor of wider tables.

All while, I decided to go back to school for CS in 2021, so I'm in an introduction class to CS that relies on Python. Given the corporate finance background, analysis has been second nature to me, whereas development and engineering have not. Prior to corporate finance, I was a math major.

I'm exhausted. I've been working on learning dbt and Power BI, onboarding and onramping a new data analyst, and barely making it by my CS projects. This morning I woke up and realized I have virtually no DS or DE skills, and my DA skills are also in the toilet. It hit me that I'm basically a 2000's business analyst lead (the non-product oriented flavor). 

I recently saw that post that data engineering is outpacing data science jobs, and it makes sense due to the better titling, but I don't even know which space (or reddit) I truly belong in, or how to prepare for the future.

Honestly, I can't see my group using R or Python at all besides setting up API requests that will be basic. We don't touch a bit of ML in my org, and no one would know what it is if you mentioned it. We have a hard enough time performing functions that were considered boilerplate back in the 90's. 

One problem that stresses me out is what I do when I leave this organization and how to prepare for whatever that is. The CS program along with math courses will take 3-4 years to complete, and I'll be 40 when I complete the BS. If I whittle down some of the CS courses to just the core classes while keeping the math, I could be done with the coursework by 38 but no awarded degree. That could set me up for a masters in CS, stats, or math. I could forgo all the CS, take the math, and get into a stats or math program by 37ish. I don't know how to pull off learning the CS stuff, Power BI, and dbt all together. 

I look at jobs on LinkedIn in my area using keywords like analytics, R, python, stats, and CS and it's as expected. The lowest count is stats, followed by R, Python, CS, and analytics in that order. 

Any ideas of what I should do in my situation or which reddit I should ask? I come to DS because I'm closest aligned with analysis than anything, although the kindergarten version.

datascience,"I’m a data scientist at an early-mid stage B2B  startup. Since I joined, all of the data scientists’ roles/scopes have been shifted around a lot (beyond the typical multi-hat wearing). Projects tend to start with excitement from leadership and tend to end with a change of focus from leadership. A lot of change—which I anticipated—but not at this frequency.

I’m a highly experienced full-stack data scientist and I know the value I bring to the table. I thrive working on projects with direct impact to our customers and our revenue. I’m customer-centric and product-lead (I often cold-call customers to better understand their pain points). I fall in love with the problem, not the solution. And I’m a firm believer that perfect is the enemy of good enough. I can be scrappy and resourceful, or I can be methodical and planned. Our data scientists here are high caliber.

However, we say we’re product-lead, but we have no Product leader (our CTO handles product). We say we’re a data company and data-driven, but we have no Data leader.

Some time ago our data scientists were transitioned out of Product and into their own team, and now more recently the team has transitioned into Engineering with the onboarding of a pragmatic VP of Engineering.

My observation is that data projects at this company have been stuck in limbo. The data scientists don’t appear to be (and don’t feel) valued and are usually not asked (or involved in communication) to collaborate where it might be appropriate. I think this is because the overall culture is not data-driven, but HIPPO-driven, leading to short-sighted projects that inevitably dissolve because a new “new and exciting” idea took priority.

The VP of Engineering has a massive data infrastructure project they want to tackle, and as a consequence a number of existing data projects have been temporarily halted—projects and product features that were rooted in solving customer problems and validated in driving value—to “re-resource” data scientists.

I recognize the importance of improving our data infrastructure, and I believe the completion of this task will only open up more capabilities once complete. What I’m failing is grasp is why the company isn’t capitalizing on the data science talent they have to build a stickier and personalized product with *what we have.*

In short, it appears that we’re misappropriating data talent away from important, customer-facing data projects to focus on internal efforts.

Philosophically there are numerous trains of thought on how a team of data scientists ought to be distributed, from decentralization to centralization to pod structures to everywhere in between. Usually this structure is dependent on the size of the company, among other factors.

Given that we claim we’re a product-lead data company, I’d expect we would embed Data into Product and partner closely with Engineering.

I don’t have full visibility into how or why these big decisions are made, so I’d bet I’m missing some key elements. We are in a product-market-fit stage, and I’d imagine that may have influence on the allocation of talent.

I’m confident about this company’s future and I keep a bright outlook for what’s ahead. I see great opportunity and potential for data science work that will drive value. I’m posting here because I want to understand my blind spots and learn if this is typical for data scientists to experience; or, if this is just bizarre.

datascience,"Hi All,

I am currently in a financial leadership development program at a F500 energy company with an opportunity to have a final rotation working in a dual role that is half business analytics and half data science.

I myself have very limited experience in analytics and data science besides some excel vba, SQL and power BI. Data Science is something I have always been interested in and I spend my free time learning. 

I understand I am very raw. Luckily, as I mentioned, the mangers in this role know that and treat the data science piece as a mentorship with special projects.

So please feel free to be blunt here: Going into this role without an CS degree and very little coding experience, am I going to get much out of this? I know normally on the job training teaches you way more than school ever could, but is it way different in the data science realm?

Finally, I ask all of this to find out if this rotation could put me on the track to a career in data science. Or if this position would be something future employers would scoff at as being a tangent from my finance experience instead of a true direction into a career into data science.

* Free hosting through GitHub
* Ability to fork/clone Jekyll templates, while still fully supporting custom HTML/CSS/JS
* Easily write posts in markdown (and it's very easy to convert a Jupyter notebook or R notebook into an md for your site)
* Ability to embed HTML/JS visualizations into your posts (Plotly for example)
* 'Layouts' allow for great modularity, so you can have one 'blog post layout' that all your posts can adhere to (by defining YAML front matter)
* Support for [Jekyll plugins](https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-plugins)

This is definitely not an exhaustive list, and even if you feel your web dev skills are limited, it's really not too difficult to get a pretty data science blog up and running.

Although I know Python (and R) as a data analyst, I'm obviously not a developer. Learning through specific examples has been the easiest way for things to click for me.
