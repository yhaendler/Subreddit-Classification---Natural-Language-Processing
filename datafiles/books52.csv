books,"I'm reading 'It' right now, it's the first Stephen King novel I've ever read. I usually don't read alot of horror since I think it's difficult to do well in written form, but surprisingly King does a pretty great job in that respect. What I'm really struggling with is the character dialogue, particularly with the kids and especially when they're in a group. All of them talk in an unnatural way, characters will say random lines in the middle of conversations, the kids start laughing after every two lines of dialogue. I think he does monologues pretty well and it isn't that bad when two people are talking to each other. Am I crazy here?

books,"This story takes place WWAAYY back in 1994 and in 2002, but I thought you all would get a laugh out of it.

I was a junior in high school at the time and grew up in Orange County where Mr. Koontz lives as well. I'd never run into him but I'd read all of his books and knew that he lived in the area.

Well, one day, in early May, my friends and I were at the beach. They were swimming but I was lying on our blankets reading Mr. Koontz's latest novel when a man approaches me and strikes up a conversation.

M = M SM = Strange Man

SM - ""Hi, I hope I""m not intruding but I see your reading Dean Koontz's newest novel. How are you liking it? I love his books!""

M = (young, naive, and seeing nothing wrong with chatting about books with a stranger on a crowded beach) ""Oh, I'm liking it so far. I've read everything he's written though and I don't think I've disliked a single one!""

SM - ""Really? What would you say was your favorite? I, personally, liked Lightening the best. I found the way he handled time travel really interesting"".

M = ""That's actually my second favorite. My favorite is 'Watchers', I loved the dynamic with Einstein and it had a really 'real world' feel despite being a work of fiction.""

SM - ""Yes, that one was good too. Well, I'll have to give this one a try. Again, I'm sorry for intruding.""

M - ""That's ok, have a nice day!""

He walked off and, as he did I see my friends rushing towards me all excited. They start asking me a million questions about SM and our conversation. I, literally, have no clue why the are so excited about some random conversation with a stranger. Finally, they realize I'm completely lost and tell me to turn over my book. Yep, you got it, I'd been talking to Dean Koontz and hadn't even realized it!!! I guess I just figured that since he's a really famous author from the area it wasn't surprising that someone would stop to talk about his books. I've done that to people before too! Of course I jump and start to run down the boardwalk in the direction he'd wandered off in but, of course, I didn't find him. RATS!

Fast forward to 2002:

My mom calls me from California and tells me she has the biggest surprise for me! She went to a book signing and got me a signed copy of Dean Koontz's newest book, she also said that the signature would really blow me away. However, she would not tell me anything further.

The book comes in the mail, I open it and there's the inscription ""To Kristy, I really enjoyed our conversation on the beach. It was very refreshing. Sincerely, Dean Koontz.""

Mom told me later that, when she reached him, she had told him her daughter was a big fan and that, if he had a moment she had a quick little anecdote for him. She then starts to tell him about my time on the beach but, apparently, he cut her off and said ""Wait, I remember this! That was your daughter?"" My mom was stunned as that had been 8 years ago and she just stared at him and said ""Yes, but how can you possible remember that?"" His response warms my heart to this day. He said ""I remember her because she didn't treat me like anyone special, she just treated me like a regular person and I really loved that!"" Mom then had to burst his bubble and tell him that, in all honesty, the only reason I'd treated him normally was because I'd had no damn idea who he was until AFTER he'd walked away! She told me that he just about died laughing and said that that was story he'd be telling for ages, then he signed me book and Mom walked away. I still have that book, of course.","The Time I Met Dean Koontz But, Kind Of, Didn't!",1600122929
books,"So, some necessary context for this: I'm in a Literary Studies PhD program, and last week I took my comprehensive exams. While I won't know for a few days longer whether I passed or not (crossing every finger over here), one thing I already know is that I'll likely never go through a period of such intense reading in my life as I did this summer. It was both exhausting and rewarding, and that kind of reading experience is worth an entirely separate thread in its own right.

Anyway, one of my three reading lists was focused exclusively on Cormac McCarthy. I had previously read four of his novels, but over the course of the summer I read everything he's written - and I mean *everything*. All ten novels, the four dramatic works, the handful of early short stories that are still readily available, the tiny handful of public intellectual pieces he's done in the past few years with the Santa Fe Institute (this last category is really just one essay, but it counts!). They were all accompanied by a healthy dose of scholarship, both literary criticism specifically about McCarthy and larger historical/theoretical works that could be applied to discussing his books. Now that the dust of comps has settled and I don't have to wear my academic hat for a few days, I thought coming to this sub and writing about it might be enjoyable to y'all (and help me collect my own thoughts, too!). I've kept this post spoiler-free for the benefit of anyone who hasn't read him, but has been considering giving him a go.

**The Good**

Most of McCarthy's novels really are worth your time. The lack of quotation marks around dialogue really threw me for a loop the first time I read him (*The Road*, about ten years ago), but once you get the rhythm of his speakers down, he just sweeps you away. I think he writes some of the best action scenes in fiction - *Blood Meridian* has some absolutely wild gunfights. His work has a pretty deserved reputation for being brutally violent (see ""The Ugly"" below), but *The Orchard Keeper* and *All the Pretty Horses* are pretty tame, so maybe give one of them a go if you're interested but nervous about the darker novels.

Thematically, McCarthy is really into borders, maps, and territorial ownership. I don't want to veer too far into the theoretical weeds (I already wrote that essay for my exams) but there are a lot of really interesting philosophical questions raised in his work about where we ""draw the line,"" both in terms of geopolitical space and personal choice. *The Crossing* is particularly heavy on those sorts of meditations, but it comes up in pretty much everything he writes, probably because most of his protagonists are young vagrants or runaways. Next time you're up a book that you really want to chew on and think through, keep him in mind.

I highly recommend any of *Blood Meridian*, *All the Pretty Horses*, *The Road,* or *The Sunset Limited* (his ""novel in dramatic form"" - a literal dialogue) to anyone who wants to dip their toes in his work. *No Country for Old Men* is also good, but honestly, I think the film makes just the right changes to a couple crucial details and edges it out. If you like *All the Pretty Horses*, then reading the rest of the Border Trilogy (*The Crossing* and *Cities of the Plain*) makes sense, but be aware that each of the three books is very different tonally and *Horses* is easily the most fun adventure in McCarthy's work. *The Orchard Keeper* is his first novel and shows some of that ""debut author"" roughness around the edges, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a first choice, but if you like his other work, it's fun to see the novel that started it all.

**The Bad**

McCarthy isn't even a tenth of the (screen)playwright that he is a novelist. He has four dramatic works - *The Gardener's Son, The Stonemason, The Sunset Limited,* and *The Counselor* \- and only one of them is worth your time. Ironically, that work, *The Sunset Limited,* is written in a pseudo-novel form, so it ends up being a borderline case. I hear the film version of *The Gardener's Son* is good and I meant to watch it this summer, but alas, I ran out of time; reading the screenplay is an exercise in confusion, since McCarthy wrote it while roadtripping with the film's director and didn't need to include important stuff like basic setting description because his co-creator already knew that stuff. I remember liking *The Stonemason* as I read it, but I can't recall a single thing happened as I write this, so clearly it didn't make the impression a good work should. As for *The Counselor* \- well, let's just not.

Some of his common tropes and concerns do show their age. As I was reading and occasionally chiming in to my partner about things, she'd sometimes ask, ""So, has a woman shown up yet?"" If you're looking for books with strong female characters or are really tired of reading American men wax poetic about masculinity, then McCarthy almost certainly will not pass muster in your eyes. Several of his books are virtually womanless, only one of them has a female protagonist (the infuriatingly naive Rinthy Holme of his second novel, *Outer Dark*), and he commits a few pretty egregious fridgings. Similarly, some of the later works - *No Country* and *The Road*, in particular - are really, *really* heavy with the hand-wringing about getting older and seeing the country fall apart, which can come off as an old man grousing about the kids on his lawn. For my part, neither of these ruined the experience for me, but I recognize that they might not sit well with other folks.

Also, I really, *really* cannot recommend *Suttree*, his fourth novel, for any reason. It's an overstuffed exercise in bad scenic prose poetry - mostly of scenes describing how badly polluted the Tennessee River was in Knoxville in the 1950s. Perhaps it was a casualty of the reading context, since I didn't really have the time to luxuriate in its big poetic passages, but considering the subject matter of those passages, I'm not sure it would've been a pleasant experience.

**The Ugly**

McCarthy has more than earned his reputation as a writer of terrible violence, and that can be pretty stomach churning for folks that don't have the tolerance for it. *Blood Meridian* is easily the most violent, but *The Road* can get pretty hairy, too.

And then, there's *Outer Dark* and *Child of God*.

I want to recommend *Child of God* to you, I really do, and I was skeptical going into *Outer Dark* because I've tried to read it before and failed a few times, but in the end, I actually liked it more than I expected. But, here's the thing with both of them: They're not just violent, they're *gross*. Both detail pretty upsetting sexual crimes, there's a lot of bodily functions on the page (*Child of God* spends a whole early paragraph describing its main character pooping), and the protagonists of both books are almost impossibly dense caricatures of Southern and Appalachian redneck/hick stereotypes. I have a really high threshold for the Southern Gothic exaggeration of things, and even I found a few scenes in each book to be...a lot. Of all his books, these are the two that pose the greatest challenge to the reader's taste. Definitely don't pick them up lightly.

books,I read a book back in elementary school and it was really my introduction to enjoying reading as I was an undiagnosed dyslexic and reading at that age was a struggle. It was a shorter book probably only a 100 pages or so. It was about three siblings that had to fly alone (I forget the reason their mom couldn’t come with them) and the plane started going down and the three siblings kind of woke up in this alternate world. Crows would follow them and signal when something bad was about to happen. The youngest sibling kept dimes taped to the inside of her shoe. (Spoiler alert) At the end we find out that the plane they were on crashed in a field and these kids were unconscious but the only survivors. It’s left unclear if the alternate world was a shared dream between the siblings as they all remember it or some sort of place in between life and death.

books,"Thinking on the fuss that people are making about J.K.Rowling, I'm reminded of my mother. As a freelance writer, she once was asked to write an EFL book to explain the Gulf War (the first one) to children. She did.

She was forced to change the book so that the relevant passage read, in part, ""Some oil was spilled during the conflict."" This, she was told, was to ensure that the publishing house's Middle Eastern partners would be able to sell the book to local schools and to the parents of young children.

\*\*Keep The Aspidistria Flying\*\*: easily one of his funniest books, it's a phenomenal satirical novel of a man living in 1930s Britain who attempts to eschew material goods. If you like Joseph Heller, this is a must read.

**Q: Hello. Why did you do this?** 

**A:** Because I had some things I wanted to say. Ideas and stuff. But you can’t just say your ideas, so I did stories with my ideas secretly lurking inside them. Hopefully, it was not too sneaky of me to do this. I promise they’re real stories. It’s just that some of my ideas are also secretly present, and everybody who reads the book will need to deal with that. I’m trying to be more assertive.

**A:** Yes. Not good pictures, but there are 1,678 of them. 

**Q: What are the pictures of?** 

**A:** I don’t like being this confrontational, but I’m not going to describe all of the pictures. That’s why they’re pictures. So I don’t have to describe them. 

**Q: But how will people know what to expect if you don’t describe the pictures?** 

**A:** They just have to trust me. 

**Q: They can trust you?** 

**A:**Yeah. 

**Q: Can you at least tell them a few things that are in the pictures? Like maybe put a list of objects, or say what the average picture is of, or maybe what kind of picture the book would be if it was a picture?** 

**A:** Lamp, dog, sun, walls, mom, dad, potato, uni- verse, tragedy + comedy = time, ants (&lt;—ed note: no ants are depicted in the book), sun, time, two balloons, mom, cat, bag, computer, face, face, face, face, face, mistake, the government (&lt;—ed note: the government is also not directly depicted in the book), man, sand, bird, ideas, stereo.

books,"I always used to love reading as a kid. As I’ve gotten older it’s something I almost never do. At the start of the pandemic I was resolute in starting to reading again. One of my goals was to read classic literature that I probably should’ve read a long time ago. My first stop was Crime and Punishment and I’m ashamed it’s taken me this long. 

This is one of the best books I’ve ever read in my entire life. I found myself wanting to give up on it during Part 1 and Part 2. The internal dialogue sometimes felt like it would go on forever. I would occasionally feel that we were taking a look into the lives of other characters that were just “fluff”. The more I stuck with it the more I realized it was not the case. Every character had a unique and important purpose that either served the main character, or the moral/philosophical takeaways.

Raskilinikov’s mental state is such a key aspect of the book. It’s a constant battle of anxiety and depression yet his actual crime fits neatly between the two of them. 

By the end I absolutely loved every single character. They all had depth and purpose. Raskilinikov’s gloom and melancholy became my own, but so did his hope for the future.

Here are some of the notes I took. Mostly quotes I liked. Either for their philosophical implications or how it relates to the current state of the world. 


Part 1
Chapter 1 &gt; Page 6
“And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head? What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!— and for a whole month I’ve been...” But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation.

As humans, I think we all have had thoughts at one time or another that match up to the feelings this quote embodies.

Chapter 1 &gt; Page 6
“All that’s nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there is nothing in it all to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. Just a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread— and in one moment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all is!”

Chapter 2 &gt; Page 9
I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink... I drink so that I may suffer twice as much!”

This represents feelings towards drugs and alcohol that people may not understand. They use to feel different, but may end up feeling twice as bad as they did before.

Chapter 2 &gt; Page 12
Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been sweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all things, He is the One, He too is the judge.

Chapter 4 &gt; Page 23
”accept one’s lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in oneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!”

While I think we should all strive to be better, to have more things that comfort us, we should still be able to be comfortable with who we are at any time in life.

Chapter 6 &gt; Page 32
A strange idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very much absorbed him.

Chapter 6 &gt; Page 34
He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring, with his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such strange day-dreams;

I saved this quote because it speaks to me and personal anxiety I’ve dealt with.

Chapter 6 &gt; Page 35
Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he could not find rational objections in himself.

Chapter 6 &gt; Page 35
It was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease, developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the individual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.

Part 2
Chapter 5 &gt; Page 73
‘Catch several hares and you won’t catch one.’ Science now tells us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on self-interest.

This is representative of the foundation of American morals. The next quote explains it’s benefit to society.

Chapter 5 &gt; Page 73
Economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in society—the more whole coats, so to say—the firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare organised too.

I love this because it reminds me of the greatness of America. If everyone focused on themselves to the point that you are a better person, we will live in a better society.

Part 3
Chapter 1 &gt; Page 99
That’s man’s one privilege over all creation. Through error you come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and fourteen.

We all make mistakes. This is also a core tenet of Christianity. As an Orthodox Christian I felt a profound connection to a lot of the theological themes in the book despite the somewhat obvious Atheism of Raskilinikov.

Chapter 5 &gt; Page 125
They don’t recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker than any living process! That’s why they instinctively dislike history, ‘nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,’ and they explain it all as stupidity! That’s why they so dislike the living process of life; they don’t want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul won’t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and won’t revolt!

Chapter 5 &gt; Page 126
“In his article all men are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’ Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because, don’t you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they are extraordinary.

Part 5
Chapter 1 &gt; Page 180
“What do you mean by ‘more honourable’? I don’t understand such expressions to describe human activity. ‘More honourable,’‘nobler’—all those are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is of use to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: useful! You can snigger as much as you like, but that’s so!”

In these times I felt this quote to be quite poignant. Especially as we make decisions that determine whether people are essential or not.

Part 6
Chapter 2 &gt; Page 218
a hundred suspicions don’t make a proof,

What more needs to be said about this? It’s such a simple nugget that in and of itself is amazing.

Chapter 4 &gt; Page 229
Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery.

Once again a simple nugget of truth that speaks to the human condition. 

Chapter 5 &gt; Page 233
But if you are convinced that one mustn’t listen at doors, but one may murder old women at one’s pleasure, you’d better be off to America and make haste. Run, young man! There may still be time. I’m speaking sincerely. Haven’t you the money? I’ll give you the fare.”

I love this as a commentary on the morals of America.

Chapter 7 &gt; Page 249
The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence.

This is another simple nugget of truth that speaks to the human condition. We are so concerned with how others view us that it can be paralyzing.",Crime &amp; Punishment (my thoughts),1600106279

But I've been catching up with reading stuff by Annie Jacobson and she's becoming my new favorite non-fiction author. I finished Surprise Kill Vanish last month and working on The Pentagon's Brain right now. The experience or reading her stuff has been good so far. The neutral but necessary perspectives she takes on declassified military history of the united states is one I might not have sought out if I wasn't reading her books.

books,"Sarah Vaughn is a wonderful writer and fiction should have great freedom in plot drivers, but it feels intentionally harmful when you use a mental condition that is under remedied and over vilified and then ghost it.
My reaction was the same as it would be if a character was portrayed as having Autism and all the challenges and then the ending is ""it was actually a virus and it's over"". You devalue the person, the struggle; and take away hope that there is an endurable outcome.
This heart my heart.
Most people who have issues with parenting boundaries are repeating the conditions they experienced and have deep emotional roots beyond right and wrong.

books,I bought this book because of how interesting it looked. It also looked like Sherlock Holmes Red tower which I liked. I finished this book and I have to say It was quite disappointing. A book was way longer then it was suppose to be. The story was really slow which that was another problem I had. Harry Potter is like the same page length but harry potter makes the story more fast paste. Its a mystery book but I didn't feel suspense. I found the characters in this book bland and forgettable. I think this books cover is really good. This book isn't underrated neither overrated. I recommenced Sherlock Holmes Red tower over this book. From a rating scale from 1-10 i would give this book a 3/10 In sorry I just didn't like this book. It was boring with bland characters.,Sherlock Holmes The thinking machine review,1600099774

books,"I picked it up at my local thrift shop for 1€ and have read it over the past month and a half as my first Tom Clancy book because it was the only one available at that moment. After having heard quite a lot of negative reviews I decided to give my own thoughts in.

First of all, it is a good book, I seriously like the plot and how the parts are distributed. The problems I have with it, however, are firstly, that the 200 pages or so at the beginning or so are basically just a way too long introduction to the story and could have easily been condensed to about 50%, the second problem is the fact that so many subplots are added in, which while actually adding to the story or even being essential to it could also be condensed to about 50%. As the last point, I really like the last 100 pages and Tom Clancy's Writing style, they redeem the book of its aforementioned flaws.

All in all, it's a solid book but it could have been far better if all the unnecessary ramble had been cut out. In my opinion, the book really should be only around 400 pages long. I still rate the book at a solid 7/10 despite its flaws.

Since I at least really liked the ending of the book and have heard that the rest of his books are only better, I have since bought a few others of his books from the same thrift shop and starting with ""The Hunt for Red October"" which I've only heard positive reviews of, I'll see how those are.","I just read ""Red Rabbit"" by Tom Clancy",1600093145
