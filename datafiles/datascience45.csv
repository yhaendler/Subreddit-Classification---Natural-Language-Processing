datascience,"Hey team,

So I'm in the middle of my job search after completing my year at FlatIron. I'm not picky on the roles as long as I can do analytics of some kind and I'll get a salary on par with what I make now. That being said, one of the things they ask you to look for in a job search is to post blog posts often and to code every day.

These are good requirements, but my current position is 50+ hours a week, so it's not easy for me to budget time outside of work for this task. However, finding a little time here and there at work is pretty doable, even if I cut my lunch by half an hour.

That being said, I've been using my laptop to remotely log in to my desktop, and then basically doing exercises or making progress that way. I'm wondering if there's a virtual notebook platform that will work with/from git so that I can use familiar tools and packages, and also post to/work from a git repository.

Also, one that's customizable would be helpful, too - my current niche interest is geospatial analysis).",Virtual notebooks w/ local or git file access?,1597013601

datascience,"I am currently reading a book called ""Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow""(very good and highly recommended). In one of the chapter, the author emphasizes the importance of setting aside a static test data set(not the validation set) and should never access it until the final performance estimation of your machine learning system. He wrote and I quote ""generating test set dynamically is not perfect. If you run the program again, it will generate a different test set! Over time, you (or your Machine Learning algorithms) will get to see the whole dataset, which is what you want to avoid. "" I understand the rationale of testing the algorithm on unseen data, but I don't quite see the problem of generating the test dynamically. My argument is that as long as I make sure there is no overlap between the training set and the test set every time I train my model, dynamically generating training and test set shouldn't be a problem because the model is trained from scratch every time and there is no memory taking over from the last version of the model.

datascience,"Hey there!

I'm a Data Scientist/Product Analyst in the mobile gaming company. Recently I've got an idea to distil my experience and knowledge into a book. That will be a hands-on guide on Product Analytics and Data Science. Although my main area of expertise is mobile games, many concepts will work for any mobile apps. They also should be useful for anyone who wants to grow digital products using data.

Here's the high-level outline I have in my mind:  
- Preface 
- What is Product Analytics?
- Data Flow and Tracking
- Metrics and KPI
- Cohort Analysis
- User Segmentation
- Customer Lifetime Value
- Experimentation
- LiveOps Analytics
- Churn Prediction
- Uplift Modeling

I will create an artificial database (or completely anonymised real-world data) and make a SQL + Python tutorials for each topic that requires it. A reader will be able to understand each topic, do analysis and build a model.

I'm now on ""Metrics and KPI"" chapter and things have been going well so far. However, I have some uncertainty in understanding whether anyone needs it at all. So maybe asking the community is a good idea.

- Do you need a book like this?
- What would you like to see in this book? 
- Who do you think is the audience? (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- Should it be a book / course / series of blog posts?

datascience,"The primary languages for analysts and data science are R and Python, but there are a number of ""no code"" tools such as RapidMiner, BigML and some other (primarily ETL) tools which expand into the ""data science"" feature set.

As an engineer with a good background in computer science, I've always seen these tools as a bad influencer in the industry. I have also spent countless hours arguing against them. 

Primarily because they do not scale properly, are not maintainable, limit your hiring pool and eventually you will still need to write *some* code for the truly custom approaches.

Also unfortunately, there is a small sector of data scientists who only operate within that tool set. These data scientists tend not to have a deep understanding.

However it feels like these tools are getting stronger and stronger as time passes. And I am recently considering ""if you can't beat them, join them"", avoiding hours of fighting off management, and instead focusing on how to seek the best possible implementation.

So my questions are:
* Do you use no code DS tools in your job? Do you like them? What is the benefit over R/Python? Do you think the proliferation of these tools is good or bad?

datascience,"Hi everyone! 

I'm currently a data analyst and am having a very difficult time in providing insights of any value. I currently analyze the effectiveness of a company x's advertising on Facebook. Normally, I would use Excel or SQL to analyze the data. However, I've been realizing that a lot of my insights are basic generalizations, like creating regression lines, finding which ad performed the best, which ad had the worst and best ROI, and the likes. Now, I wish to provide something related to statistics so that I'm able to bring better insights.

While studying statistics, my understanding is that a lot of tools like standard deviations, t-scores, z-scores, and so on require a dataset to be normally distributed. However, let's say I was analyzing the amount of clicks one advertisement received over the course of the year. The data has a very heavy right-skew due to the very high number of days the advertisement received ZERO clicks. 

What would be the best course to statistically analyze this data set? If I wanted to understand standard deviation, I know to transform it, since the SD of a skewed data doesn't say much. So, skewed, the SD is 3000. However, if I do a log +0.5, the SD is 3. If I apply the exp to it, then it's 25. Is this the right way to find SD on a right-skewed graph?

What else could I do so that I can start discovering cool things? I guess I lack the experience and guidance at my current company.

datascience,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to create a predictive model that attempts to predict the likelihood of a product converting.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed that in creating models A and B, model B really outperforms model A using various performance metrics (such as MSE, R\^2). However, in practice, model A performs better in predicting behavior.

This really surprised me. When I looked at the differences in predictions, it seems that while in terms of pure prediction power model B is in fact better (getting the probability of conversion right), it tends to make more mistakes for large value items than model A. So its wins are offset by its losses.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to me that I need to factor in the value of the product into the model as well. I'm not sure how to do that. Or perhaps modify the error function to use the value.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

datascience,"Hi, my problem at hand is a binary classification problem in the healthcare sector. I need to predict whether an order will be stockout or not. As for features, I have the date of order, the product ordered and some other information relative to the product (price, quantity ordered, etc.).

E.g. : 

|Product ID|Date of order|Quantity ordered|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1111|2014-01-01|1.0|

From my EDA, I have seen that the month the order was made can have an influence on the stockout.

As I'm doing my data split, I'm wondering if I should do backtesting for the test set, i.e, hold out some future data (so the last years worth of around 20% of my dataset) to evaluate on or if I'm better having an equal representation of each year in each split.  Since it's not a problem like stock prediction (financially) where future values depend on past values, I am unsure if having an equal representation of each year in the splits would leak to data leakage.

datascience,"Hey guys! Hopefully this post is relevant to this sub, not sure why it got taken down earlier. I'm currently a software engineer and I've been thinking of switching to data science for some time now, but after doing tons of research I still can't figure out exactly what skillset one would need to be a good data scientist, and *exactly* what data scientists need to do on a day to day basis in terms of coding/bugs/problems. Although I enjoy coding, there are some things about being a software engineer I definitely don't enjoy, and I have it in my head that switching to data science will fix all my problems and kinda be the best of both world, in terms of doing the things I enjoy as well as getting rid of the things I do not enjoy about my current job. Hoping you guys can give some insight.

Cons IMO about software engineering:

1. Having to be available outside of work. My company doesn't exactly have the best processes in place, and we don't have pushing out code automated yet, so my boss is stuck waking up at 2am every 3 weeks to manually push out the code. Since he's leaving soon, I'll most likely have to help do that as well. In addition, I currently have to leave my phone on those nights to respond to/fix bugs if there are serious issues. I want a job where I can work reasonable hours (about 40 hours a week) and don't need to take my work home with me
2. Bugs! My team is relatively small, and although we do have a few QA people, they don't catch everything. I get such bad anxiety every time it's a release day, wondering if I'll have to wake up to a bunch of issues with my code not working or breaking existing things for our customers.
3. DevOps. I have the type of roll where I need to do a little of everything, including some devops types of tasks. That stuff kinda bores me tbh

I have it in my head that data science will kinda be the best of both worlds, where I can use the skills I have/love (problem solving, logic, analytical thinking, math) but without the things I don't exactly love. Do data scientists need to worry about any of things mentioned above? If so, how, or what other problems come along with the job?

tldr; thinking of switching to data science, but have unrealistic expectations about how glamorous the job is, do data scientists generally have to worry about dealing with issues outside of work hours, fixing last minute emergency bugs, or DevOps type tasks?",What are the negatives about the job?

I have come across examples of topic modelling for data with only one source/channel (e.g. review comments from just the end-users) using techniques such as TF-IDF and LDA. However, in my situation, there are two channels with a back-and-forth happening between the caller and the agent.

The thing is: doing a kaggel with linear regression or neuronetworks seems to me, be far away from master something...

TLTR: Should I just focus on python, master python, interact with some tools let's say django, flask, etc. And just before in my spare time, fully master algorithms and try to switch areas?
I also saw that the best way to analytics is to master SQL, do some reports and build from there to data science... What your view?
