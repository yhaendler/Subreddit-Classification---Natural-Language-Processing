If you saw a project on a new grads resume which is basically a song recommendation system for Spotify, would you think its a good project or bad one? I only ask as I see many projects with the same premise and I want to know if its been done to death already.

I'm really interested in the project but I don't have time as I have to start preparing for job interviews soon and I don't want to waste time doing a project which won't help me get an interview. Any thoughts and advice on what projects I can do to stand out as a new grad entering the industry will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",Bother with a Spotify Song Recommendation project?,1621036619

datascience,"Hi, I hope everyone is doing well in these testing times! 

I am an Electronics and Communications engineer and have been working as a data analyst for the past 3 years. Most of my work also entails predictive models like XGBoost and recently I have also picked up some NLP. 

Now I am looking to apply for a Masters degree. I feel that there are other MS in CS vs MS in DS reddit posts out there but my confusion is a bit more deep, so I'll try my best to structure it well. 

1. I do not have a background in CS, most of the folks I've seen do well in Data Science (Analytics or ML Engineer) usually have a bachelor's in CS. So should I do a MS in CS. 

2. Almost everyone with a MS in Data Science is able to get a job as a data scientist. So I should apply to MS in DS, but it'll blow away my cover for Software Engineering roles which I would not like but are a good backup in the long run. 

3. Since most software Devs or data scientists will be in management positions later on in their career, it does not matter that I don't have backup software engineer roles because I will be a manager.

4. MS DS programs are few in number and my overall profile is not that good to get into great programs. My background is not in CS so it also limits my options for MS CS. 

5. I applied to a mix of MSCS and MSDS programs this year and got into UT Dallas MSCS and USFCA MSDS. I am considering building a stronger profile and applying again but only in either MSCS or MSDS. 

As you can see I'm using a lot of variables to think about this. I am probably overthinking, yes. But I seriously want to make a good decision. 

I would really appreciate perspectives that would help me think and opinions that don't digress a lot from the mentioned points.

datascience,"A client produces 6-12 spreadsheets each quarter.

They have an excel guru put together a big document that visualizes the data. The document contains things like bar charts and descriptive statistics.

I would like to prepare a dashboard that is hosted online or could be shared (via email or cloud) as a standalone application.

The application should be able to accept the data sets as input (ideally, with a drag-and-drop graphical interface), COMBINE the data sets behind the scenes, and produce the necessary data viz.

Goal is to automate the data viz process, and the mechanics should be straightforward since the data sets have the same structure from year to year.

CHALLENGES:
• The data sets are company sensitive. I cannot host a web application on any old web server. I need some contractual guarantee the data isn’t being spied on. My understanding is that most companies have freedom to intercept online info. Maybe then I don’t host the application online at all?
• Client has restrictions on what kind of software they can install. I may be able to install PowerBI or Tableau on my system, but client may not be able.

I am aware that Tableau can easily visualize data from multiple sources. I.e. it would be simple for ME to organize the spreadsheets, visualize key metrics, and host it online. What I would like is a freestanding application where the CLIENT drags and drops the spreadsheets and an application spits out some visuals.

Perhaps this is just because I basically always use GLMs and tree-based methods, but in my experience the vast majority of models will do just fine on highly imbalanced data. Does anyone else find that to be the case too?

datascience,"In the past few years, I finished school with a statistics degree (bachelor), taught myself programming (Python, R, shell scripting), built portfolio on data analysis, data visualization and statistical analysis, worked as a programmer/math assistant at a lab for about a year during school, worked as a data analyst intern for about 4-5 months towards end of school and now working as a quantitative analyst for a government organization a little over a year (my ""first real job"" after graduation). Recently, I've been focusing on applying jobs at tech companies and reaching out to people (including recruiters) on LinkedIn for networking. For most of the application, I wrote a tailored cover letter and cv (one page summarizing my work exp - about 3 years in total - as well as 3-4 personal projects) and reached out to people who work at those companies for insights. I've been doing everything I could to improve my chances of getting interviews, but was not successful (I've gotten only one phone interview recently but was rejected for a data analyst role because I was less experienced compared to other candidates).

I've been feeling depressed at my current work. I find myself restricted from doing more data science-related projects due to bureaucracy and office politics. I like taking initiatives and going out my way to improve things (like inefficiencies in data transfer, analysis, etc.) but noticed that colleagues are tech-averse and hate changes (even if it provides more efficiency), which doesn't offer a lot of learning/growing opportunities - everything that I stand against - and I don't see myself being at this company long-term. I have a strong interest in ecommerce and have been applying to companies (big and small/startup) related to it but I feel that recruiters may be biased against my non-engineering degree, the fact that I don't have 4 co-op internships and that I work at a government (I've been told by someone who works as a recruiter at a very well known ecommerce company that when they see someone working at gov't, they just throw out their cv). 

I spend most of my evenings after work applying to jobs, networking online, learning new data science skills, and working on personal projects (currently working on a raspberry pi project with motion sensor and camera so that I can detect this outdoors kitty in my neighbourhood using machine learning - image recognition with CNN - and send mobile notification so I can pet kitty everyday). I think I'm doing everything I can but not seeing much progress. I'm starting to wonder if there's something that I'm not doing enough or if I should go back to school with co-op option or do some bootcamp with a job guarantee just so I get my foot in the door and have a better chance transitioning into a tech company. Any advice?

Also, I'm not necessarily looking for ""you should try Udemy/Coursera/\[insert some bootcamp for beginners\]"" unless you have a fantastic recommendation - I am already using DataCamp for learning. If you have similar experiences as me or is someone working as a senior/recruiter hiring for data-related roles and can give an honest opinion of how I can make my application stronger, I'd appreciate it :) Cheers",HELP!- I work at a Government.

This dataset essentially describes the rooftop solar potential for different regions, based on Google's analysis of Google Maps data to find rooftops where solar would work, and aggregate those into region-wide statistics.

It comes in a couple of aggregation flavors - by census tract ( https://gourdian.net/g/eric/sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_censustract#summary ), where the region name is the census tract id, and by postal code ( https://gourdian.net/g/eric/sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code#summary ), where the name is the postal code. Each also contains latitude/longitude bounding boxes and averages, so that you can download based on that, and you should be able to do custom larger aggregations using those, if you'd like.

This dataset seems like it'd be interesting to cross reference with things like weather, and perhaps electricity prices, to find the best places for people to invest in rooftop solar.

I am UK graduate hoping to enter the field of Data Analytics.

I received my BA in pure Mathematics and am halfway through an MSc. in Data Science at a university in the US with a relatively new program (~5 years old). I’m just finishing an internship with one of the largest software companies in the world where I worked with a title of data analyst. The company decided not to keep me on afterwards, which is fine, but a bit disappointing. 

I applied to a position somewhat local to me at a hospital as a data analyst and was just offered a job! To be honest, I’m pretty burnt out with school and ready to go part time with that and work while building skills. The hospital is starting a brand new data analytics team which it has never had before and expanding their staff from two data analysts who worked under a separate department, to 9! I have been selected to be part of this team. I’m wondering if this is a solid move and to get some feedback on how it might be working as an analyst at a hospital like this? I know they have major ambitions for this team and what they want us to do. 

I was also hoping to get some feedback on the salary they’re offering me, which is $58k US.

datascience,"Hello all!

Let me start by saying I've been relentlessly Googling for the past few days to find a good answer to this question and have found related, albeit tangential solutions.

Here's my question: I have a large public health dataset (~ 500k rows) that I'm analyzing in R studio and have found through eda that an outcome variable that I'm interested in regressing on a handful of predictors is missing roughly 40% of the data. My first inclination was to use complete cases, but given that the question was related to mental health, a potentially sensitive subject, I suspected that there would be a systematic response bias. So I created some plots to investigate and sure enough, the percentage of missing data for this variable seems to vary systematically across levels of age, sex, and income suggesting that individuals who are more affluent, male, Caucasian, etc. are less likely to respond.

So...given this information, how can I replace these missing data? For instance, if I model the missing data using the demographic variables (age, sex, income) I mentioned (e.g., train a regression model on the complete cases and use it to predict the missing data) would I then be double dipping if I include those same predictors in a subsequent analysis with the updated data set?

I apologize if this question has been covered elsewhere or if I'm overlooking a simple solution and I appreciate your patience and feedback.  

Hopefully I've explained this clearly, but feel free to let me know if I haven't or if you need more info.
