Between being autistic and school ruining my love for books it's been hard to push myself...but this book was genuinely quite thrilling for me, it kept me wanting to read at least one chapter a night(mostly) until today I read the last four and finished it a happy man.


Now for the book itself, as said in the title this will be spoiler free, you could take it as a recommendation too I guess. Everything I'll say is basically whatever you would see on the back of the book and talk of the general nature of the characters and story process.
  
  
------  
  



As the first book in David Gemmell's Drenai series Legend is a great start. It's easy to read and understand while still being engaging and if offers quite a large cast of compelling characters.  

It was recommended to me a couple of years ago after I asked for books that have a similar feel to them as the Castlevania anime, I love stories that are say 90% normal real life kind of stuff and 10% weird, sci-fi or fantastical. Something that feels like it's in a realistic world but just has that slight extra bit of flavour.

Legend has an excellent blend of this, it's mostly a medieval style story about a siege on a colossal fortress in the mountains but there are some light elements of magic to it as well, it's a lot like the Lord of the Rings movies in that way, magic is important and relevant to the plot but not something that drives the narrative, which makes it all the more exciting whenever it does appear. The combat is man to man and military strategy with fantastical elements merely supplementing that.


The main bulk of the story surrounds the siege of Dros Delnoch and the characters within, how they handle the defence, combat itself, the concept of their own doom and death in general. With only tens of thousands of warriors facing something in the realms of a million enemies it's a pretty hopeless affair and the book carries that tone incredibly well. You can pick up some foreshadowing for certain events but it's hard to tell what way it's going to swing, will they succeed or will they all die? And if they do win...what will be left?   

There is magic here but there are no wizards calling down meteors to save the day, it's a classic underdog story. It's kind of like if 300 took place in Minas Tirith, a bunch of characters taking on a horde. Simple but thrilling.
 
  
-----  
  
  
There are many characters in the book, some who show up more than others but they all leave their own impression, most characters seem to have a different outlook on the events upcoming and they're all changed as those events unfold, it's interesting to see how they're developed and either broken down or built up by war. No two are the same. 

It's an appropriately grim tale without being needlessly depressing or gruesome, it felt very grounded to me, I could feel the mood of the great fortress at all times, sometimes morale is high other times not so much. The emotional side of things is well balanced alongside the combat, it's a story that understands that mere muscle and skill does not make a warrior.

The legendary character whom the book is named after, Druss, is a great one. I won't go too much in to him since the book does anyway but the story and characters within hinge on him a lot and it's well built up why, he's a legendary warrior and despite being the first book it really feels like he has a long history within the Drenai world. He's a tough old horse and it's made very clear why he's survived so long in their world. He leaves quite the impression to everyone in the world and likely the reader as well. Awesome character, how I wish he was in a video game. Vions of Kratos.


For being nearly 40 years old and being quite a typical manly story in a manly world I thought Legend handled female characters fairly well, there aren't many of them sadly but the main one is fun and she actually gets in on the action instead of just being some damsel, I didn't expect that. It's a world that's harsh on women but I didn't find it gratuitous, there's no drawn out scenes of stuff you really don't want to read if you've an aversion to that.
 
-----  
  
In conclusion Legend is something of a simple tale but it was a greatly fun read and has made me eager to read more in general but to definitely dig in to the Drenai series more, despite being about a single conflict within the word there's quite a good bit of world building to hook you. The story has some great characters and moments of tension, it keeps you on your toes not knowing what way things will swing until the very end. Awesome as a singular tale and a superb setup for future stories.

books,"First of all, I don’t read classical literature often, I mostly read non-fiction history followed by a few large fantasy series (WoT, Cosmere, First Law) but my wife reads exclusively the classics and what you might call modern literature. So I read alongside her from time to time so we can connect over the book. 

Reading For Whom the Bell tolls totally blew me away, the characters brooding conviction for me didn’t grow old through exposure but grew deeper. Usually my books take place over a timeline of years but this entire book was over the course of three days and you really start to get to know the characters. 

Robert Jordan. Man I don’t know if everyone thinks this way but he thinks exactly how I do. The way he argues with himself and indulges in the poetry of it. His internal struggle to reject his father, to fight for the cause, to look after Maria is all (for me) believable. 

Hemingway’s intensity I adore, why write at all if you’re not going to write about what is good and pure and true and intense. (Of course there are many reasons to write aside from these). I respect it and it’s a nice antidote to some of the vagueries of life we all experience. 

As for the “thee” and “thou” criticisms I have heard it’s really not that bad and it’s common in European languages to have formal and informal discourse and for me that captures that well and is not jarring. 

I am also quite surprised with the number of 1 star reviews on goodreads. “Most boring protagonist” “too much pining about breasts” “it ended our book club”. It is in the fashion to bag on Hemingway? I don’t know? As i come from massive fantasy where a slog can be 2 books of 1000+ words perhaps my tolerance for pace is off but I found it gripping and well paced with interesting dialogue, no small amount of philosophy to reflect on and at its heart a desperate love affair that I am still affect by.

books,"What the title says. I am conflicted about this to be honest. I did enjoy the fault in our stars, in fact, it used to be one of my all time favorite books. John Green has a couple of ways to create emotions to the readers that are actually really hard to find in authors and that I won't explain here, mainly because I do not know quite how, and because it will take me a long ass time and make me sound like a snob. But all I can say, is that ''metaphor speaks pain better than we do'', or something along the lines that I read in the fault in our stars. It is not even neccecarily about metaphor, but I can not explain it otherwise.

But is John Green really that good? Or am I biased? Did I ignore some major flaws in his writting? It is true that teenagers do not actually behave or speak the way john imagines them. And it might also be kinda true that his characters are underdeveloped and one dimensional, for example, the only thing I remember Hazel as is as a nepotistic cynical teen that somehow speaks like a well studied philosopher/pretentious professor. She did not interest me as a character. Gus on the other hand is not even cynical, he is just that: A kid that speaks like a pretentious professor, and he seems to think a lot for someone who spends excssive time playing videogames and playing basketball, a sport that even he admits to hating. I don't even feel like Gus's relationship with Hazel changed her, even if she and Gus are polar opposites. Hazel is a cynical nepotistic girl who spends escessive time doing nothing and thinking about death and human existence from the prespective of someone who is dying, and Gus spends quite a lot of time thinbking about it while coming to important life changing conclusions about it from the prespective of someone living, or to put it even better, without caring about living or dying, just like someone who is living and has a normal life expectancy does. That did not change Hazel, it did not make her less cynical, less nihilistic it did not even make her accept nihilism as a part of life. It did nothing. Or maybe that is just what I remember.

What do you guys think? Is he a good author? Is he amazing? Is he okay? Is he mediocre? Is he bad? In my honest opinion whichever of these answers is right, John Green has a lot of potential but may be unable to handle it correctly and ruins the future of books that could potentially be amazing if he wanted them to.",Is John Green really that good?,1605810761

What do I say of Camus when I lack words, when reading his diaries is a transformative experience, where he lies there with the likes of Borges, Pessoa, Paz, Gao XingJiang and countless others who I forget in this overwhelming feeling I get while talking about him.

I always say that Camus was not a philosopher. He was an artist. He didn't have the rigour and his theories were flawed, yet he looked into the soul of humanity. He based his convictions in human life because he had seen the loss of it. He refused a Utopia that everyone believed in around him, if it meant him accepting death of his fellow beings. He saw the violence he was made of.

He put forward ideas with a lucidity that bordered at poetry. He made you question yourself before questioning the world. And despite all, he truly believed in giving hope to humanity, to not let us perish in the face of a rationality that was cold and sterile. I could never forgive Sartre for what happened just post the end of these notebooks, the deep melancholy that pervades in the following notebooks, yet I find immense beauty in the fact that history has redeemed Camus.

My name is François Vigneault, I am an American-born cartoonist living in Montréal, and my graphic novel [TITAN just came out from Oni Press](https://onipress.com/collections/all-products/products/titan)!

TITAN first came out a couple years back in [French](https://editionspowpow.com/boutique/titan/), and the [English edition](https://francois-vigneault.com/titan-oni-press/) just landed in a bookstore or comic book shop near you (or your preferred website, for that matter... My fave is [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/books/titan-volume-1-9781620107799/9781620107799) ). 

[TITAN](https://francois-vigneault.com/titan-oni-press/) is a science fiction graphic novel that follows a pair of star-crossed lovers from (literally) different worlds who find themselves caught up in a burgeoning worker revolution on the moon of Titan. Cory Doctorow (Radicalized) called TITAN ""a gripping, knotty, epic tale of exploitation and solidarity"" and Ben H. Winters (Underground Airlines) said ""were TITAN simply a novel, it would be great as a piece of graphic art, with its richly imagined backgrounds and bold character portraiture, it is sublime.” [Quill ＆ Quire](https://quillandquire.com/review/titan/) ran a starred review and said, ""blending elements of political thriller, hard sci-fi dystopia, and classic love story, TITAN is a brisk but rich read,"" and [Publishers' Weekly](https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-62010-779-9) had this to say: ""this blend of indie art and sci-fi social commentary will appeal to fans of the Bitch Planet and Paper Girls series."" The French edition was also nominated for a bunch of awards. Soooo... maybe you'll dig it too! If you wanna take a sneak peek you can [""Look Inside"" the book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1620107791) or download a PDF of the first chapter here.

Like many professional creative-types I wear a lot of hats. In addition to writing and drawing this graphic novel, I've been involved with all kinds of fun stuff connecting to world of books: I draw an award-winning Québecois YA graphic novel series called [13e Avenue](https://www.lapasteque.com/13e-avenue-tome-1), I am the artist on an upcoming monthly comic book series in the USA, I design book covers for a wide range of clients, I ran not [one](https://www.sfzinefest.org/) but [two](https://lineworknw.com/) comic book/zine/illustration festivals, and I work as a comic book letterer (recent projects include books at Drawn &amp; [Quarterly](v) and [NYRB](https://www.nyrb.com/products/letter-to-survivors?variant=53437822983) ), editor, [translator](https://floatingworldcomics.com/shop/comic-books/the-immersion-program-by-leo-quievreux), graphic designer, and more. I have also served on a number of grant juries. So if you have questions about being a freelancer, the world of comics/bande desssinée/graphic novels, or the behind-the-scenes of the publishing industry, shoot!

When I'm not working I like to go camping (my partner and I recently did a camper van conversion), birding, and canoeing (I used to like things like going out to the movies, grabbing a beer with friends, and traveling the world, but... For obvious reasons these days I don't get to pursue those hobbies quite as much). I'm a cinema buff ([Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/FVigneault/) ), an avid reader ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2985070.Fran_ois_Vigneault) ), and music lover, so I'll be happy to chat about all things cultural. I grew up pretty poor, worked all kinds of different jobs my whole life, and ended up going to a fancy liberal arts college (I wrote my undergrad thesis on the comics of Jaime Hernandez). My favorite subreddit is r/whatsthatbook. I grew up on the West Coast of the USA with French-Canadian and Haitian roots, and I have been living in Canada for the last five years (Je parle français aussi, alors n'hesite pas de poser des questions!).


Looking forward to talking with you all!

The story starts with a young man in a castle, he gets assigned a mentor in the castle and throughout the series, this mentor teaches him to fight, hunt, track, and even move quietly through forests. They wore cloaks, and carried daggers, and were very close to the king of the castle and sometimes went as messengers. I wish i could even recall a name, but this is all i have to go off of. I hope someone can help!",Trying to figure out a book of my past! Help please!,1605794193

books,"I've recently fallen in love with reading novellas. A nice bite sized story that has meat on it, but I can still consume in a day. And they're still so interesting and very well written. What are your thoughts on novellas? I personally think they are the future of books. If not fully the future, I think they are perfect jumping off point, or gateway drugs if you will, to get people into longer forms of writing.",Thoughts on novellas?,1605790122

The characters are relatable and beautifully portrayed through their actions. The narration is crisp yet complete, peppered with delicious metaphors. 

I will be reading this one again. Highly recommend.",Just finished A Man Called Ove. Honest and brilliant.,1605789174

books,"I’ve always enjoyed books with a “medicine woman” as a main character. Mixed with my interest of Native American and Mexican culture this book was so touching and engaging.  I believe Bless Me, Ultima is required reading for New Mexico high school students.  Even though I am neither of Native American descent or Catholic I really empathized with Antonio’s struggles for understanding of life. This book is pure magic.  I always look forward to watching the movie with my family after I finish a book I love, the closest thing I can do to share a wonderful story. Happy Reading!","Bless Me, Ultima is so magical",1605788502
books,"Hi,

I was wondering if anyone has noticed the recent quite high price increase on all books? (at least books I have in my wishlist).

Some of my orders were even refunded, saying they can't get the requested title but the title is still available on their website but for almost triple the price now.

As someone living in three countries, I use Bookdepository from the USA/Canada/UK and I have noticed the prices have gone up in all these regions.

I hope this is temporary as BD is my main source of paperbacks. I don't know of any other site offering their books cheaper and with free shipping. I have ordered hundreds of books from there and not a single one was lost or delivered damaged. Can't say the same about Amazon or B&amp;N.",Bookdepository recent price increase,1605787794
books,"I found ""Staring at the Sun"" by Irvin D. Yalom on Amazon, a book about overcoming our fear of death. I feel like it could be a valuable read but I'm apprehensive.  I just don't feel confident that I'm emotionally equipped to handle this kind of material. I've listened to some pretty heavy philosophy before and it made me very depressed and anxious, and I still am to a lesser extent. 

However I wonder if these uncomfortable feelings are just part of the process. It's not that I don't think I can handle the feelings themselves in the moment, but I worry they'll grow larger and more consequential the more I read.

Has anyone here dealt with anything like this? Is it a case of working harder or thinking smarter? Did you just knuckle on through or did you take a more thoughtful approach?",Reading emotionally challenging books,1605786916
