datascience,"Hey all! 

So let's say my training data set has 600 records (already shuffled). Let's assume that I set my batch size to 32 and set the amount of epoch's equal to 10. From my understanding, a standard ML program will do the following (assuming I'm doing a simple y = **m**x + **b** linear regression). 

I will use 32 data points from my training data set to get a value of **m** and **b**. Then the program will loop and get an additional 32 data points from my training data set to get a revised more accurate value of **m** and **b**. This will loop 10 times continuously revising **m** and **b**. 

By the end, this means my data set used 320 total records to train and get the most accurate value of m and b. Now assuming that is correct, I have some follow up  questions: 

1. Does the machine learning algorithm avoid using repeats of data points throughout the process? For example, after the first loop the algorithm will have used 32 data points and not have used 568 data points -- does this mean that the next epoch will randomly select 32 data points from the remaining 568 to make sure you don't re-use data points?
2. Assuming the answer to the question above is correct, what happens if the number of training epoch's and batch size multiplied is greater than the total amount of records in the data set (ex: epoch = 20 &amp; batch size = 32). Does the program not work or does it re-use values from the training set?",Somewhat confused on how batch size and epoch relate -- can someone check my logic?,1607981445

I need your wisdom. I'm working with variational autoencoders to understand them and their applications. But I don't know which loss function apply: MSE or BCE. I have seen people applying MSE, others using BCE... As far as I understand, MSE is used when the latent space embedding vector follows a Gaussian distribution, and BCE is used when the assumption is that that distribution is multinomial.

Is that true or am I terribly wrong?

I do some test with MNIST dataset and I find that if I use MSE, it works so bad, it is not able to replicate the input. But if I use nn.BCELoss(reduction='sum') (PyTorch), it works just decently, does it mean that MNIST dataset is more likely to a multinomial distribution than a normal distribution?

datascience,"Let me preface this by saying I am currently employed as a data scientist, mostly focused on marketing for an online university. I have close to five years' professional experience training and deploying models (along with all the steps that come before and after), building reports and dashboards, presenting to stakeholders, etc.  My problem is, I feel that I've hit a ceiling at my current company. There's not much left for me to learn from those above me, at least in terms of technical skills, and my team keeps getting smaller and smaller with people moving on to greener pastures and the company not willing to hire replacements.

I would really like to get experience working for a larger, more technology-oriented company but my degree did not really prepare me for the types of roles they seem to be hiring for. Usually the job listing will say something like ""bachelors or masters in data science, computer science, mathematics, physics, or other related field."" My masters program was mostly focused on statistical models with some general business knowledge and communication skills mixed in. There was only one class in data science and it was a pretty watered down introduction to some of the most commonly used algorithms. 

I'm working to get up to speed by studying general computer science concepts, some more advanced maths, and struggling to wrap my head around leetcode style challenges. My question is, will self-learning along with my only loosely related degree be enough?
