books,"What does it take for someone to be called a hero? Now, I guess everyone has a different answer for this question, but I would suggest something to you: Voluntarily going to infiltrate Auschwitz, building an underground army there and sending reports out of there, in hopes of provoking the Allies to action. 

Does this sound like a kind of tasteless idea for a World War II fiction novel? Well, it probably would be, if this wasn't a real (as in non-fiction) story of the Polish soldier Witold Pilecki. 

The book takes you on the journey with Witold threw the war and the years after and at times leaves you angry, sad but also hopeful when you look up someone in the ""character"" section at the end of the book and see that he lived until after the war. 

It also helps to bring light on the struggle of the Poles under Nazi occupation; a part of the War that is often forgotten. 

And one learns about the transition of the camp of Auschwitz itself, which is also not an often talked about subject. Of course everyone knows about what happened there in general, but what does anyone feel if he just hears of a million dead? Sure, it is terrible, but also incomprihensable. In so far, it hit me personally harder to read of the first couple hundred gassings there or the senseless deaths of people on gets to know by name. But, I also want to stress that the book doesn't exploit the horror in a cheapo. It states facts and is very well researched (at least I trust it is, as i can't check the hundreds of given source documents) without sacrificing readability. This could very well be some fictional hero's story (albeit with a rather non-traditional character arc and conclusion).  

So I hoper this, probably a little rambling, post could convince some to give this book a try. Excuse my English, I am not a native speaker. I honestly think it should be something everybody, history buff or not, should read and learn about and learn about Witold. For anyone who wants to deep dive, Witold Pilecki's memoirs (""The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery"") are also available in English, though I'd still recommend ""The Volunteer"" for context.",The Volunteer by Jack Fairweather is an amazing book about an unsung hero that everyone should read.,1583363140

Additionally, I see audiences of both men and women at book tours for male memoirs but predominantly women at book tours for female memoirs.

A recent example is “Becoming” by Michelle Obama. While I’m sure some men read it, a male friend remarked to me that he subconsciously labeled it a woman’s book.

Why would a woman be able to relate to a man’s story but not vice versa? What do you think can be done to reduce this sexism within the reading community? Do you even think this is a problem or am I in the minority thinking it’s a problem?

There's a paper entitled ""Representation of social actors in Chinua Achebe’s novel “Things Fall Apart” and its two Persian translations"", which does list five separate translated editions of the book. So, they are definitely out there.

&gt; This novel has been translated  into many languages. It has attracted the attention of Iranian translators as well. Through the years, five translators have translated  it  into  Persian.The  first  translation  of  “Things  Fall  Apart”  was undertaken  by  Farhad Manshoorian  (1989)  [Hame Chiz Foroo Mipashad] (1368 Iranian  calendar);  the  second  one  [Hame Chiz Foroo Mirizad]  by Safavian  in  1999 (1378 Iranian  calendar),  the  third  one  [Hame  Chiz Foroo Mirizad] by  Ali Asghar Bahrami in 2001 (1380  Iranian calendar), the  fourth [Hame Chiz Foroo Mipashad]  by  Kamrava Ebrahimi  in  2012  (1391  Iranian calendar), and the fifth one [Hame Chiz az Ham  Mipashad]  by  Hodavand in 2012 (1391 Iranian calendar).

It even notes the two most popular translations

&gt; Among these five translations, the ones by Farhad Manshoorian (referred to as  T. A., henceforth) and  by Kamrava Ebrahimi (referred to as T. B.) were selected due to their popularity and availability.

I just wish his books weren't aimed to such a young audience. Maybe i'm too used to darker and gory books and yes i'm just expressing my personal taste but... It would help in his character development. For example Vin in Mistborn, \[minor spoiler, literally the first few pages\] Sanderson clearly avoided mentioning rape risk when she's was the gang. I mean come on... The situation was screaming about it and no i'm not at all suggesting he should have included rape in his story. But sexual advances that she can avoid using her ""luck""?  

 Or the way he doesn't like to describe gory fights when they're clearly so, the way he doesn't put cussing words in any of his books (WHICH IS FINE, star wars does the same, i actually love that every story has its own specific terms) but you get what i mean. I just wish they were more adult because i love when a good story can punch me in the gut and make me flinch as long as it's well written and he definitely can write a good story.

I could not find any discussion on this book in the sub and thought I should mention it. Has anyone read it? and as a side question- is there anyone here that grew up in Russia in the 90s/00s willing to share how their experience may have aligned with the novel?

books,"Scouring chapter seems to be hold more popularity among the really diehard fans of Tolkien who think he could do no wrong than the casual readers. I liked what Tolkien was trying to convey: the danger is not ended even after the big evil is defeated, even home is not safe. But I dont feel it was executed well. something about it irks me. Perhaps it's Saruman's cartoonish portrayal or it's the Hobbits cracking jokes like Marvel superheroes, throwing bathos here and there or that it comes up too late in the story for me to give a damn.

books,"Apologies if this isn't quite the place to post this, but it's something that's been on my mind recently. TL;DR at bottom.

As an English major in college, I spend much of my time discussing books with my classes (an experience I'm sure is very analogous to a book club). Nearly every comment by a student, across classes, grades, and backgrounds, is prefaced by the phrase, ""I think it's interesting that.""

One of my first disagreements with this phrase is that it is an example of how people feel they need to justify their contribution. You shouldn't feel afraid to express your opinion, you don't need to have a specific reason to say something. If there's something on your mind, you should say it. Rather than saying, ""I found the conch shell in *Lord of the Flies* interesting because it symbolizes society,"" people should feel confident enough to simply say, as though they were writing an essay, ""The conch shell symbolizes society.""

Two, it leads to discussions that are simply pointing out interesting things without forming opinions on them. Discussions of books in which people simply reminisce about the best parts are a lot of fun, don't get me wrong. But they're not productive. Rather than simply pointing out the symbol of the conch shell, a comment about what that *means* and *why* its important would spark a deeper conversation. 

Three, people use the word interesting without interrogating what makes something interesting. Honestly, just thinking about why one thing is more interesting than another is a fascinating point of discussion. But we toss the word interesting around as though it had a specific definition when it comes to literary criticism when it really doesn't. Saying something like, ""This was interesting to me"" and then delving into the linguistic construction that the author uses to make it interesting could be really cool, and it's such wasted potential. 

Four, it's so repetitive. I've run out of like actual substantive arguments and now I'm just complaining, so you can skip this part. But *everyone* starts their comments like this. Even people who I regard with the highest respect, people who I think are crazy intelligent. And it's always with the same artificial tone of voice, the kind that trails up into a question at the end of a sentence. Be definitive, people!

TL:DR: Saying ""I think it's interesting that..."" leads to less productive discussions and it's infuriating to have to listen to people start their comments this way over and over. 

Haha sorry for the rant, this is such a small thing but it's been increasingly bothering me lately. I don't mean to call people out with this post, I start my comments with ""I think it's interesting..."" unless I consciously decide not too. And honestly, a lot of haha interesting haha comments get made that start with, ""I think it's interesting."" There are better ways to express yourself, and you should never feel the need to justify your contribution to a discussion.","""I think it's interesting that..."" is a poor way to start comments about books.",1583335834
books,"So. I want to make a story because gay book is not much out there and I want to be proud. So... Help. I will tell you guys part of the stories and you guys will choose one. And if I could I will post it here or in wattpad idk. P. S not all part of the book will be about the gym couple. So... 

1. The Phoenix Wrath. 
A girl name Evelyn Harp was living as a lab rat for 6 years for a certain virus. The virus would kill a certain individual, and if you survived. You will be put into a very deep surveillance. She was one of the 2000 people out of hundred thousand they experimented. They succeed and the virus broke out making one of the first time people died as much as the kill count of Hitler domination. 

A certain attacked happen making the scientists have no other choice but to kill every single of of them... Out of 2000 people... There's only 5 survivor. Blah blah, years past and everything. (Sorry I'm a little lazy.) She was adopted and was living her normal life. Until she was attack and her only family was killed right in front of her own eyes. When the virus broke out, there's a certain people who get a power awakening inside of them. 

They have a collar on their neck to stopped them from going crazy. She was framed for her father death and swear to the God until she died she will find them and kill every single one of them. But first she need to find some help from a certain group of people. 

2. Demonic life. 
Ryan Anderson (maybe would change the name) was living under the same roof under his grandfather almost all his life since his parent die at a very early age. But he's grandpa would never let him near the attic. There's a stair up to the attic but it was always locked. 

Everytime he asked his grandfather why, he would ignored him saying something ridiculous or something. But as time passes he seems to forget about the attic. Until his grandfather die, he inherited his whole fortune. Since he own a cafe nearby, he wanted to move in to his grandfather house. That was when he accidentally made a pact with Archduke J. A huge douchebag and a salty son of a bitch bastard. 

He grant Ryan 1 wish. He could choose anything he want, but after the wish is granted. He will take his soul down to hell with him. He never thought about it so he keep the wish and never wished about anything, until he a black monster attacked him in the dead night. ""Oh. Did I forgot to tell you? The longer you make a pact with the devil. The more of the Grim little bastard chasing after you."" 

3. Princess Quest. 
Just like the tittle, this time a princess kingdom was cursed and she was the only survivor. With no other thing then the god words that was bestowed to her. She begin her journey to the dark forest to meet the Dark magician to help him. The problem is? His first companions for this quest is a thief who decided that helping her get to the dark forest is an easy money. 

When she able to find him, ""I need your help—"" He cut her words off. ""No. Find someone else.""

It's a compelling image, but more than that, it seems familiar to me. I'm fairly certain I've seen it before. But I can't remember where. 

Searching Google, Amazon, and Goodreads proved fruitless. None of the books titled ""Masquerade"" seem to be even close. My best guess is that this is a non-US bookstore and that ""Masquerade"" was published under a different title in Western markets. Googling the name of the bookstore (""Book-off"") reveals that it's a major Japanese bookseller, so that seems to bear the theory out.

My next stop was to search Amazon Japan as well as Book Depository, but no luck there, either. So I turn to you.

The only other clue I have to offer is that, if properly alphabetized on the shelf, the author's name is between Kibler and King.
