datascience,"I wish there was a daily or weekly stupid questions wiki as I'm still new to DS and this probably has a simple answer but here goes.

I'm learning to do Bayes modeling in R.  From another post  here I started looking into the rstanarm package. Very neat - but I'm not sure I understand the output.

Isn't the point of Bayes to do probability?  Right now I have a long list of iterations that spit out specific values, almost like a regression.  

I.e. If I'm using Moms IQ to predict Child's IQ and i run it through, I get an actual model with an intercept and slope.  And when I put in new predictions I get a specific point.  

All that to say - isn't the point of Bayes to predict probabilities?  I'm not sure how I'd evaluate the question 'If mom's IQ is 110, what's the likelihood the child's IQ is 110 also?'.  Is it just to sum up the iterations where the IQ is &gt;= 110 also over the total number of iterations?

datascience," 

I am working with the R programming language. Suppose I have a dataset which describes the business relationships between a group of grocery stores and their customers. In this example:

1. Customers can shop at different Grocery Stores
2. ""Grocery Stores"" themselves can shop at other Grocery Stores (i.e. the owners of grocery stores frequently visit other grocery stores to buy products for their own stores)
3. Customers can buy and sell between themselves

The code to generate some sample data looks like this:

    library(igraph) 
    
     my_data &lt;- data.frame(  ""node_a"" = c(""Store_A"", ""Store_A"", ""Store_A"", ""Store_B"", ""Store_B"", ""Store_C"", ""Store_C"", ""Store_C"", ""Store_C"", ""Store_C"", ""Store_B"", ""Store_C"", ""customer_4"", ""customer_9"", ""customer_1""), 
    
    ""node_b"" = c(""customer_1"", ""customer_2"", ""customer_3"", ""customer_3"", ""customer_4"", ""customer_2"", ""customer_5"", ""customer_6"", ""customer_7"", ""Store_B"", ""customer_9"",""customer_9"", ""customer_5"", ""customer_4"", ""customer_1"") )

 From here, I am not sure if the next steps are logical. In normal circumstances, the ""nodes"" in the graph would all be of the same ""type"" - e.g. all the nodes would be ""customers"". In my example, the nodes are either ""customers"" or ""stores"". In my view, on some level this is like ""comparing apples to oranges"" : even though the graph is describing business relationships between customers and stores, a store is significantly different, ""bigger and stronger"" than an individual customer. I am not sure if it makes sense to create a graph in which all the nodes are not homogenous.

Here is the graph that is created - I made the nodes corresponding to ""stores"" significantly larger to display the inherent difference between a ""customer"" vs a ""store"":

    node_size &lt;- data.frame(col = unique(unlist(my_data))) 
    
    node_size$size &lt;- c(""50"",""50"",""50"",""15"",""15"",""15"",""15"",""15"",""15"",""15"",""15"")  
    
    graph &lt;- graph.data.frame(my_data, directed=T) 
    
    graph &lt;- simplify(graph) 
    
     plot(graph, vertex.size = as.numeric(node_size$size))

 [https://imgur.com/a/wyVs0l0](https://imgur.com/a/wyVs0l0)

If this graph makes logical sense, I am then interested in performing clustering (""community detection"") on this graph in order to find interesting sub-networks :

    fc &lt;- fastgreedy.community(graph) 
    plot( fc, graph, vertex.size = as.numeric(node_size$size))

 [https://imgur.com/a/t22DAet](https://imgur.com/a/t22DAet) 

If such a graph can be logically constructed, I hope clustering algorithms (e.g. fastgreedy, louvain, girvan-newman) can be performed on this graph and ""highly connected"" clusters can be identified which can be used to determine which stores/customers are at risk of getting COVID-19.

Can someone please tell me if this idea makes sense : can a graph be constructed where the nodes are not all of the same ""type""? (e.g. a graph being composed of grocery stores and customers vs a graph just being composed of customers)

Recently, we figured that we need to find out which products were ordered frequently with respect to others; products which occur frequently together.

How can I approach this? I have information of each order and the SKUs ordered by that customer. There’re about 300 SKUs and  each one of them have some relationship with the other 299. There’re 1000s of customers and each have 100s of orders. So I do have a decent sized data set 10a of millions of data.

I've worked in sports analytics in associate/internship type roles since 2018 and am now seeking other analyst roles in the ""real world"" that actually pay a living wage. 

My experience has mostly been to do some ad-hoc SQL queries when needed, very basic R visualizations, and then really communicating this information and generating buy-in. The sports industry is tons of travel and tons of juggling how we communicate complex data to an array of zany personalities. But for instance, I've never used SQL everyday. I've never used Python/Java outside of school, etc. I have my toe in the water for a little but of everything, but at very basic proficiency. 

I'm not confident. Even in CompSci - I have a 4.0 in my first three semesters (intro courses), but don't feel like I earned it. They were always project-based, where I had a week to do it and have resources like the text and Stack Overflow at my disposal. But exams always scare me. I have severe anxiety and when I'm on the spot, I blank out. Test scores are always range from 70-85, for the most part. And it's been worse as I transition into CompSci, as I feel like an imposter, like I'm dumb, and all I could ever be is some salesman. I don't know why I feel that way, but I do. 

Anyways, I've been throwing my resume at the wall and have had a few ""real world"" analyst jobs come back to me. I did two preliminary logistical interviews this week and both went well. They both said how they enjoyed speaking to me, and next steps would be more in-depth data technical interviews (one even went as far to say it's not like they'd be whiteboarding me), and after the call, I threw up due to the anxiety. Maybe I'm a fraud. I sure speak a good game, but maybe I'm all bullshit. And then I hate myself. 

This is my first job where I'll be using a set of tools every day. I have my preliminary knowledge, but in my sports jobs, I'd use SQL daily for a week and then not need to touch it for a month. I try to work on my technical skillset, but grad school is demanding and most of my free time goes to the job search. I think I'm a good communicator. The HR rep said some of the job was talking to executives, and I've done that a lot in undergrad case studies in my business foundations work....but that was in 2015. A lot of my jobs have been having a drunk baseball coach call me at 3am to ask for a report to have on his desk by 8. In a lot of ways, I'm a beginner. 

Back to the technical interviews, I feel sick to my stomach. No chance, I have no chance. I've done basic research on questions. For example, ""How many people order pizza a week in America?"" was one. And I froze. Uhhh, I don't know? How many people are in America, what's the budget of each area, what's the quality of pizza and the location (are we near a college or a suburb)....but I can't think of numbers. What if it's an in-depth SQL question, when I really haven't queried a table in two years. And I don't have a lot of experience this past year, having been furloughed 3x. It's like...I'm so close to having a real job with benefits. I'm 25 and have been dirt poor all my life, especially given the rate sports pay ($8-15 an hour). Yet, I can't think on my feet. I work best when I can analyze data at piece. I can meet deadlines, but that I can plan for. I need to plan and know everything or I lose control and spiral into this deep-rooted depression and hatred about how I'm going to embarrass myself in front of some high-level executive, whose time I'm wasting by sitting there with my eyes in the headlights. 

I just feel panic. I feel exposed, like I'm some dumb cheating fraud who can't do this, despite the fact I want to. I feel like the world's biggest fraud. I'm always the last to finish Java assignments and need to do the most external research...and even then I need to ask someone for help. How am I going to pass some technical interview on my feet? I don't know. This is just a rant after, once again, my preliminary interview went great, but I know I'm going to shit my pants with anxiety the second anyone asks for specifics. I don't want to be poor anymore. I'm doing this grad work to make a better life for myself after COVID and my industry ravaged me. And I'm so exhausted from depression, grad work, stress, not sleeping, job applications, no accessibility to healthcare or mental care. I like doing work with data, but have no daily experience. Ugh.

Context: I'm what I consider to be a data analyst. I can observe and analyse trends and patterns in data and visualize/report insights to non-data stakeholders. I'm currently applying for a Data Analyst role at a new company. Have done a couple of interviews so far and have gone well, including a fairly basic SQL technical interview.

I've now got another technical interview which will be a case study based on business questions. I've been sent a list of example case studies that the Analytics dept uses in interviews. The Analytics dept employs Data Analysts *and* Data Scientists. Separate roles who obviously collaborate a fair bit. 

Now, the issue: the example list I've been sent contains some case studies that relate to building predictive models - they want the candidate to talk specifically about how they would develop and test a model to answer a business question.

So far, modelling has not been discussed in my interviews or in the job description - I am meant to have an understanding of statistical concepts like regression analysis etc., which I do, though I don't use them on a day-to-basis in my current data analyst role. I also have a very basic understanding of how predictive modelling works, but I have never built a model myself.

I'm wondering if this list of case studies (which is titled for the Analytics dept which, as I mentioned, contains both a Data Analyst team and a Data Science team) contains case studies that would be used for analyst roles or scientist roles only.

I have an MSc in computer science. I want to be able to do 2 things as it relates to machine learning:

* do freelance / consulting work in machine learning / data science; I want to be able to compete for machine learning related projects on [freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com) and [upwork.com](https://upwork.com); I want to be able to listen to the business problem and have an idea about what machine learning algorithms would be suitable to attack the problem with
* be competitive for remote machine learning engineering roles; I'm not aiming at companies like Facebook or Uber; I'm aiming at some small company from let's say Germany that is looking for a machine learning engineer

I made myself a curriculum that includes [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/), [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) and [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html), among other things. I started reading Elements of Statistical Learning and skimmed through the book - it seems to be much more oriented on the math than on practice. I don't think there's anything wrong with focusing on math, but I'm just not interested in going super deeply into the math and research aspects of machine learning at this moment. I'm looking to be able to apply existing machine learning algorithms.

As of now, I was thinking of something like this:

1. Read [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646)
2. Read [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf)
3. Start consulting / freelance work
4. As I do consulting / freelance work, on the side I can go deeper into the math when I see projects where a deeper math background would be beneficial

datascience,"I'm a college student studying accounting and computer science - not a data scientist - but I've been interested in the field for quite some time now. I figured now is as good a time as any to start dipping my toes into some basic, real-life applications of data science.

I suspect this problem is far, far simpler than what you normally work with, but my hope is that it could be a neat little exercise to spark some conversation for the curious minds here, as well as a glimpse into an unpopular, but surprisingly interesting industry that I suspect is ripe for the picking in terms of data: solid waste.

Now for the problem:

* I work in a landfill's accounting department. To determine our budgeted income for 2020, management made an educated guess for how many tons of solid waste they expected us to receive that year: 80,000 tons.
* To find our monthly budget, we divide 80,000 by 12. Our goal each month is 6666.66 tons. This is flawed because, weirdly enough, solid waste is seasonal. The summer months tend to be much busier.
* As an accounting clerk, my first urge was to pull our tonnage data for the past ten years, divide the sum of all januaries by the total to find the average percentage of yearly tonnage january is responsible for, do the same for all the other months, and finally apply those percentages to the 80,000-ton budget to give a better monthly goal schedule. Then I'd make it into a bar graph, get some attaboys, and call it a day.
* I want to stop thinking like an accounting clerk. This is too easy, too boring, and I don't think it fully utilizes all the data I have available to me on our SQL server. From 2005 to present, every single load, its weight, the customer who brought it in, the waste type, the town of origin, time and date, commercial vs. residential, revenue, etc. is stored in our database. About 500,000 entries. I could incorporate data from other known predictors for our tonnage, like weather and certain market indexes. 
* This is a personal project for fun. If I were a data scientist, how would I apply ML and statistical analysis techniques to this data to gain a more thorough understanding of our solid waste inflow, specifically with regards to seasonality and changes in market and weather conditions?
   * Could we have been more prepared for the decrease in business we saw as a result of the pandemic if we had a program tracking our tonnage against the market?
   * Could a program be made to query our server at the end of each day and give us an updated confidence interval in terms of expected tonnage by month-end?
   * Can this data be used to find warning signs that have gone unnoticed thus far?
   * Can this data be used to produce a better yearly prediction than 80,000 tons?

Hopefully this isn't a bad fit for the sub. If it is, please let me know and I'll take it off. I'm not looking for specific answers to my questions, but I am very curious to hear your thoughts.",Novel little problem: Predicting a landfill's monthly solid waste inflow using past data?,1607441381

# Drinking blocks a chemical that promotes attention

.Norepinephrine release to cells is diminished, causing a cascade of effects.

N a new paper, researchers from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio), report brain chemistry that may contribute to why drinkers have difficulty paying attention while under the influence.

The work is funded by generous support from the Robert J. Kleberg, Jr. and Helen C. Kleberg Foundation and by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Institute of Mental Health. Findings were published on Dec. 2 in *Nature Communications*.

I know this is a very common sort of question around here, but I was hoping for some advice based on my situation.

In brief, I have a Masters in Physics, PhD in Astrophysics, and am currently at the beginning of my second postdoc. For a number of reasons, I've decided that I want to move away from academia, and I feel like something under the umbrella of data science would be right for me. 

Python is my main language, and I use the typical packages to do analysis for my research (numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-lean, matplotlib, etc.). Though my coding is very ... academic, in that it's dirty, inefficient, but does the job, so I definitely need to brush up on proper coding skills. I also have experience with bash-scripting, MATLAB, and very basic knowledge of SQL. 

I'm comfortable with advanced maths and stats, though a bit rusty as it's been a while since I took those courses. I'm comfortable with the principles of many standard ML techniques, though I have limited experience in actually implementing them for my research. I've published papers in scientific journals, presented at a bunch of international conferences, etc.

I feel like I probably have a decent set of base skills for the data science field, but I'm struggling to figure out the appropriate level to pitch myself. After scouring LinkedIn, I get the impression that I lack certain skills, particularly on the coding front and certain languages (SQL, R, etc.). At the same time, I feel like I might be overqualified for very low level entry positions (please call me out if I'm wrong on this!).

Does anyone have any thoughts on where I should go from here? I know bootcamps are often suggested, but unfortunately I couldn't dedicate that amount of time even if I could get into one. Right now I'm mostly focusing on some Coursera courses (e.g. on Machine Learning, SQL), as well as reading through some (text) books. In time I will try to work on some small projects to throw on Github or something.
