datascience,"I work for the government as a data scientist, as my first (and so far only) post-masters job. I like my job, but I don't like where I have to live to do my job at my specific branch of the government. I may change my mind over time, but I think maybe in two or three years when I have more on my resume, I may go back to the private sector (preferably a big and more stable company, not a startup) so I will be able to go back to where I'm from (which is a big US city for tech and DS so that shouldn't be a problem). However I do hear a fair amount of chatter amongst DS people both inside and outside the government that there is somewhat of a stigma against government employees amongst big tech corps when looking to hire programmers &amp; DS, primarily for two reasons: 1, that gov employees get too used to working exactly 40 hours/week less willing to put up with being pressured/forced to do unpaid overtime frequently, and 2, that gov handles DS and SWE very differently than FAANG/etc and that the skill set is too different. I don't know about #2, but I think #1 maybe be true, because I know a couple of people (SWE and DS mostly) who left, went private, and came back because they discovered that they cared more about reasonable workloads and good PTO than making 30-50% more money &amp; getting bonuses. And honestly, I may too,  but for me it's primarily the location. 

I realize the answer is probably ""it really depends on the company and it really depends what part of the government"", but any general takes on this?",Do you think there is a stigma against (US) government employees trying to get data science jobs in the private sector?,1619307779
datascience,"Hello!

I am considering switching my master's program from Analytics to Computer Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning at Georgia Tech.

I am not considering the courses taken in the program for this decision (I can take the same courses in either program), but the title, which can make a big difference when looking for jobs.

datascience,"31/M, single, no kids. I spent the last 8.5 years as an Aviation officer where I flew and led active duty Blackhawks (UH-60M) units and have decided to leave active service and I'm actively looking to pursue a masters in data science. 

It's been a whopping 9 years since I stepped foot in a college class since graduating from Texas A&amp;M with a bachelors in history. With that being said, I've always loved historical data and analytics with a big emphasis on sports outcome (promise I'm not a degenerate). 

In all seriousness, I developed my own sports betting model about 5 years ago when I was bored off my ass in the middle of nowhere Afghanistan and following a couple tweeks, I have had a decent amount of success with my model and actually came home with a pretty penny at the Circa Sports Million challenge two years ago. 

Long story short, I want to pursue a career where I can work as a data science. Of course, my dream job would be to work for a sportsbook someday and work everyday with like minded sports fans who double as a data scientist, but I honestly have no idea how I would even get my foot in the door or where to start without any kind of math background. I've spent all of my 20s totally dedicated to the military and I didn't really realize my true passion was data science related to sports outcome until COVID allowed me to have a lot of additional time off to further research other algorithms to improve my model.

I'd like to ask for your advice on how one can advance further in their education in mastering a skill in data science. Please excuse the naivety of some questions to some professional, and I apologize beforehand if it offends you, as I'm just a lost undergraduate from a small university trying to make sense of the world. There's not many people I can ask this about because it's rather specific.

I recently took an undergraduate introductory class to statistical learning (based on the famous ISLR by Tibshirani and Hastie). I found that I like making predictions or classification based on mathematical models or by applying machine learning algorithm (among other things taught), and I want to be good at it; simple as that. Granted, people can invalidate my new interest as it had only been because of one book, but that's why I'm asking on this subreddit. I had been thinking of getting a master's degree in statistical learning  but I'm new to the world of data science so I'm sort of searching about the major without clarity. I'd like to ask people who are currently pursuing the degree or have done so, a few questions.

Here are a few questions that I have in mind, but you don't have to answer everything though it is *highly* appreciated.

1. How demanding is the a degree in statistical learning? I'm confident in my statistics, a bit wobbly sometimes in upper-level mathematics, and I'm a great google-r when it comes to coding, but is it enough?
2. I googled ""master's degree in statistical learning"" or ""master's degree in statistics and machine learning"" to find that it redirected me to *only* a few schools, some of which are top schools like Harvard, Princeton, and Imperial College. Am I googling the wrong terms that the search result doesn't yield much? Or is it because it's a major that's not as widely sought after? Or does it exist under a different name?
3. Relating to the question above, I found that sometimes it's listed under master's in Applied Statistics or Computer Science as one of their courses. I understand that statistical learning is a mix of both statistics and machine learning, but does it make any difference in difficulty (or in anything at all) if the major has its own department (i.e. Data Science, Statistics and Machine Learning) or as a course under a certain major (i.e. Computer Science, Applied Statistics)?
4. What are the things you wished you had known or mastered before going in for the degree? It helps me to see if there are some things that I can learn by myself before attending the school, or maybe solidify a few undergraduate skills.

If there's anything that you wish to put out here that doesn't answer the questions above, but still related to pursuing a master's degree in statistical learning, I'm all ears!

datascience,"**Background:**

I've worked as a software engineer for 3 years, I've worked on 3 different projects. One was far more enjoyable than the other two and it was working alongside data scientists. We wrote python (I guess the most software engineering type stuff), where we put the data into a readable web app. But we also got to do loads of fun pre-processing like determining phone numbers in different formats. We also did the more data science side of things which was SAS code to wrap statistics out from other data.

I really loved it, far more than the dull infrastructure and AWS type stuff I've had on my other work. It was really getting my down to the pandemic so I've spent a long time thinking about what it is I want to do. I think my problem is I want to do data science. I loved my big data module in uni and I did my dissertation on how we can track trends of data on smart care devices for older people.

**My problem:**

I think my problem has always been data science seemed intimidating to me because of the strong maths aspect. I love data, I love using code to accomplish tasks, I love analysing things. I often find myself daydreaming about why certain things are the way they are. But I was very much an average student in maths, not bad but not top of the group.  I guess this has always been the most intimidating part of data science to me. I'm a software engineer so I'm fine with algorithms and I often track my personal finance thoroughly, so I do quite a lot with statistics too. **Do you have to be a mathematician to be a good data scientist?**

Secondly I guess what I want to know more what data science is like as opposed to software engineering. **What tech do you normally use?** I see a lot of job posts and read a lot of stuff that sometimes it's just SQL commands which puts me off a little. I feel like there's far better ways to analyse data than just running commands through a basic database but maybe that's just me being naive.

I'm going into my second year of a MS Biostats degree with the goal of getting a statistician/data scientist role in a health-related field after graduating. 

Here are some of the courses I could take next semester:

* Statistical computing (fundamental algorithms, RNG, MCMC, EM implemented in R)
* Techniques for working with big data (hadoop/spark, unix programming, databases, version control, programming best practices)
* Clinical trials
* Longitudinal data analysis
* Survival Analysis
* Python + Pandas, Numpy, SKL, Pytorch
* Advanced Applied Stats (Mediation Analysis, ML, Bayesian techniques)

Which of these would most help me get a job/be a good statistician/data scientist?

I see many job postings ask for SKL, so perhaps taking the class on that would be good. But...I think I could probably teach myself SKL outside of school. I think it would be much harder to teach myself statistical computing or survival analysis, for example.

I graduated from a top university with a bachelors in ChemEng, got a pretty good 1st job as a process development engineer in a big pharma company in the Boston area.

I even got lucky to be involved in a data science collaboration with Harvard where we are trying to create models on process development data that I provided. I was more of a SME on the data rather than coder/data scientist, but this motivated me to transition to a full fledged data scientist and leave behind ChemEng.

Everyone on this subreddit says you need a masters or bust to break in. Fast forward to this year, applied to a small handful of masters programs in computer science.
