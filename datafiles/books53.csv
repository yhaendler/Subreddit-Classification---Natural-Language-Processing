books,"I used to be a voracious reader. A book a day-week depending on the book. Now aside reading for work (usually abstracts or data from scientific papers) or posts on social media, I haven't done any real reading in maybe 3-4 years.

I bought a book recently and now I am finding I drift off after a few lines and have to re-read because I'm just not taking it in. I seem to have only about 10% (if I'm being generous to myself) of the concentration I used to have

Social media can be fun, but I find it is ruining the pleasure of reading for fun or to learn something else. Any why read when a YouTube video can tell you?

books," ""Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI"" by David Grann has all the tropes of the True Crime drama: a murder, the investigation, the trial, and conspiracy. It is as gripping as any murder mystery, but it is heartbreaking as well. The Osage murders are a microcosm of the atrocities that white men have inflicted on Native Americans to take what is theirs throughout American history. The Osage's struggle for justice will have you asking, ""How can they let them do this?"" That frustration is balanced by former Texas Ranger Tom White who puts together an undercover team to investigate the crimes. As we follow his investigation, we see the vision that J. Edgar Hoover has for his FBI and how he uses this case to help craft it.

books,"
Here is a list of underrated shows/films that I think did justice to the books they were adapted from. (Will try to include most genres) 

1. Good Omens - Listen, the blasphemous,witty, crazy and sarcastic combination of the writers named Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman gave us this gem of a book. Extremely hilarious moments from the book adequately incorporated into the series (available in amazon prime) were due to made the best casting of David Tennant and Micheal Sheen in the leads. The unexpected age-old friendship of an angel and a demon couldnot have been portrayed by anyone better them. 
The book was a 9/10. The series was a solid 8/10. Much of the book and the series were aligned with one another except the towards ending. 
2.  Girl, interrupted - Now this was a book vastly different from the movie although key points were taken from the book. Both the book and the movie are equally amazing. The movie starts exactly how it is depicted in the movie. 
This movie has some epic actors in it with Angelina Jolie, Winona Ryder, Brittney Murphy, Jared Leto to name a few. 
The movie is set in a mental asylum where the writer (played by Winona) ends up due to an attempted suicide when she was 18 and for once I felt the movie was better than the book but that’s just me because I felt the book became to analytical towards the end. 
It’s a beautiful movie. (8/10) 
And a good read. (7/10) 
3. Me before you - while writing the manuscript, Jojo Moyes probably knew  that it would pull audiences in the theatres if made into a movie. To top it off, Emilia Clarke, Charles Dance, Janet McTeer Sam Claflin and Mathew Lewis (Yes our Neville had a glow up here) were cast in the main leads.
Louisa Clark is a cracker for a woman who had an eccentic sense of style who was forced to look for a job and ended up caring for a man who is paralysed from the neck down. Love doesn’t have a timing, you see, when it hits, it hits hard. The movie or the book doesn’t end like it should and that’s what makes it special. 
Both the book and the series get a solid 7/10 from me. 
4. Unorthodox - Another book that has some extreme differences with the plot of the series. The series is in netflix and has the same name. 
This book opened me to a world I had no idea about, the closed off, secluded world of Hasidic Judaism. The world are women and men (esp women) were not meant to know even about their own bodie, sexual education toh dure thak. A world where women aren’t meant to be too educated, so similar that world is to what we see happening in parts of our own country. 
The series is dramatised but the book is a memoir about finding freedom from a more realistic perspective.

books,"I'm not going to name specific authors because I don't want this to turn into an argument. But I'm developing this tendency to judge writers not on how much I enjoy something they've written, but by other factors.

I then saw him in a series of interviews and, for reasons I won't specify, I was put off by him (ok, it was his choice in attire and how clearly he was proud of his physique.) 

Another writer was seen by an ex of mine in a coffee shop and he was acting like a total piece of shit. So nothing by him.

I know I'm being cynical, but the main way I found success was by treating people the way I would want to be treated (which is mentioned in the book) but the thing is I DO NO WANT TO BE BULLSHITTED, and so I don't bullshit people.",I'm listening to How to Win Friends and Influence People,1600507778

This quote was featured on the very first page of Metamorphosis after the cover as a sort of teaser and something about it really resonated with me; however after reading the entire story, I do not think I came across this quote at all.

books,"I read Dune a while back, and apart from the iconic worldbuilding elements, I mostly remember being rather underwhelmed.

With the movie coming up, I re-read the synopsis, some reviews, and it seems there's something at the core of this story that I can't get behind. But maybe I missed the nuance on my first read, which is why I'm making this post.

My issues with the book are this :

One, Paul &gt;!rises to become basically a religious dictator ruling over millions of lives.!&lt; And this is considered a good thing ? From what I remember, &gt;!the crowning achievement of the first book is him establishing an authoritarian regime that's not much better than the one just before, except he has mystical powers and is supposedly a good guy.!&lt; That message irks me a lot, but maybe I missed something fundamental about Herbert's view of religious fanaticism and governments ?

Two, I remember Paul as going through the hero's journey mostly unchallenged in his righteousness. He does have a share of humbling moments, but those are about skill and power moves more than they are about moral character. As a character, I don't remember him having to face significant guilt, shame, anxiety or any other moral failing that would allow him to evolve. I remember him as being haughty, dispassionate, and being rewarded for it. Does the Litany against fear really represent what this book thinks of emotions ? You repress them and you become a super-hero ?

Am I thoroughly mistaken in my memories of the book ? Did Herbert intend to give a very different takeaway from what I remember ?",Is Dune as bad as I remember ?,1600506025

books,"One of the most pregnant cultural and religious symbols embodied in Julien Green's novels is that of **the stairs**. The author himself noticed, surprised, this small but significant detail in his journal. But, simultaneously, he emphasizes **the absolutely involuntary character of the presence of such a symbol in his writings**.

Actually, in the writings of all significant authors we can record such images and symbols encoded in the filigree of their creations. From Homer and Hesiod to Joseph Conrad and John Ronald Reuel Tolkien literature is full of such ""archetypes"" or ""paradigms"".

Scholars like Vladimir Yakovlevich Propp, Ioan Petru Culianu, Gilbert Durand, Emil Turdeanu, Northrop Frye and many others tried to explain the presence of the religious symbols in literary works.

How can we understand such a fact *without* getting lost in the labyrinth of psychoanalytical explanations?","How can we explain the presence of some religious symbols in the writings of many authors, of which they themselves were not fully aware?

books,"Winston Groom, a Southern writer who found a measure of belated celebrity when his 1986 novel, “Forrest Gump,” was made into the 1994 [Oscar-winning film](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/06/movies/film-review-tom-hanks-as-an-interloper-in-history.html) starring Tom Hanks, died on Thursday at his home in Fairhope, Ala. He was 77.

He died in his sleep, most likely from a heart attack, his stepson Frederick Helmsing said.

Mr. Groom had published three well-regarded novels and a nonfiction finalist for a Pulitzer Prize when he wrote the book that would define him as a writer and turn the Gumpian phrase “life is like a box of chocolates” into a modern-day proverb.

books,"I live in North Dakota. Recently, there were two books I read recently--one by Iris Johansen and the other by David Baldacci--that featured towns in North Dakota. Neither town they used (Dagwood, ND and London, ND) exist. It just seems very low-effort to use a location that exists, only to do it a discredit by making something up rather than learning about a location you can choose. I don't know if this is the same for everyone but I get a little hurt when people would rather make up a city name than choose one that exists.",Authors need to stop making up cities that don't exist in states that do.,1600503729

books,"Hi! My friend and I have been hunting for a book for our friend’s upcoming birthday, and this book is clearly very hard to find. It is out of print, and was originally published I believe just a few years ago. There are no copies of it (except the occasional very expensive used copy) on barnes and noble, Amazon, Powell’s, betterworldbooks, or abebooks. We also called some of our local bookstores with no luck. There also isn’t a single copy available on eBay. Any other websites to check out? 
We appreciate any advice!!
