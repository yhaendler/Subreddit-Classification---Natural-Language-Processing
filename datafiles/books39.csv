books,"I know I'm really late to read this book, but I'll be studying it next semester and I thought I'd just read it now since I have nothing to do. 

Sarah Waters is one of the best writers I have ever read. Her writing style is *chefs kiss*. The book is undeniably slow, but she just sucks you in with the writing, I've never been bored reading this book. 

The first hundred or so pages, nothing much happens. We're introduced to the characters and just read about their day to day lives and watch them interact with others and their surroundings. Let me tell you how ive practically become friends with these characters. When they're having tea, im having tea with them. The complexity and flaws of these characters are presented in such organic ways that you really do start knowing them. 

Which makes the gradual decline in their relationships, well being and happiness so devastating. Maybe I was just too emotionally attached to each character, but everything bad that happened to them hurt me *personally*. I'm a sucker for slow burn, and man, does this book burn. Everything that is introduced has a lovingly made conclusion while still being gracefully vague. 

This book has made me think. I has made me sit down and think. About class, about capitalism, about romance, about marriage, about entitlement. I can't wait to study this book. 

I highly recommend. It's a great read. Thank you Sarah waters for writing this and I will definitely be reading more of your work",The little stranger review,1594337620

books,"My grandmother was a massive history lover who sadly passed recently, she left me her history book collection which she loved. I am really happy she chose to give it to me, however, even if I was to take two dozen books it wouldn't dent her collection. There is a lot, on all aspects of WW2 and the holocaust, memoirs to historical accounts, if it's ww2 or about Irish history, you name it. It was a lifelong collection made by a woman in her 90's so you can try to imagine the scale I am talking about.

I feel it's a sin to just throw them away when I'm sure many people would love this book, but I really doubt a library would be happy to see hundreds of books dumped on them too.

I have loved books for as long as I can remember. I started reading at a very very early age and was instantly attached. When I was a YA, I would often find books that would really make me feel like I was a part of the story. I would often get to the point where if I was reading, and someone asked me a question, I wouldn’t hear them speaking to me because I was so captivated by the story. I would stay up till 3AM reading until my eyes couldn’t stay open and then dream about the book. I have longed for that feeling for a long time now that I am an adult and very rarely come across books that make me feel that way. 

I read this book so fast, stayed up very late last night, couldn’t sleep because I was thinking about it (but knew I needed to try because I have work in the morning) and then dreamed about it.

books,"One could delineate the difference at the ages; children's books are written for those who are up to 12 years old and YA is written for those from 13 to 18. But shouldn't all good fiction be able to be enjoyed by all ages? So can one truly target a certain demographic when endeavoring to write well? Wouldn't one only limit themselves and their novels if they tried to dumb down their book?

So perhaps the difference is in the main character/s? If they are 12 or under then it's a children's book, and if they're 13-18 then it's YA. But I disagree with this notion as well, since the characters are only a part of the whole that make up a novel, for the world is just as much a character, is it not? The main character may be a child or teenager, but the world could be quite real and cruel; it could involve things deemed inappropriate fore children.

No, where I believe the difference lies is in the themes, or the mood of the novel. 

His Dark Materials has a child as the protagonist, but the overall mood is pretty dark, with children getting kidnapped, and people dying. The people feel very real, or perhaps, more unaccommodating to the main character. I would not call it a children's novel, for it does not feel like a children's novel.

Six of Crows has teenage protagonists, but people often say that they do not feel or sound like teenagers, that they seem much older, and that is because they've gone through trauma or war. And so, in essence, I wouldn't call that a YA novel either. 

Something I would call the epitome of YA would be the works of Rick Riordan, where the teenagers are constantly doubting themselves and are unsure of what do to beyond the immediate future. These teenagers act like the mental image of teenagers.

And I have not read any children's books of late, but I imagine the world of children's books to be more accommodating. Something like Alice in wonderland feels more YA to me, or any other novels of its kind, those that teach kids more about the adult world, those that teach things like death and injustice, they feel more YA than children's to me, for the worlds are darker and more real.",When do children's books become YA?,1594333182

books,"I've read several Agatha Christie novels now and honestly I really enjoyed this one. 

It was very different from any of her others I've read and different than any of her Poirot novels. I really enjoyed how she focused on characters more in this one,  it seemed she spent more time on them than in others. 

I found myself really missing the characters once I finished which is not something that normally happens with her novels. 

My favorite character was Midge who ended up in a pretty good place by the end, she also was quite different from the usual characters present in her novels. 

John and Henrietta were very interesting, where John was very career focused he also felt stuck it seemed and obsessed with the past with Veronica(only to find out he really dodged a bullet there ... well at least for a bit). Henrietta is into her art but seems to have a great look at people themselves, recognizing their true selves.

The mystery seemed more like a backdrop rather than the main story and I was honestly fine with it even though it still had great twists with Gerda actually being the killer after all.

books,"I have a few series in my collection that are in mixed formats (hardcover, paperback, audiobook, etc...), usually due to them being given to me as gifts. Whenever I go looking for something to read/reread, I'll see the inconsistency and find it really annoying. Do any of you have this happen, and do you replace any of them to make a series uniform? Also, when buying a series you don't have, do you wait to get parts of it until you find it in a particular format?  
I think I would feel guilty buying a book a second time just to make it uniform. An exception maybe when going from an audiobook to a physical copy. I usually try to get the hardcover version of books/series I really like (I find paperbacks annoyingly floppy and they tend to get messed up more when carrying them around), but if I have others in the same series in a different format, I'll try to get the version that matches.  This is especially annoying when the last book I need is only sold used at $100+ in that format. I would hate to re-buy the entire series, so at that point I just get whatever is available.

books,"Two years ago I picked up Confederacy of Dunces as part of a book club I was doing for my discord. I've always been a somewhat avid reader for things related to my field or for YA trash so this was my first real foray into hyper-realism. Before that I had read books like Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Dune, Etc. The book changed my entire perception of reading. The other books let you immerse yourself into some world where you get to imprint yourself as some heroic rogue, magical teenager or genius aristocrat, but in Confederacy the only people you get are a fat pseud and his alcoholic mother. You get a run-down strip club, a shitty hot-dog stand and a blue-jean factory office with a senile old woman and man and wife in the most unhappy marriage possible.                



Later I got a chance to read ""Infinite Jest,"" a book that had been called ""pretentious"" (it's really not, it's just a normal book) and found a very touching study of a dysfunctional family and the problems that success breeds. The storyline was very complex and gave deep character study to many people as well as broadening my overall understanding of many things.                    



Not to say YA/Fantasy books are bad or anything but there's a clear difference in the type of reading required and the take-away is vastly different- I still read fantasy but young adult fantasy should really not be the bulk of your reading.

books,"You've gotta read this book, honestly. Its frantic, highly stylish prose and extremely well captured 80s atmosphere blending in with believable sleazeball college students makes this, pretty much, an exaggerated, highly entertaining portrait of 80s America (I hope). Its filled with romps of excitement. You can finish this book in a single sitting with how fast paced it is. It basically follows the lives of college students at Camden (a fictional liberal arts college) in the 80s but its not a linear story. Its told from multiple perspectives, there is no real central plot or objective or goal or anything and most of it doesn't really make much sense as a linear story anyways but you'll start somewhere at the middle of the term and end at the end of the term. The plot events don't really follow one another but it isn't like a memoir with anecdotes all over either and the characters don't really grow through the story. Everyone is just as much of an asshole at the end as at the beginning. What I like the most about this book though and Ellis' writing in general is his ability to paint a picture and getting out that perfect image without ever going into details about a scene. Some writers tend to do that like Stephen King, a popular example, he usually sets the scene and then gets to the dialogue but Ellis breaks all conventions with frantic random descriptions of random objects, I'm not well read enough to know if other writers do this as well. This is also the funniest book I've ever read and certainly the most pulp as there's not really a point to any of this or any message the writer is trying to get out.

The problems I can see is how there are a lot (like A LOT) of jokes that are sexual, controversial, and borderline offensive (I enjoy them, but yeh...the internet has been more sensitive lately). Female characters weren't that interesting, and the romance was really like a teen movie: bland and cliched. But there's a heavy suggestion, of a character who is a sadistic homo-erotic dude that just left a huge hole in the story after leaving the school. And scenes, where the characters are playing cricket and football/rugby, are just one of the parts I don't really understand (because I never played them sadly) 

But I still enjoyed the series dearly.

Seeing Spud grow, and his change of demeanor through the things he has seen and how he never succumbed into madness was one thing I like about him. And how his written experiences made me nostalgic for the days where I was boisterous and full of curiosities. Reading them is more of like a ""re-experience"" of all the crazy things, my friends and I have done back in highschool. 

It truly was an enjoyable read for me, and I would like to hear your thoughts about it as well :)",Has anybody read the Spud series by John van de Ruit?,1594308593

books,"Hello everyone,

Welcome to the first discussion thread of July for *The Leavers* by Lisa Ko. Hopefully you all managed to find a copy of the book. As always, you will find some questions below to help kick off the discussion, but feel free to discuss anything you want from the first four chapters.

* What do you think happened to Deming's mother?

&gt; If only he had the right clothes, knew the right references, he would finally become the person he was meant to be

* So far the book has dealt quite extensively with the theme of wanting, and maybe even needing, to belong. Do you think Deming/Daniel feels this in particular or is this something everyone can relate to?

* What do you think the significance is of the switch between the times the author uses the name Deming and when she uses Daniel? Do you notice it while reading?

* What is your impression of Kay and Peter so far?

* Why do you think Daniel is hesitant of replying to Michael's email?

books,"Hi, r/books! I’m Adrienne Brodeur, a newcomer to Reddit, and author of the memoir “WILD GAME: My Mother, Her Secret, and Me,” paperback out now. AMA.
 
Named a Best Book of the year by People, NPR, Slate, Washington Post, Audible, BuzzFeed, Real Simple, and others, WILD GAME just launched in paperback. It is described as an “electrifying, gorgeously written memoir that will hold you captive until the last word” (People Magazine) and a “page-turning memoir that reads like heady beach fiction” (Publishers Weekly). Set on Cape Cod, WILD GAME tells a daughter’s tale of living in the thrall of her magnetic, complicated mother, and the chilling consequences of her complicity.
