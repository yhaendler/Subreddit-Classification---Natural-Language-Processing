books,"I posed this question to the readers on my blog, but no one could answer it. I'm not going to do that here. I will just tell you the answer.

Let us take Emile Zola for instance. It is best to refer to many of his works by their French titles, and here's why.

For some of Zola's works, in English alone there are 3-4 different titles, apparently of different translations! I can't even keep all of the English versions straight in my head. Now suppose I want to talk to my friends who read Zola in Finnish, Italian, Polish, and German? No doubt the titles were translated natively in those languages. I don't know about the others, but I know one of the Finnish ones has a native title. Ok I start talking to my friends who speak these other languages. We've all read the same Zola novels, but we've read the same books under different titles. It's not so easy to back-translate to English and try to figure out which book they are referring to. Try it for Finnish if you dare!

I was on a forum where they were discussing Zola's work cross-linguistically with European readers who spoke different languages, and started to see what a mess it was. A Finnish man had read one of the works in Finnish and they were trying to figure out the corresponding work in English or French.

Sure you could go on the Net and throw the titles in and see what  you come up with.

But there is a simpler way to do it. Simply refer to the original Zola title by its French title. Le Debacle, Le Ventre du Paris (4-5 different titles in English alone!), L'Assomior, Pot Boille, La Curee, Au Bonheur des Dammes, Fecundite, La Reve, La Terre, and L'Oveure. It probably helps that these works were originally made famous in French.

Some like Germinal and Nana are probably left in the original French. Some with proper nouns in the title are probably easy to spot cross-linguistically, such Le Docteur Pascal, Le Faute de l'Abbe Mouret, Le Fortune des Rougons, etc. 

This works well for a lot of Huysmans' works too, best known by their original titles. Actually this applies to quite a few French 19th century works. Even today, most of Alain Robbe-Grillet's work is referred to by its French title for some reason.

I am not sure how well this works with other languages. We mostly know the Russians by their English translations. The same with the Germans, Czechs, Poles, Japanese, and Norwegians. 

Italian, Spanish, Greek, Slovak, Arabic, Persian and Portuguese novels are not much translated into a variety of different languages, nor are they massively read cross-linguistically. Japanese and Chinese lit is not much read cross-linguistically. There are some English translations, but probably not many others.",Why It Might Be Better to Refer to the Names of Some Non-English Language Works by Their Native Titles,1591310076

books,"I used to really enjoy reading as a kid (I was the “500 page books in 2 days type kid), but as I’ve gotten older my interest in them has waned. Recently, though, I wanted to try again, 1. Because books can be a good way of gaining new perspectives and just getting a good mental workout overall, and 2. My ability to express myself in speech/writing has always been my biggest struggle, even though I’m better at it than most people, and reading really helps me absorb a natural feel for speaking/writing effectively. Every time I try to read a new book, though, I always end up trying to slow down and pay attention to every word to spot nuance. I can’t actually tell if this is a habit I got from AP English (LOL) or just my brain slowing down because it’s not used to heavy workloads with reading. But, I’m leaning more towards the former because there’s been times I read pretty word-heavy stuff at a much faster rate when I wasn’t focused on trying to “understand the author’s message” or “understand the character’s motivations” (I put that in quotes because from what I’ve heard a lot of times it can take YEARS to really thoroughly understand a book). Anyways, even with the slowing down, I think it ironically makes my comprehension worse? Like I see the details but not the bigger picture, whereas if I just read regularly I feel like I understand the gist of what a character is saying, and even the themes of the book as a whole, much more clearly....that might just be an illusion though LOL. And the issue is that even though I know that I need to pick up the pace, my mind just automatically tries to focus on every word, afraid it’ll miss something. So, if anyone has had this issue before, is there a good solution for it? (Aside from what I already probably know, which is that I have to fully realize that maybe I can just read a book for fun and not to be intellectual and impress people, and that even if I miss some things if I read the right book I can still learn some valuable lessons?)",How to get out of reading super slowly (or if I even should?),1591309365

Last week I placed an order on Book Depository (Thursday the 28th on the afternoon) which should have been shipped before 3 business days (Around Tuesday or Wednesday). It was finally shipped this morning (Thursday the 4th). Along the shipping confirmation email, I received this one:

*""Dear Customer,*

The screaming, struggling civilian was a dark man with a face white as flour from fear. His eyes were pulsating in hectic desperation, flapping like bat's wings, as the many tall policemen seized him by the arms and legs and lifted him up. His books were spilled on the ground. 'Help!' he shrieked shrilly in a voice strangling in its own emotion, as the policemen carried him to the open doors in the rear of the ambulance and threw him inside. 'Police! Help! Police!'

The doors were shut and bolted, and the ambulance raced away. There was a humorless irony in the ludicrous panic of the man screaming for help to the police while policemen were all around him. Yossarian smiled wryly at the futile and ridiculous cry for aid, then saw with a start that the words were ambiguous, realized with alarm that they were not, perhaps, intended as a call for police but as a heroic warning from the grave by a doomed friend to everyone who was not a policeman with a club and a gun and a mob of other policemen with clubs and guns to back him up.

books,"I was reading r/books today and came across a controversial thread discussing the book Walden which got me thinking regarding the revulsion towards self-reflection within today's culture.

[Thread in Question](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gvt82y/every_time_i_reread_walden_i_get_more_frustrated/)

To give you a brief breakdown, the thread's original poster explains how they felt that the book Walden was misrepresented when it was taught to them in high school and that they have seen similar critiques in academia and recent broader literary discussions.  They feared that this misguided teaching was both unfair to Thoreau and a missed opportunity for America's youth to expand their thought.  

While there was some low level discussion regarding the posters thoughts, replies within the thread quickly become a disaster. 

Excluding the previously mentioned replies, there were an enormous number of replies accusing the original poster of misrepresenting their teachers/professors as well as a near equal number of replies of trashing the book in question and Thoreau.

I have noticed in social media (especially reddit) that Thoreau, specifically Walden, have become unhip within modern culture.  As typified in this thread, there was much Walden/Thoreau bashing, accusing the author and their work as being inauthentic.  

Breaking the thread to its essence, these redditors are accusing the original poster as well as Thoreau of being total phonies.  Which I find hilarious, as another book that reddit loves to hate (and has also become unhip in modern culture) is the Catcher in the Rye, being a book about a know-it-all youth who accuses those around him as total phonies.

Both these books were well respected amongst the youth, counter culture, and progressive thought of their time.  And yet they are now being accused of being outdated and un-relatable.

I think this is a product of our time.  In modern culture, people prefer to consume books (and media in general) that look towards an ideal.  In a sense, we have become more puritanical and if the media we consume does not reflect this ideal it is rejected.  Modern youth have access to the internet, mass quantities of information far beyond their comprehension.  They look around and see phonies everywhere.  And the idea of reading a book where a young person thinks they know everything and looks around seeing phonies everywhere but in reality is still very immature and has growing up to do, does not sit well within this perspective.

The hate of Thoreau follows this pattern.  His books are an exercise in self-reflection but the modern critique is that they are unrealistic and out of touch.

I knew I loved Pratchett's work. It's been a large influence in my own writing, helping me realize that writing can be funny and sardonic without preaching.

books,"Sometimes I’ll read something and after all I can think about for weeks is “How did that even get published?!”. Some books are just so bad that it’s almost insulting that it ever ended up in a readers hands. 

The book that did this for me is “Children of Icarus” by Caighlan Smith. I didn’t enjoy a single moment of this book. The writing was messy and confusing at some points, the style overtakes the story at point with the author overusing periods to the point that it is genuinely annoying. Every single character is unlikeable in every way. The book tries really hard to make me like the character’s, but they are just too flawed. The main character is the worst of them all, I hated her so much that it tainted the rest of the story. The ham-fisted love story feels awkward and out of place and completely pointless. I honestly wish I had never seen this book, I got nothing out of it. It wasn’t even good in a “it’s so bad it’s good” kind of way.

Hello, everyone!

I want to read more books, but I find that I struggle with finishing the majority of books I start, and I want to change that by actually reading more.

I think it may be a variety of factors that contribute to this problem for me.

I'm a slow reader. I sometimes have to re-read the same sentence over and over before I can actually understand it, or I backtrack a few pages because I forgot about something that happened or was mentioned a few pages ago. It's also hard for me to visualize scenes and characters.

I also have a short-attention span and am easily distracted, so I get bored after a few pages or my mind just keeps getting off track and find myself musing deeply about something before I remember I'm supposed to be reading.

I found a novel to read for now, and I think I'm just going to read at least one chapter a day for now. 

However, even within the span of a chapter, I find I still want to take breaks after a certain number of pages, but finish the rest of that chapter later in the day.

The main reason I want to change is because I like to write fiction, and the commonly repeated phrase is ""Great writers are avid readers,"" and I have accepted I'm going to need to read more.

Another possible reason for me is that when I was a kid, I thought reading was forced on me by school and my parents, so I probably saw it like chores. Gotta read for fifteen minutes before I can play. 

TL;DR

I don't read a lot but I want to read more. 

Any advice on becoming a more avid reader?","I want to read more, but find it hard",1591286463
books,"I am re-watching Fellowship of the Ring and as I saw Sauron again I started thinking about how vastly different he is in the books lore. That he is this beautiful, likable character and immediately I realized the other two other major fantasy series with massive adaptations, Harry Potter and A Song of Ice and Fire, did this as well. 

Lord Voldemort had his wits together in the books unlike the movies where his laughably insane. A notable scene being how he insults Neville in the movie but speaks to his bravery in the books, essentially showing a deranged villain versus a cunning one.

Lord Baelish in A Song of Ice and Fire is this charismatic, well-liked character in which Ned is more of the outlier in disliking him. Even GRRM has noted this drastic change, in which show Baelish is distrusted and hated, while in the books his power entirely derives from him being seen as this dependable ally.

What I can't figure out is why are fantasy novels so willing to have characters with facades/complexity like these three, but must be so drastically simplified in their adaptations? Is Hollywood lacking confidence in their own writing/presentation of fantasy? 

Do they think having characters that are wholly despicable sell better? If they do, I would disagree, as The Dark Knight's Joker shows you can have a villain say something agreeable and have mass market appeal.

books," I don't think history gets spoiler warnings, but I'll be vague. One of the best nonfiction books of all time, definitely my personal favorite. I won't say that my political philosophy 100% lines up with his, but let's not turn this into a polarizing cherry-pick session.

The book was written with Alex Haley over several years. Early firebrand Malcolm said a lot of really deep truths, but also had a lot of uninformed opinions. I won't try to spin this one way or the other, that's just who he was at the time. I think it throws a lot of people off.

The reason for my YSK is that later he had a profound shift in philosophy and he asked to keep the tone of the early years chapters the same so that people could see how he was back then, and see how profound his change was. Most people (reddit and beyond) boil down him into a one-dimensional historical foil to MLK, which just is not accurate. So much of what he points out wasn't solved by the Civil Rights Movement and largely rings true today.

Anyway, please read it, get a copy from your library or bookstore, and then watch the movie afterward because it's an ok adaptation but has a heartbreaking addendum at the end","If you decide to read the Autobiography of Malcolm X this year, there's a good reason to hold back judgment until you finish the book.",1591286017

Horror was a very popular genre in the 19th century, but Poe gave it a quality that it had never been seen before, to do so he created some of the rules for a good short story, it must be short enough to read in one seat and every word must contribute to the pourpose of the text. His stories are incredible hypnotic, this is due to the perfection of the style and language.

books,"I just read the Kew book on growing house plants, and the experience was thoroughly soured by the bad translation. Some parts were just kept in English (forgot to translate?), parts of sentences were missing, and some parts just didn't make sense because an important word was left out. I guess the translator wasn't given enough time, or the publishing company just didn't bother to proof read. But it did remind me if other translation issues I've run into over the years.

I remember, for example, reading Moby Dick in translation, and being very confused at the part where the narrator explains why a sperm whale is called a sperm whale: because of the sperm like fluid in its head. In translation, it didn't make sense, because a sperm whale is not called that in Dutch.
