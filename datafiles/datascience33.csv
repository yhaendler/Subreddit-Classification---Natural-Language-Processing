For a start, I have picked all interactions on relation to changing rate plan. Customers can use any channel to change their plan - web, app, call care support, chat with an agent, visit store etc. I am looking for a way to measure pain in their journey while changing plans - how much time did it take to browse plans and make a choice, was the app experience so bad that the customer had to call care center, were there any wrong expectations set or miscommunication that made the customer call back care after the change (issues with billing, device etc)

One way I thought made sense would be to use CSAT score, find correlation with features like time spent, number of calls or visits, number of times channels was switched, and try to come up with a way to quantify the pain experienced in each step.

datascience,"Hello everyone,

I've seen variations of the question ""What is the future of data science?"" asked before, but I think mine is unique enough that it would make for a good discussion in its own post. It's based on a 2020 RStudio Conference presentation mentioned in some other posts, called ""[Value in Data Science Beyond Models in Production](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/value-in-data-science-beyond-models-in-production/)"".

In the presentation, the speaker makes the case for why Data Scientists should focus their efforts on providing value through things ***other than*** deploying machine learning to production. As an aside, I think the definition of ""Data Scientist"" he is using is more of a Decision Scientist. The gist of his message is:

* Machine Learning Engineers are likely going to take the ML work that Data Scientists currently do, and will create off-the-shelf ML tools (e.g. AutoML), hence decreasing the need for Data Scientists to do ML.
* Data Engineers are already better than Data Scientists at cleaning data, building pipelines, and warehousing, and so this part of the data science process will be owned by Data Engineers.
* What work does that leave for Data Scientists? What the speaker describes sounds like the work of a Product Analyst:
   * Business Intelligence-type work (metric design, measurement, goal-setting, creating self-service data tools)
   * A small amount of ad-hoc ML modeling
   * Inform business strategy / product design based on data analysis
   * Experimentation
   * The human side of data work - ethics and communication

Here are some questions that the presentation raised for me:

* Do you think his prediction is accurate?
* Will the work of tomorrow’s Data Scientist be more like today's Product Analyst?
* Do you think his prediction is only true of the tech industry, or does it apply to all industries?",The Future: Value in Data Science Beyond Models in Production,1591664235

datascience,"Dear Data Magicians

'tis the time. Show me your DS Stack! Our field is going through rapid transitions, many of these focused on operationalization (yes it is a word). In a sense, how do we jump from the '*guy in the basement who comes up with cool models*' to '*well oiled machinery that spits out and maintains awesome models*'. 

Let's standardise the responses somewhat, then I'll collect the responses as much as I can at the end of this main post. 

I'd like people to simply list the technology they use at their firm. Some of us may use experiment tracking, others do not. Some may require high-frequent updates, others do not, and so forth.

Please add a link to the technology you refer to :-)

&amp;#x200B;

|Technology|Purpose|Open Source/Closed Source|Pricing|Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[weights and biases](https://wandb.com/)|Experiment tracking and documentation|Closed source|Free (personal), 35/user, and 175/user (corp)|Really solid piece of software. Good support for most ML frameworks|
|[Data Version Control](https://dvc.org)|Data versioning|Open Source|Free|We use it in particular for Deep Learning|
|[AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)|Serving and training|Open Source (somewhat)|Depends on the tier (min. 0.08$/hr)|Not really great for custom models|

&amp;#x200B;

**Tech. challenges I've yet to find a solution for:**

* How to best manage models that read/write from DBs best way possible?
* Efficient ways to automatically run tests on X independent separate ML models
* Best way to store and access (large) flat files

**Curious to try or work with**

* Kubeflow
* MLflow
* GCP vs AWS vs Azure vs Bluemix - Pros/Cons?

**Best advice**

* If you don't have one already - Design a standardised best practices handbook for your team. You should have a template for a DL project, as well as smaller ML projects. The template should be designed in a way that allows for easy reproducibility and productisation (See previous post I've written [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gw8z13/do_you_code_in_object_oriented_way_in_python_when/fsu2p8p?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x))
* The rest of your organisation is not necessarily interested in what you are interested in. **Do not focus on mathematical rigor but business objectives.** 
* **Fail fast:** If you cannot get some value relating to the business objective out of the data, post cleaning of course, move on. Summarise findings and what you think is needed to achieve the sought after business objective (Additional data / Other data / Qualitative analysis - Shadow a worker in a function), hypothesise on the reasons for why the relation is not there.

datascience,"Hi everyone! This is gonna be long so please bear with me. Let me just give your a little bit of background so that you guys could offer me a specific advice. Thank you in advance! 

Background: I did my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering and graduated last year itself, but I realized in my second year that I’m not really into that. Hence, I did business related internships in Business Development. Where I come from, it’s not easy to switch majors and you are not given much options in the first place. After graduation, I started working in B2B sales which I really liked but at the end of the day I wasn’t learning or improving myself. The role was good enough for improving soft-skills but not the technical skills. I left in December, and decided to go for Masters in Management with a concentration in International Business. Later, I got an admit from one of the finest schools in Canada and the program is starting in Jan next year. They also had a business analytics program, but I didn’t apply considering that I didn’t have the analytical skills. But, I learned those within a span of 6 months, from Jan this year to June. I learned SQL, Tableau, Python, and advanced Excel. Also, I applied for a job and got in as a profile of operations analyst, but the work seems very different from what I imagined as a data analyst or a person in data science does. 

The silver lining is that the company which I just joined in June has a data analytics department where a person could move after 6 months of so if he/she performs well. At this point of time, I’m really confused. I really want to get into Data Science and this seems like a right way. But, in case I’m not able to change departments, I will be stuck here and miss out my chance of going to Canada. Also, I think, I made a mistake of not applying to data related master programs. So, should I apply to data science/ BA related courses now? 

Any feedback will be helpful as I have got 6 months to figure this out. My ultimate goal is to be in a field where I could improve my hard skills.",Looking for a career change!,1591598101
