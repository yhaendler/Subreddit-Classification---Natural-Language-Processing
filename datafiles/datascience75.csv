datascience,"Suppose you are the manager of an airplane company. For the last 10 years, for every flight, you have the amount of time passengers had to wait before the airplane took off. 

You are responsible for posting on the airplane company's website ""how much time passengers can expect to wait"". You need to provide a single, general time that all passengers will have to wait in the future  E.g. 45 minutes for all future flights 

Right now, i am thinking of aggregating the data by monthly averages. Then, I would take different horizontal lines (e.g. x = 10 mins,  x = 11 mins, x = 12 mins) and compute the mse between these horzontal lines and the aggregated time series. Which ever value of x gives the smallest mse, this would be the most realistic waiting time .

datascience,"Hi there, 

As part of my MSc project, I am attempting to find a method to gradually increase the dot product between the Q and K vectors within a Transformer, as a way of manually altering the self-attention weights post-training. So far, I have found [an equation](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/18615/how-do-i-linearly-interpolate-between-two-vectors) which allows me to interpolate between the two vectors as a way of making their direction and magnitude more or less similar, however, this does not always result in a higher dot product between the two. 

From what I understand now, if I was to increase the dot product, I would need a method which makes K more similar to Q in terms of direction, whilst simultaneously increasing the magnitude of K (if I wanted to lower the dot product, I would do the opposite). Does anyone know of a way I could do this? Could I just use the interpolation equation and multiply the resulting vector by a scalar value to increase the magnitude? 

Thank you!",Gradually increase the dot product between transformer Q and K vectors manually,1610205755

datascience,"For my 2nd semester of my current uni year I was given these 2 as an option for an elective course and I want to hear more perspectives or experiences from others in data science.   


From what I could see regarding course information:

* Derivative markets and Discrete Time Finance syllabus introduces derivative securities, forward and option contracts in risk management, discusses use of derivatives in investment strategies, concept of arbitrage-free pricing, the fundamental theorem of asset pricing in discrete time, pricing on the binomial tree. Following up from the course I did in semester 1: Portfolio Theory 
* Whereas Ordinary Differential Equations introduces Linear systems of ODEs, Laplace transforms, discusses Boundary value problem, as well as Phase Planes. Following up from the course I did last year: Linear Algebra. 

&amp;#x200B;

Derivative Markets also gets a followup next year for Continuous Time Finance which strictly requires me to take Derivative Markets this semester.   


From what I roughly gathered through a bit of research, ODEs seem to be in this middle ground for application, some have said that they don't really come into application that much, some have said that the more advanced followup of Partial Derivatives Equations are very useful when it came to optimization. I also do find it odd that ODEs is only exclusive to the program I've selected: Statistical Data Science, and that Actuarial Science students cannot select this topic and are forced to select Derivative Markets.   


Is the choice as simple as ""Do I want a finance course or not"" or is there more to decide when it comes to making a decision between the two of these?","Which course will be more beneficial for an aspiring Data Scientist?

I am a student in my last year Msc in statistics and I intend to work as a data scientist (hopefully) .

Then I left and started working at company B, found out an awefully similar problem X'. Instead of implementing the architecture from scratch, wouldnt it be better to simply buying the data from company A, creating a model that uses this data + some from company B (to adapt it properly) and solve X' much more easily?

In this case, can I, as a data scientist just buy data from companies as I work in those companies in case I need it? (this way I can make sure it's not lost and dont have to go through the hassle of making company A and B communicate to sell the data)

I have created a web endpoint that provides long term company data.  It’s in its first iteration currently, but there is an example on the homepage and a link to some documentation. 

The primary use case is access to annual report data, in json.  All data reported by the queried company is available through the API.

The site provides access to ongoing lawsuits, some news, companies that are know to be fraudulent and a direct feed of all releases from the SEC.
