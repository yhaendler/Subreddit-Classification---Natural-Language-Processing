books,"There's been something I think about and it's pretty common but it's this idea that schools kill a desire to read. I experienced it temporarily in late middle school early high school where it wasn't until my junior year that I even read a book again and I'm sure plenty of you guys have your own story's related to that. But my thing is as people who read yourself how do you think reading should be done in schools?

See for me personally I get why you need to force otherwise the kids would just read a narrow selection of YA books they enjoy (I know this isn't strictly true, I read non fiction and military books a lot and I know people who read other weird stuff that doesn't fit this generalization but it's a generalization) and never engage with the larger world of books and in particular the classics of ""western cannon"" or whatever. On the other hand if forcing kids to read these books is causing so many complaints about how they hate reading and in part might be creating these stats that ~25% of adults haven't read a book in a year that kinda defeats the point.",Discussion: How should we approach reading in schools?,1590364103
books,I finished the book a few days ago and I'm still going through some of the notes I made because there is just too much to digest.

books,"I‚Äôm not talking about the usual strategy of eliminating the ‚ÄúPerson 1 said‚Äù and ‚ÄúPerson 2 replied‚Äù bits after a conversation between two characters gets going and an order is clearly established and you automatically know who is speaking.

What I‚Äôm actually talking about is...well, I read Sphere and noticed that during scenes involving multiple characters (more than 2), Crichton would sometimes stack a bunch of separate pieces of consecutive dialogue without ever clearly identifying who is speaking. So I‚Äôd sit there wondering, ‚ÄúI wonder if Harry said that...or Barnes...or Beth...‚Äù

I find this mildly annoying. I get that maybe Crichton is more interested (at times) in pacing and ideas and the vibe of a busy conversation than making clear who, exactly, is speaking. But I guess it‚Äôs just tough for me to adjust to that.

It's ebbed and flowed over the years obviously and I generally flit between the same 4 genres: Sci-Fi/Saga Fantasy/Thriller and then oddball suggestions from wherever that are harder to categorise.

However I mostly just go where the story takes me, if a book is good I give it quite a bit of leeway. The story can have plotholes and I'm quite forgiving or be clich√©d or fundamentally flawed. As long as they are enjoyable worlds to be in I'm kinda in for the ride anyway.

However I don't really ""ruminate"" on what I read. If I went to a book club I'd probably have very little to say other than ""yeh I enjoyed it"".

books,"There are actually 3 questions below, in case you want to skip the prolog.

I am from and live in Austria, thus my first language is German. I've found it much more enjoyable, though, to read books in English (same goes for movies and serieses). With the lockdown that took place in Austria I needed some more books to read and so I ordered two from my local bookstore, both of them in English. My sister also ordered two books, both of them in German. Her books arrived the week after, mine arrived yesterday --&gt; 2 months after ordering them.

Now obviously this is related to the pandemic and the measures taken in every respective country. But, I asked the owner of the book store why the English books arrived so much later. She said: ""They are printed either in the US or the UK, get shipped to Germany and she gets them from there.""  
I was not aware, that this is the case. I thought books (at least books in English) were printed in Germany or Austria and then distributed to book stores on demand. This revelation is actually making me consider switching to E-books, because of the environmental footprint the physical book has with such a long transport.

Now, I checked some of the books on my shelf and indeed they were either printed in the UK or the US. Interestingly, though, I got all three books from Leigh Bardugo's ""Shadown and Bone""-trilogy. But I bought each one from a different store. Book 1 I got from a German book store chain. Book 2 just arrived from my local book store. And book 3 I got from Amazon, as it was not available at the others.   
Book 1 --&gt; printed in the US  
Book 2 --&gt; printed in the UK  
Book 3 --&gt; printed in the US  


All of this leaves me with 3 questions:

1. Do books written in English only get printed in English-speaking countries? (or more general: Do books written in language X only get printed in countries where that languague is spoken?)
2. If so, does this actually make sense economically? (This one is defenitley more targeted at books in English, as it seems clear that very few people in Austria would read a book written in Chinese. A lot of people I know prefer to read in English though, so demand seems to be there.)
3. As the example above suggests, the books could be printed either in the US or the UK. Is there a way for me to know where the book is coming from before I buy it?",Are books written in English only printed in English-speaking countries?,1590335904

Are encyclopedias of fictional universes (think: Encyclopedia of Hyrule) fiction or nonfiction?

My first instinct was that it's obviously fiction. But then as I thought about it more, I kept waffling back and forth as I thought about exceptions and exceptions to the exceptions...

Fiction always tells a story, right? Well, in that sense, an encyclopedia, even about fictional material, fails that test. On the other hand, non-fiction is always about facts and truth, at least as far as the author is concerned. Accounts of alien abductions, for example, are generally considered non-fiction, because they're relaying information that is at least purported to be truthful.

However, I have been thinking about the implications of what the book suggests. So the conclusion seems to be that aside from talent and hard work, there are several factors which create success which can be summarised by the phrase ""being the right person, at the right time, at the right place"" . 

Obviously the ""being the right person, at the right time, at the right place"" is something we cannot control hence it kinda implies that out success will be always limited by strong factors that are completely out of our control. I agree from my practical experience that this seems the be one of the ""cold realities"" of our lives. It's kinda saddening TBH but I don't see any other way to interpret this. 

Let me know if you guys agree with my interpretations.","The implications of Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers""",1590327258

books,"I was inclined to do some work on improving my English skills and found that transcribing might help with it. So I just started with it, and as I just started I am not yet there with its affect, but it is fun, and as it requires me to do it on the desk I feel like I am focussing more on the book than before, even though I am busy writing word by word. It also helps me with pushing through the book somehow, when I am in bed I often read a couple of page and happen to put it back down. One negative is, which all knows, it slows down the reading speed immensely.

Apart from my experience, curious if anyone else is doing it, and whether you found it beneficial (or can be for fun).",Anyone transcribe while reading?,1590326798
books,"When I have read Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, I honestly felt my life was about to change. Well, yeah, I am a man with high expectations and dreams in life. But with Pip's drastic rise from the commoner's life he once had and the measures that accompany his rise, I became dubious of my own dreams. I mean, dreams and expectations never ceased to occupy my mind, but I became curious on how far I am willing to take just to achieve my dreams and meet my expectations in life. I became obsessed with Joe's saying that I made it my motto:

""If you can't get to be oncommon through going straight, you'll never get to do it through going crooked.""

books,"So I remember reading a book in middle school, called ""Geeks: How Two Lost Boys Rode The Internet Out of Idaho"", an amazing book and definitely changed my views on life as a young kid. This book is now 20 years old, wow. However, my question is that this book I just realised is marked as a biography/non-fiction meaning that it's true and the characters are real. So I'm wondering if anyone knows or can help my figure out who the characters are based on or their names or something? I'm not sure if he changed it all to protect their identity or what, but I definitely wouldn't change my name if a book was being written about me haha. But i've looked up as much as I could and found absolutely zero zilch nada about the characters ""Jesse"" and ""Eric"". If anyone could give me any background info or sources or anything, i'm just super interested in how these people turned out. It has been 20 years like I said, that's a long time. Who knows right?

books,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I really liked the prose, the characters were very fitting, some of the mistakes they make are relatable because I've been there. That said, sometimes the author does take it a bit overboard tho, that one event about Conell being depressed because some guy he barely knows killed himself. I guess he was building up to that depression and that was the trigger but still felt like it could've been done better. I also don't get WHY Marianne's brother hates her. And sometimes, the author would insert a completely ideological viewpoint that felt forced but it still fit the characters that presented it so that's alright. I feel like even after finishing the story, I don't really understand the two main characters fully. Their personalities are very chaotic, impulsive and difficult to pin down and nothing much happened in the book really. I guess it fits the title. It felt like a slice of life anime tbh lol, I enjoyed it a lot tho, particularly because I'm in the same age group as the characters I guess. I don't think it deserves as much praise as it gets but it is good. That's it, just felt like sharing my thoughts here.",I just finished reading Normal People by Sally Rooney,1590326110

books,"I see a lot of **WEIRD** questions pop up, again and again and again on this sub. People asking how to read faster, better or more. If they should stick with books they hate or even how to read non fiction. I'm afraid I have no answers for those questions (but good luck to you....well, obviously don't read stuff you hate, too many books out there!)  


I noticed that having my reading list fixed (as in what I'm going to pick up after I finish my current book and then the book after that etc.) is **DULL** and **BORING**, for me at least, so I came up with another ""system"" that I'll probably go by until I die and it's very simple and **ALWAYS** works!  


I use a Kindle myself so I can see percentages but you can easily do this with a physical book as well. So when I have 10% or less left in a book (Basically you'd just eyeball it with a physical one). I'll make a mental note of the fact that ""OK, 10% or less until I finish this book"" and having that in mind, I'll let that finishing stretch tell me what to pick next. For instance:  


I was reading a book and during the final stretch, the phrase: ""A mote of light"" appeared at least twice, so because of that, in my mind, the book was telling me to next pick up the Sci-FI book: *""The Mote in God's Eye""* The reason this works so well is that, even if your TBR list is BIG like I bet is the case with most users on this sub, subconsciously you'll always have a general idea of what's on there and I've found that this method of mine, in fact, deep dives quickly into your sub conscious mind in less than a second when prompted to do so, often by a single word, and pulls something out for you to read.

So the parrot is probably the easiest one. The parrot represent Caden‚Äôs doctor, Doctor Poirot. 

The crows nest, I believe, is the place where the patients went to get their medication, the beverages were the assortment of medications that would change occasionally. 

The captain is a tricky one. When I first read the book I thought the Captain wasn‚Äôt symbolic, but after my second time reading it I think the Captain represents Caden‚Äôs illness itself.


The caption(Caden‚Äôs illness) pushes Caden to kill(stop trusting) the parrot(his doctor) and encourages Caden to not visit the crows nest(place where he gets his medication)
