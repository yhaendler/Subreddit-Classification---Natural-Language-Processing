datascience,"TL;DR Does anyone have any opinion on how an Urban Outfitters tech role (Data scientist) will look on a resume or have any experience working there in a tech role?

I'm a Junior completing a degree that's a mix of CS, Math, and information sciences. I previously worked as a Data Engineer for Bloomberg, and I just started a Data Scientist role for a small defense contractor (60 people). I'm currently going part-time, but I will have the opportunity to go fulltime for a 6 month period that my school integrates. Before I accepted my current role, I had applied to URBN, specifically, a relatively new subsidiary called Nuuly for a Data Scientist position. I received an offer from URBN that would be during the 6 month period for my coop and the pay is 50% higher than my current job. The URBN position will be in a small 3 person team focusing on putting predictive models into production dealing with retail issues as well as some logistics problem solving such as warehouse inventory selection. The plus side of the defense contractor is the rare ability to provide a part-time position that i'd likely be able to continue after the 6-month coop.",Competing Intern Offers: Urban Outfitters vs. Defense Contractor,1578609339

I don't hold an college degree. I am currently employed as a software developer and have 2 1/2 years of experience and I live in eastern europe and work at a big US tech company.
  
I wanted to get a BSc at the minimum, even though I don't think I need it anymore for employability (I've aced most of my job interviews, I tend to interview even when not planning to change jobs just for the practice and see my current market worth).
 
Since I work full time my best option was to do an online degree part-time, and based on my research the Open University is the most reputable institution for that. 

I have an interest in mathematics, and Machine Learning, and the plain ""Computing and IT"" diploma in the OU did not interest me much (I have enough experience in software engineering that I feel most of the modules would be a waste of time, and they are not cheap since I'm self financing).

This is the programme of the course: http://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/qualifications/r38

The Level 1 classes seem fairly basic (especially Introduction to computing and information technology 1 &amp; 2) but based on my research that's normal in the OU (level 1 is very basic whereas 2 and 3 ramp up considerably). 
 
Will this degree be worth anything if I actually decide to switch to work in ML or DS?
 
It's also good to note that the project I work in has a heavy data science side (It's related with fraud analytics), and I will be able to get hands on experience. 
 
If thing's don't change in the next 4 years I might wan't to do a ML masters, either in a brick university full time, or maybe I'm considering the Online master's in computer science by Georgia Tech (OMSCS). If I take that route, will the BSc give me good enough foundations to be successful at the MSc?

I'm starting on february, and could change my path to do Mathematics and Statistics instead of Data Science. The programms share a lot, however DS has ""Applied statistical modelling"" and ""Machine learning and artificial intelligence"" as modules which Mathematics and Statistics does not have.

datascience,"I am a newly hired data scientist a financial services firm. I have a BS in Statistics &amp; Data Science.

One dataset with 1,000,000 rows which I have been given is mixed with the following...

Categorical features: ClientName, ServiceProvidedID, TaxReturnID, Entity, and AccountNumber, and TaxReturnGroup

Continuous features: BookBalance (in dollars)

Text features: TaxReturnSubGroup

The firm had previously used third party sources to develop a classification model where TaxReturnGroup was the target and the predictors were everything described above except TaxReturnSubGroup. This model was made so the tax workers can automate the choosing of the TaxReturnGroup for their clients based on the model predictors. They want to do the same thing for the TaxReturnSubGroup, however, this is a text field (i.e. the tax guys have been typing in this field as they see fit as there is not standard group of labels to choose from). So, they want me to find the optimal standard labels for this field to make it categorical and then iterate on their model making TaxReturnGroup an additional predictor and TaxReturnSubGroup the target classifier. 

My question...

How can I find the optimal standard labels for TaxReturnSubGroup? In other words, how can I convert a text field to a categorical field in an optimized way such that the number of categories is not too large and also the categories are granular/descriptive enough?

The initial idea they have passes on to me is to cluster the data in an optimized way (i.e. find the optimum number of clusters) and then see what kind of TaxReturnSubGroups values exist in each cluster and try to make a standard label for each cluster from there. However I am not sure what the best means to cluster mixed data is or if this is really the best route. After all, I would presume a wide variety of TaxReturnSubGroup values would likely exist in each cluster making it hard to generalize. Is this even an ML problem to begin with?

datascience,"I have a question that I was hoping the hive mind here might be able to help with.

I am a senior data scientist who has been in the field for several years.  I'm mostly self taught, and have worked at large  and small organizations.  My SQL and R programming skills are very strong, I've worked with some of the biggest data sets available, and can do basically whatever I need to in order to do the types of analyses that I'm asked to - which run the gamut from basic descriptive statistics to predictive models.

However, I'm starting to feel like I'm hitting a bit of a ceiling in the field due to my lack of a strong mathematical foundation.  I don't have a degree in computer science, statistics or a STEM field of any kind.  As I consider the next moves for my career, I find that many roles require a masters or PhD in a STEM field... and I find that occasionally in conversations about theory that I don't seem to have as strong as a mathematical background as other data scientists I work with.  

I've been looking at potentially going back for a graduate degree or certificate to augment my ""real-world"" skillset with more theory ... but it seems that many of the 'analytics' and 'data science' programs that exist today focus mostly on teaching basic stats and real-world data manipulation skills.  I don't need to learn how to do a linear regression model in R or how to write complicated SQL queries ... that stuff I know.   

On the flipside, more theoretical graduate programs (MS in Applied Math etc.) seem to require you to have an undergrad STEM degree.  I took Calculus I-III and one stats class but that's it - no differential equations or analysis or anything like that.

So what I'm looking for is a program with some serious coursework in probability theory, mathematical stats, etc. that I can do without literally having to go back 10 years and do college all over again.  

Does anyone here have any experience with any online graduate programs that would provide me with what I'm looking for?

I have to create the logic and basic algorithms for these scripts from scratch by myself and make a script out of it, so that my manager can import these scripts in his jupyter notebooks and run the data through it to get the observations he needs to do his analysis. I don't want to mention the length of my script as usually no of lines of code is a terrible way to measure complexity of the problem. 

I am not sure under what class do I put my current work as  ? Am I doing stuff related to data science, or data analytics or business analytics. 

As I am working with live data, I don't get to use machine learning to do anything. I have been teaching myself machine learning as my masters programme has no courses for it ATM. What else do you think I should focus on, in order to gain more knowledge to become successful in the field of data science ?

The hypothetical situation is that, you have a website where users write let's say movie reviews. So there are in general two types of users on your website, the ones who write normal amount like the rest of us, and the ones who write very often and are so called ""top contributors"".

Now the question is, how would you, using data, to define who are ""top contributors""?

My idea was that, we'll take the last 24 weeks (\~6 months) data, then we take the average daily contributions per user over each week, then we take average of these averages for each user. Then, with the average rate calculated, we can list out the top contributors overall or for each region. So basically:

for each user:

    daily_avg = [# of contributions]/[# of days]   where [# of days]=7 weekly_avg = [sum of daily_avg]/[# of weeks]                        where [# of weeks]=24

1. Does my approach make sense?
2. Would love to learn from your better approaches.

I'm currently undertaking an MRes (master's by research) degree in Evolutionary Biology at a Russell Group (""top 20"") University in the UK. My project involves generating quantitative leaf anatomical datasets and analysing a ton of genomic data, generating phylogenetic trees and performing positive selection analyses for certain genes. Coding in Python and R (along with basic Shell/Unix scripting) are both central to this project, and I've undertaken intensive training courses in both of these languages for my programme. Because I come from a biology background, I wanted to go into academia as a research scientist until very recently, but I have always been equally fascinated in data analysis, manipulation, mining and machine learning; and after taking these respective courses in R and Python, I've decided that I want to work as a data scientist after I leave uni. However, I've recently been offered a PhD in Germany, and the project is to my taste - in the sense that it is very bioinformatics/omics-focussed, and therefore involves dealing with a lot of big (biological) data, and has a significant ML component.

Now, my main question is, to get a job as a data scientist upon leaving uni, which qualification would be of more value: a Master's or a PhD? Would a PhD not make one ""overqualified""? Should I try and get a data science position after I finish my Master's, or is it worth doing a PhD to increase my chances of finding employment?

I looked at it, saw 4.6 and 4.7 star averages and courses with interesting titles and syllabus so I decided to take it and try to power finish it, since I already have some experience.

So I finished first two courses and boy oh boy - what a disaster. It is well expected for this kind of cert to force you use ecosystem of the provider being that google, amazon, IBM or whoever. However, you would expect it to be a WORKING environment. Everything is so outdated in the course notes, software looks nothing like in instructions, some of it even got completely revamped. There are issues with account creation, 503 server response everywhere, loading times in scale of minutes and so on.

At first I thought it was me, my system or location issues, but then you open forums and see hundreds or thousands of complaints that reach back to beginning of 2019 or end of 2018 even. There are band-aid fixes that are sometimes provided, but something that worked 8 months ago doesn't work now since something changed again. All in all a terrible experience.

All of this is just technical problems that made me tell others about this. What I will leave here without much in-depth analysis is the actual quizes and assignments, which I would call at least questionable in the sense how much someone can learn from. Sometimes it feels like it is testing your ability to use IBMs way of doing things, not the actual underlying technology.

Although I saw all this in their second course, I investigated other courses in specialization since i thought this was kind of a non essential topic (using notebooks and other resources). They all follow similar pattern with lot of people feeling disappointed and wanting their money back. From that I decided to bail from it, and felt the need to share this. All of this is easily verifiable by going to said courses, and selecting reviews - then most helpful. Who knows how these courses got such high grade average.
